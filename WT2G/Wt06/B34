Energy is often discussed as if it were a commodity rather than a means 
of providing a wide range of services. In section 1, attention was drawn 
to the importance of first clearly defining the tasks to be done, then 
identifying the most efficient 
way of performing those tasks, and finally supplying the minimum energy 
required with the least environmental impact. Refer to section 3 for 
details on energy specialists that can 
help to define your requirements in this area.<P>

When confronted with the challenge of making buildings comfortable, many 
people think 
of installing effective heating and cooling equipment. But 
properly-designed buildings 
require much less heating and cooling energy, and cheaper, simpler 
heating and cooling equipment to maintain standards of comfort higher 
than can be achieved in buildings 
that are not energy efficient. Installing insulation in buildings not 
only provides 
comfort but also shuts out noise.

<LI>Insulation reduces the heat flow through walls and ceilings by up to 
90 per cent. 
Australian Standard 2627 lists recommended cost-effective insulation 
values for locations 
throughout Australia. These call for, at a minimum, reflective foil 
insulation in 
the walls and foil plus 50 mm blanket in the roof in mild climates, and 
at least R1.5 
batts in walls and R3 bulk insulation in ceilings in colder 
climates.</UL></TD></TR>

<LI>Installation of reflective foil is recommended in sunny areas or 
climates with cold, 
clear nights, as it improves comfort and acts as a vapour barrier. 
Reflective foil 
requires an airspace next to the shiny surface to act as an insulator. 
Ensure that 
foil is not sandwiched between the ceiling lining and the roofing, as 
this negates its 
insulating properties.</UL></TD></TR>

The philosophy of a tourism operation, the building, the availability of 
energy, and 
the climate will influence the approach to heating and cooling, including 
whether 
heating or cooling will be used, and the extent to which they are used. 
Heating and 
cooling costs can comprise up to half of energy costs, and can have 
environmental impacts 
through greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Making buildings

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Coconut Beach Resort in Queensland's Daintree region does 
not have air conditioning 
in its luxury accommodation units. Instead, the units have been designed 
to use natural 
cross-ventilation and shading from surrounding trees to provide comfort 
in a style 
consistent with the area's natural character. The lack of air conditioner 
noise and 
the closeness to nature of the open architecture is appreciated by 
clients. The capital 
and running costs of air conditioning have also been avoided. The 
operators ensure 
that inbound tour operators do not organise for visitors to go from a 
northern hemisphere 
winter to a tropical wet season without some time to acclimatise.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Northern Territory's Yellow Waters Resort has reduced 
the extent to which unoccupied 
units are air conditioned. This measure prevents mould growth in the hot 
humid climate 
and reduced diesel generator fuel consumption and cost dramatically.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Like many resorts, Queensland's Green Island generates 
its own electricity. Unlike 
most resorts, the waste heat from the generator engines is put to good 
use. Cooling 
water from the engines (which is at 70-80 C) is circulated through a heat 
exchanger 
which heats the water in the swimming pool. This system of recovering 
waste heat has 
reduced the amount of heating fuel required to be transported to the 
resort.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Jemby-Rinjah Lodge, at Blackheath in New South Wales' 
Blue Mountains, uses compact 
fluorescent lights in its accommodation units and its central building. 
Many of the 
lights are installed in attractive fittings that are locally-made by 
Eco-Deco from 
recycled materials. These lights reduce energy consumption by lighting 
and the contribution 
of lighting to peak electricity demand by up to 80 per cent. This 
approach not only 
cuts energy bills but also helps maintain total electricity demand within 
the limits of the electricity supply, thus avoiding the capital cost of a 
new transformer.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Freycinet Lodge in Tasmania uses key-tag switches to 
control appliances and lights 
in accommodation units, and light sensors and timer controls to switch 
outdoor lighting 
on and off. Porch lights and path lights, which are on for long periods, 
use compact 
fluorescent lamps.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Cradle Mountain National Park's Visitor Centre in 
Tasmania uses compact fluorescent 
lighting in most areas. Quartz-halogen lights are used to illuminate 
displays and, 
after a recent energy audit, globe wattages have been halved. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Karri Valley Resort in south-west Western Australia has 
just installed compact fluorescent 
lamps in half of the light fittings in its chalets, and in the reception 
area. Timer 
controls are used extensively throughout the resort to switch lights off 
and on at appropriate times.

Toilets must dispose of human waste safely and hygienically. Sensitive 
ecosystems 
can be adversely affected by the nutrients in human wastes, and the 
environment may 
also be affected by large quantities of contaminated water that are 
consumed and 
released by toilets. Reducing the amount of water used by toilets also 
reduces the amount of 
energy used and the costs involved in water pumping and treatment.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Fitzroy Falls Visitor Centre in New South Wales has a 
large experimental composting 
toilet facility, which copes with 8 000 to 16 000 visitors per week, and 
uses both 
conventional composting toilets and worm-boosted ones.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Jemby-Rinjah Lodge in New South Wales' Blue Mountains 
uses composting toilets 
in its holiday cottages, and the operator has found they work well. Air 
from inside 
a cottage is supplied to the composting container. As the air flows from 
the heated 
living area, it warms up the toilet/bathroom and ensures that biological 
activity continues 
in winter. Financial savings have balanced the capital costs, while the 
systems ensure 
there is no impact on the adjacent national park.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Rangers at Cradle Mountain National Park in Tasmania have 
worked with experts at the 
University of Tasmania's Centre for Environmental Studies to develop a 
practical 
dry toilet for use in cold, wet climates. The toilet is designed so that 
solids are 
suspended in a wire mesh container in a closed compartment while liquids 
are evaporated 
off by air moved by a solar-powered fan. Biological breakdown reduces the 
volume 
of solids. The remaining solids are removed during maintenance visits.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Cradle Mountain Lodge has installed a tertiary treatment 
plant for sewage, which is 
monitored daily to ensure that effluent does not impact upon the adjacent 
national 
park. The nearby Visitor Centre shares this facility.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A ventilated improved pit toilet has been developed by 
the Centre for Appropriate 
Technology in Alice Springs. Its spiral entrance path darkens the 
toilet's interior, 
making it less attractive to flies and more private, while the 
ferro-cement roof 
helps keep it cooler. A black-painted vent pipe uses solar heat to 
increase airflow and reduce 
odours.

It also 
reduces transport fuel use, as sites need to be checked less often.

use by moving away from coal-based electricity, and to make a progressive

Washing and drying clothes may consume large amounts of energy. One load 
of washing 
may use up to 200 litres of water (of which a third may be heated), and 
up to a kilowatt-hour 
of electricity (costing 12 to 20 cents) may be used to dry each kilogram 
of washing.<P>

movement sensors are preferable 
to those with a push button timer. Continuous roll cloth towels without 
ready access 
to low impact laundering either on-site or within a short distance may 
not be a good 
environmental option unless usage rates are very high. Choosing between 
these alternatives 
will depend on operational efficiency and client

Refrigerators play an important role in preserving food. Their energy use 
can generate 
up to 10 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from accommodation units 
and 5 per 
cent of total emissions from a tourism operation.<P>

<LI>Good ventilation around coils on the backs of refrigerators is 
essential. Installing 
a bar-fridge in a timber cabinet without ventilation-common practice in 
motels-can 
increase running cost by 50 per cent and overwork the unit, so it cannot 
produce 
ice. Inlet and outlet ventilation slots, each at least 50 square 
centimetres, should be cut 
in the cabinet to allow substantial airflow. If noise is a problem, the 
refrigerator 
should be mounted on a rubber mat and the timber cabinet lined with 
sound-absorbing 
material.</UL></TD></TR>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Wild Quest Safaris, Northern Territory, uses photovoltaic

the need 
for noisy generators.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Odyssey Safaris in the Northern Territory uses 60-litre 
Trailblazer 12 volt refrigerators 
on tour. The brand was chosen because of its excellent insulation. The 
units run 
from the vehicle battery when on the move, and from a spare battery 
charged by a 
solar panel when stopped.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Bungaree Earth Cottages in New South Wales are not 
connected to the electricity grid. 
LPG refrigerators are used to minimise electricity requirements, so that 
the number 
of photovoltaic cells needed to provide for basic services (lighting, 
radio) can 
be kept to an affordable level.

Office equipment uses significant amounts of electricity. A desktop 
computer can cost 
$100 per annum to run and a photocopier $300 if left on most of the time. 
Office 
equipment also uses a lot of energy indirectly, through its consumption 
of paper.

The Australian Government has a target of reducing the amount of solid 
waste going 
to landfill by 50 per cent (on a weight per capita basis) between 1990 
and 2000. 
Attaining this target requires a significant reversal of past trends of 
ever-increasing 
solid waste generation. Many businesses have significantly reduced their 
solid waste streams 
in the last few years, and municipalities are beginning to replace 
household 240-litre 
garbage bins with 120-litre and 80-litre bins. General actions that can 
be taken to minimise the generation of solid waste are outlined in this 
Reference Sheet. More 
specific actions that can be taken for particular materials are given in 
Reference 
Sheets 16 and 18-23.

The generation and disposal of solid waste from building construction and 
demolition 
is a major problem in Australia. Construction and demolition waste is 
estimated to 
comprise about 20 per cent of the weight of material currently going to 
landfill. 
Until very recently this problem received very little attention.

Australia has been recycling newspapers and cardboard, particularly 
industry offcuts, 
into packaging materials for over 100 years. Before 1994, when a new 
machine was 
commissioned by Australian Newsprint Mills at Albury, NSW, newspapers and 
magazines 
were not recycled back into newsprint in Australia. The international 
market for newspapers 
and magazines has been particularly volatile over the past five to ten 
years. The 
current situation is buoyant and expected demand and prices for recycled 
newspaper 
and cardboard for the next few years are good.

Over 80 per cent of the glass used in Australia is used for packaging. 
Until the mid-1980s, 
refillable glass was the dominant form of packaging for drinks. Most 
glass food containers 
(those for tomato sauce, sandwich spreads etc) are not refilled. Under 
the influence of beverage container deposit legislation, refillable glass 
drink containers 
have remained popular in South Australia. In the rest of Australia, 
refillable containers 
have been largely replaced by a mixture of lighter-weight, non-refillable 
glass, aluminium, plastic and liquid paperboard containers. About 45 per 
cent of glass 
packaging is recycled in Australia (mostly by crushing into cullet and

Over the last few decades, plastic wastes, particularly plastic packaging 
wastes, 
have comprised the fastest growing part of the solid waste stream. They 
are a highly 
visible component of litter and have had a significant impact on 
wildlife, particularly 
in aquatic ecosystems. The problems arise largely because the long-life 
plastics are 
put to relatively short-term uses. However, where the long-life 
attributes of plastics 
are put to long-term uses such as in appliances and equipment, and in 
plumbing and 
gas fitting, they may have less environmental impact than alternatives, 
such as metal 
and ceramics. The light weight of plastics can also be beneficial in 
increasing the 
efficacy of products and reducing transport fuel. At present, about 30 
per cent of 
plastics in Australia are used for packaging.

<LI>Plastics recycling is even more complicated than paper recycling. 
With the introduction 
of a plastics coding system in the late 1980s many people have mistakenly 
interpreted 
the appearance of a number from 1 to 7 inside a triangle with chasing 
arrows to indicate that systems existed to recycle the items bearing 
these symbols. This is not 
the case; many plastic items bearing this code are not currently being 
recycled in 
Australia. The items most commonly being recycled at present are plastic 
bottles 
bearing the codes 1 (PET), 2 (HDPE) and 3 (PVC).</UL></TD></TR>

through kerbside collection or depot 
drop-off, check with your recycler exactly what plastics are being 
collected. In 
some areas all bottles (shampoo, detergent, milk etc.) bearing the symbol 
2 are collected, while in others only milk bottles are collected. Putting 
non-recyclable plastics 
into recycle bins can cause expensive contamination problems for the 
collector. If 
you lack information on recycling plastics, ask your collector or council 
to provide 
it. However, remember that they are not responsible for putting recycling

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Odyssey Safaris in the Northern Territory provides 
passengers with colour-coded, re-useable 
plastic cups for drinks which are washed by staff at the end of each day. 
The company 
also uses unbreakable plastic plates and dishes and stainless steel 
cutlery. These practices not only create a positive environmental image, 
but are cheap. The 
plastic require less storage space when on tour. Odyssey has calculated 
that the 
lifecycle cost of a re-useable cup plus washing is $23, while the cost of 
disposable 
cups over a year is $54 (and this does not include any costs for 
disposing of a large volume 
of used cups).

Australia has well-developed infrastructure for the recycling of 
aluminium cans and 
the highest rate of recycling of aluminium cans in the world. Large steel 
items such 
as cars, whitegoods, concrete reinforcing and drums are also widely 
recycled but 
until recently little attention has been paid to the recycling of steel 
cans. Responses 
to the energy and waste minimisation survey carried out for this project 
indicated 
that five times more aluminium cans than steel cans were being recycled.

Cardboard, paper, garden waste, sewage sludge and some food scraps (not

worms. After 
three to four months, the worm castings are used on gardens instead of

<P ALIGN="LEFT">At Yellow Waters in the Northern Territory, a pump ran 
continuously, topping up the 
header tank for the fresh water supply. Excess water overflowed and ran 
back down 
to a lagoon. To reduce energy and cut costs, a float switch was been 
installed which 
switches the pump off when the header tank is full. An effluent pump 
which used to run 
continuously and required replacement four times each year is now also 
controlled 
by a float switch, which has dramatically reduced operating time.

While most ecotourism operations emphasise their links with the natural

in their marketing and promotion, there is substantial scope to 
demonstrate a commitment 
to environmental best practice by implementing and promoting energy and 
waste minimisation strategies. After all, energy use and wastes are two 
major environmental impacts 
of human activity.

<H2><B>Message from the Chairman</H2></B><IMG SRC="Chairman.GIF" 
WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=181 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>This issue of <I>Forecast</I> marks the completion of the Council's 
initial priority task: to develop broad-scale trip forecasts for 
domestic, inbound and outbound tourism.</B>
<P>
Detailed forecasts of international visitor arrivals to the year 2003 and 
of overseas travel by Australians to 1998-99 have been developed and are 
detailed in this issue, complementing the forecasts of domestic travel 
released in August last year.
<P>
This gives the 'big picture' of Australian tourism activity: an inbound 
sector continuing to show strong growth, with arrivals projected to 
increase at an average annual rate of 11 per cent to reach 6.3 million in 
2000; a sound domestic sector underpinning the industry and projected to 
show solid growth of 1.6 per cent a year to 1998-99; and an outbound 
sector forecast to grow at 9 per cent a year, on average, over the next 
five years.
<P>
It is encouraging to know that our recent rapid gains in tourism are 
likely to be consolidated and strengthened over the coming years, but it 
is the impact of this increased tourism that is of most interest to 
industry operators and planners.
<P>
The Council's first steps in this direction are also reported in this 
issue. The impact of international tourism growth has been quantified in 
terms of expenditure, the number of nights spent in Australia, and the 
number of nights spent in hotels, motels and guest houses. Although there 
is still some way to go before we can forecast such indicators as hotel 
occupancy rates and room rates by region, these results represent a 
quantum leap in progress in a little over 12 months.
<P>
To complement these more traditional forecasts, the Council has also 
developed leading indicators of tourism activity. Leading indicators have 
not previously been used to predict tourism activity in Australia, so 
this has been a ground-breaking initiative for the Council.
<P>
The need for more detailed forecasting is highlighted in the report on 
recent hotel activity.  Nationally, the sector is showing continuing 
improvement, but the strength of this recovery varies significantly 
between  States.
<P>
As a result, the Council's priorities now are to develop a more detailed 
picture of where tourists will be going in Australia and how long they 
will stay at their destinations.
<P>
In the next issue of <I>Forecast</I> we plan to provide projections of 
domestic visitor nights and domestic nights in hotel/motel accommodation 
to complement the international forecasts presented in this issue.
<P>
By the end of this year, the Council will provide forecasts of domestic 
and international visitation to regions within Australia, including 
demand for hotel/motel accommodation. The Council will also update its 
forecasts regularly to keep up to date with changing conditions. Revised 
forecasts of domestic travel are scheduled for this year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Council's work is progressing well. I urge investors and operators to 
take the time to become familiar with these forecasts and to use them in 
their business planning. I also invite readers to come back to the 
Council with specific suggestions about further information that would be 
helpful in their business planning.

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4 ALIGN=Center><P>
<P>
<I>In the year 2000, 6.3 million people are expected to visit Australia - 
more than double the number that visited in 1993. For the next 10 years, 
inbound tourism is expected to grow by an average 10 per cent a year, 
maintaining its position as the fastest growing sector of Australia's 
tourism industry. </I>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Visitor.GIF" WIDTH=325 HEIGHT=429 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3

<P>
<B>I</B>nbound tourism is one of Australia's fastest growing industries, 
employing about 130 000 people either directly or indirectly and, in 
1993-94, generating $10.6 billion in export earnings. Between 1983 and 
1993, the number of international visitors increased from 944 000 to 3 
million, an average annual growth rate of 12 per cent.
<P>
High rates of growth are forecast to continue over the next decade, led 
by the growth of the rapidly developing Asian markets. Inbound tourism 
will be an increasingly important generator of jobs and income for 
Australia. 
<P>
The Council's forecasts of international visitor arrivals were developed 
using a combination of quantitative and qualitative 
techniques.
<P>

<B><I>Japan</I></B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Table1p6.GIF" WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=523 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3  
ALIGN=RIGHT><P>
Japan currently accounts for 22 per cent of all visitors to Australia. 
After slowing in 1994 and 1995 as a result of the economic slowdown in 
Japan, the growth in visitor arrivals from Japan is expected to be 
moderate over the rest of the forecast period.
<P>

Travel and leisure are becoming increasingly important to the Japanese 
public, and Australia is well positioned to capitalise on growth in 
several emerging market segments. In particular, given its range of 
attractions and strong image as a 'big nature' destination, Australia 
should benefit from increasing Japanese interest in ecotourism and 
independent travel. An increased marketing focus in Japan and coverage of 
the Sydney 2000 Olympics should also heighten Australia's image as a 
holiday destination for Japanese travellers.
<P>
While there are some negative factors for Australia, including increased 
price consciousness in the market and the growth in marketing costs, on 
balance the positive factors are expected to significantly outweigh them.

<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="Fig1p7.GIF" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=168 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT>
The number of visitors from Japan is forecast to increase from 671 000 in 
1993 to more than 1 million by 1999 and to nearly 1.5 million by 2003 
(Table 1 and Figure 1). Growth is forecast to average just over 8 per 
cent a year, which will easily maintain Japan's position as the largest 
source country for international visitors to Australia. These forecasts 
were developed before the earthquake that devastated the region around 
Kobe on 17 January 1995. The earthquake is expected to affect overall 
outbound travel from Japan, including to Australia. The duration and 
magnitude of this effect is not yet clear but is expected to be 
short-term. 
<P>


Over the past 10 years Australia's share of the outbound Japanese market 
increased strongly. Over the forecast period, a further slight gain in 
market share is expected.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B><I>Other Asian markets</I></B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Table2p7.GIF" WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=517 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT>
Other Asian countries are becoming increasingly significant as sources of 
inbound tourism. By 1993, these countries accounted for 23 per cent of 
all visitors to Australia, with arrivals from Korea and Taiwan increasing 
by more than 50 per cent every year.
<P>

Strong economic growth, rapidly rising incomes and the easing of 
restrictions on travel have resulted in the populations of a number of 
East and South-East Asian countries travelling more extensively. 
Australia is well positioned to benefit from these developments over the 
next decade and beyond. Australia's share of outbound travel from most 
Asian countries is expected to grow over the forecast period, 
particularly in the next five years or so.
<P>
With the exception of 1983, 1984 and 1990, the Hong Kong market has grown 
rapidly since 1980 (see Table 2). Strong economic growth in <B>Hong 
Kong</B> is expected to result in continued growth in arrivals from this 
market over the period. There may be an exception in 1997, due to the 
transition from British to Chinese administration.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="Fig2p7.GIF" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=213 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=RIGHT>
The number of visitors from Hong Kong is forecast to increase from 92 000 
in 1993 to 269 000 in 2003, an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent 
(Figure 2).
<P>
In 1993 visitor arrivals from <B>Indonesia </B>increased by 57 per cent. 
Although growth in arrivals from this market has really only occurred 
since 1986, it suggests a market 'take off'. Expectations of continued 
strong economic growth in Indonesia suggest rapid growth in visitor 
arrivals for the entire forecast period. Expanding ties with Indonesia, 
geographic proximity and the increasing propensity of a rapidly growing 
middle class to travel are all positive factors for this market. 
Increasing awareness of Australia as a tourism destination and increased 
marketing activity should also underpin growth.
<P>
Arrivals from Indonesia are forecast to increase from 72 000 in 1993 to 
more than 500 000 by 2003, an annual average growth rate of 22 per cent.
<P>
The recent growth in arrivals from <B>Korea</B> has been extraordinary - 
arrivals have increased sixfold in the past five years and nearly doubled 
in 1993 alone.
<P>
With a large population, a strong economy and a relatively low rate of 
outbound travel, Korea appears to have ample opportunity for further 
growth in travel to Australia. Factors such as a growing middle class, 
the desire to experience Western culture and the continuing impact of 
Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) promotional activities also suggest a 
very optimistic outlook for this market.
<P>
The number of visitors from Korea is forecast to reach nearly 500 000 in 
2003, which will firmly entrench Korea as one of Australia's top 10 
markets.
<P>
Growth in the <B>Malaysian</B> market has been generally strong, but 
variable, since the early 1980s. Growth was particularly strong in 1992 
and 1993, and this is expected to continue over the forecast period.
<P>
The growth in the middle class, an increased propensity for long-haul 
travel, an increased desire to visit Western countries (of which 
Australia is the closest) and new, more focused marketing by the ATC are 
all positive signs for growth. The only negative factor appears to be 
increased competition for the market.
<P>
The number of visitors from Malaysia is forecast to increase from 80 000 
in 1993 to about 330 000 by 2003, an average annual growth rate of more 
than 15 per cent.
<P>
The <B>Singapore</B> market has performed consistently for some time, 
with double-digit growth in all but two years since 1980. Arrivals are 
closely related to changes in economic growth and in the relative 
exchange rate. Given Singapore's continued healthy economic growth, the 
level of arrivals is expected to continue to increase rapidly.
<P>
Singaporeans have demonstrated a taste for travel, and anecdotal evidence 
suggests that short breaks (including those to Australia) are becoming an 
accepted part of the Singaporeans' lifestyle. An apparent move towards 
special interest travel is a further positive indicator for Australia.
<P>
The number of visitors from Singapore is forecast to increase from 155 
000 in 1993 to 424 000 in 2003, an average annual growth rate of more 
than 10 per cent. This growth will maintain Singapore among Australia's 
top 10 markets, although by the end of the forecast period its current 
ranking is likely to have been overtaken by other Asian markets.
<P>
Like Korea, <B>Taiwan</B> has recently emerged as a booming market, with 
arrivals quadrupling in the past three years to reach 108 000 in 1993. 
Strong growth continued in 1994.
<P>
The rapid expansion of the middle class is a significant factor in this 
market. In addition, the emergence of young women office workers as 
prospective travellers, an increasing interest in market segments such as 
nature-based travel, and a strong ATC promotional commitment to Taiwan 
should see this market perform well in both the short and medium term. In 
the medium to long term, however, the probability of direct air links 
with China and increased competition from other destinations may have 
some dampening effect.
<P>
The number of visitors from Taiwan is forecast to increase to just under 
500 000 by 2003, at an average annual growth rate of 16 per cent. By the 
end of the forecast period, however, growth is expected to be in single 
digits.
<P>
Tourism from <B>Thailand</B> has also grown rapidly in recent years, 
following a patchy performance in the early 1980s. Analysis suggests that 
less than 2 per cent of the Thai population currently travels. However, 
there is a rapidly expanding middle class and an increasing desire to 
experience Western culture, and travel is becoming more important 
socially. Australia appears well positioned to capitalise on growth in 
several important market segments including adventure travel and 
nature-based tourism, and the Sydney 2000 Olympics is likely to provide 
another positive stimulus.
<P>
The number of visitors from Thailand is forecast to increase from 47 000 
in 1993 to 309 000 in 2003, an average annual growth rate of more than 20 
per cent. Thailand is expected to be one of the fastest growing markets.
<P>
Although the Asian outlook certainly appears to be very bright, 
significant outbound leisure travel and rapid growth in arrivals from 
these countries has been only  a relatively recent phenomenon. As a 
result, there is significantly more uncertainty attached to the forecasts 
for many of these countries than for Australia's more established source 
markets. 
<P>
This uncertainty is greatest for tourism from <B>China</B> and 
<B>India</B>. In 1993, there were 22 300 arrivals from China and 9 800 
from India, together accounting for 1 per cent of all visitors to 
Australia. Given the large populations of these two countries and their 
potential for continued rapid social and economic change, there is a 
possibility of strong growth in outbound travel from both, which could 
have significant implications for the forecasts in the longer term.
<P>
However, given the uncertainties involved, no attempt has been made to 
separately quantify these markets. Instead, the growth in arrivals from 
both countries has been assumed to be at the same rate as for non-Japan 
Asia as a whole. This assumption will be reviewed when the forecasts are 
revised and updated.
<P>

In 1993, Europe accounted for 21 per cent of visitor arrivals to 
Australia. This market is dominated by the United Kingdom, but Germany is 
becoming more important and France is also showing promise (Figure 3).
<P>
In recent years, the overall growth in the number of visitors from Europe 
has been moderate. There are significant differences in the rates of 
growth expected from different countries over the forecast period (Figure 
4), and by the end of 2003 Europe is expected to account for 19 per cent 
of total arrivals. Overall, only small changes in Australia's share of 
European markets is expected, but prospects vary significantly for 
individual markets.<P>
<P>
The pattern of growth in arrivals from <B>France</B> has been quite 
uneven. In its segmentation analysis, the ATC identified France as a 
market of large untapped potential, suggesting that historical experience 
is likely to underestimate growth. Arrivals from France appear to be 
highly sensitive to economic growth, with a small lag.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="Fig3p7.GIF" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=224 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT>

The number of visitors from France is forecast to more than treble, from 
31 000 in 1993 to nearly 100 000 by 2003, an average annual growth rate 
of 12 per cent. France is expected to be the strongest growing European 
market, albeit from a small base.
<P>
Apart from a slowdown in growth since 1990, the <B>German</B> market has 
performed well since 1985. A growing interest in long-haul travel, the 
possibility of air charters opening up new interest, the leverage to be 
gained from Partnership Australia, and the Sydney 2000 Olympics all point 
to a positive outlook for this market. There appears to be large 
underlying potential for growth from Germany, and the ATC proposes to 
increase its marketing activity there.
<P>
The number of visitors from Germany is forecast to increase from 106 000 
in 1993 to 317 000 in 2003, an average annual growth rate of 11.6 per 
cent.
<P>
With some isolated exceptions, the growth in arrivals from <B>Italy</B> 
is forecast to slow from about 10 per cent a year to just over 5 per cent 
by 2003. From 1994 to 2003, arrivals should double, reaching 78 000 by 
the end of the forecast period.
<P>
The Dutch market has been patchy during the 1980s and 1990s, but there is 
some evidence of growth since 1989. The number of visitors from <B>the 
Netherlands</B> is forecast to increase from 27 000 in 1993 to 56 000 in 
2003, an average annual growth rate of nearly 8 per cent.
<P>
The outlook for growth in arrivals from <B>Switzerland</B> is also 
positive, and the number of visitors is expected to more than double from 
31 000 in 1993 to 65 000 in 2003.
<P>
The <B>United Kingdom</B> is an important and well-established market. 
With 321 000 visitor arrivals in 1993, it ranked behind only Japan and 
New Zealand. Economic growth, movements in exchange rates and the level 
of past arrivals suggest that moderate growth  of between 5 and 6 per 
cent a year can be expected from the United Kingdom.
<P>
The effect of air charter operators expanding the market through low 
prices, an increasing interest in long-haul travel, and the combined 
effect of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the Centenary of Federation should 
contribute to this growth.

<P>
The number of visitors from the United Kingdom is forecast to reach 570 
000 by 2003, and it should remain the third largest source of arrivals.
<P>
<B><I>North America</I></B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Fig4p9.GIF" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=195 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=RIGHT>
While the <B>United States</B> market performed strongly up until 1987 
and in the 1988 Expo/Bicentenary year, performance since then has been 
poor. Economic growth, exchange rates and the level of past arrivals 
suggest only moderate growth in arrivals (Figure 4).
<P>
The number of visitors from the United States is forecast to increase 
from 281 000 in 1993 to 477 000 in 2003, an annual average rate of 5.4 
per cent. Projections are that the United States will lose its position 
as Australia's fourth largest market, to be passed by Indonesia, Taiwan 
and Korea.
<P>
The number of arrivals from <B>Canada</B> is forecast to increase from 51 
000 in 1993 to 77 000 in 2003, an average annual growth rate of just over 
4 per cent.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<B><I>New Zealand</I></B>
<P>
With 500 000 New Zealanders visiting Australia in 1993, New Zealand is 
Australia's second largest tourist market. This market declined in the 
early 1980s, grew rapidly from 1985 to 1989, and has since fluctuated 
without regaining its 1989 peak. 
<P><IMG SRC="Fig5p9.GIF" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=174 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>
Somewhat perversely, New Zealand's economic recovery and its closeness to 
Australia may work against growth in this market - with increasing 
prosperity, New Zealanders, who are already familiar with Australia as a 
destination, may choose longer-haul destinations. An increased tendency 
to take short breaks and interest in event-related travel, however, may 
work in Australia's favour. The Sydney 2000 Olympics are expected to have 
a marked impact on New Zealand arrivals in the Games year.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On balance, only slow growth of about 3 per cent a year is forecast for 
this market. Arrivals are forecast to rise to 669 000 by 2003 (Figure 5). 
Even so, New Zealand should remain the second largest source of arrivals 
to Australia. 
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Summary </B>
<P>
The number of international visitors to Australia is forecast to increase 
from 3 million in 1993 to 3.35 million in 1994, 6.3 million in 2000 and 
7.6 million in 2003 (Figure 6). The average annual growth rate is 
forecast to be just under 10 per cent for the period 1993-2003, but that 
figure will vary from year to year, from 12 to 13 per cent now to about 5 
per cent by 2003.
<P>
<IMG SRC="Fig6p9.GIF" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=222 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT>
The Sydney Olympic Games should lead to a relatively small increase in 
the growth rate in the year 2000. However, the Games are among many 
positive factors influencing arrivals forecasts and are expected to have 
a positive impact on visitor numbers in every year of the forecast 
period.
<P>
Australian tourism clearly stands to benefit from increasing links with 
the fast - growing economies of Asia, and Australia's  share of these 
markets should continue to expand.
<P>
Japan is expected to remain the largest source country. Arrivals are 
forecast to more than double, from 671 000 in 1993 to 1.456 million in 
2003 (Figure 6). This forecast does not, however, take into account any 
effects from the 17 January earthquake that devastated the Kobe region. 
Arrivals from other Asian markets are expected to increase from 683 000 
in 1993 to 3 million in 2003, an average annual growth rate of 16 per 
cent. Indonesia, Taiwan and South Korea are all expected to provide about 
500 000 visitors a year in 2003.
<P>
From 1983 to 1993, the number of visitors from Asia (including Japan) 
increased from 205 000 (22 per cent of total visitor numbers) to 1.4 
million (45 per cent of the total). Over the next decade, this number is 
forecast to reach 4.5 million, or 59 per cent of all visitors to 
Australia.
<P>
Arrivals from established markets such as Europe and the United States 
are already reflecting the world economic recovery. The development of 
more special interest products and the additional publicity generated by 
the Olympics should see these markets grow over the medium to long term.
<P>
European markets such as Germany and France also show potential for 
strong growth, as long-haul travel becomes more popular and awareness of 
Australia as a holiday destination increases.
<P>
While the outlook is bright, some uncertainty surrounds the forecasting 
exercise. In particular, it is difficult to estimate with precision the 
potential of emerging Asian markets. South Korea and Taiwan, for example, 
are currently exhibiting extremely rapid growth, but from a fairly small 
base. Outbound tourism from these countries is a recent phenomenon and, 
as a result, the future rate of expansion, and behaviour and destination 
choices of travellers, must be estimated using scant historical data. 
Government and industry should be aware of the uncertainty involving the 
emerging Asian markets when using these forecasts for investment, 
planning and policy decisions.<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4 ALIGN=Center><P>
<H2><B>How the forecasts were developed</B></H2>
<P>
Economic theory suggests that the decision to travel is related to 
people's ability to pay for the travel service (<B>income</B> variables) 
and to the <B>price</B> of the travel compared with other goods and 
services (including, in this case, travel to other destinations).
<P>
Econometric models have been used extensively for forecasting tourism 
trends, and in many markets have quite high levels of reliability. 
However, they also have their limitations. For example, the historical 
relationship between arrivals and income and price variables will almost 
certainly not explain all the variation in arrivals. Changes in consumer 
behaviour, changes in government policy, or any number of other events 
may mean that the past relationship is not always a good guide to the 
future.
<P>
In addition, it is not possible to be certain about the future path of 
income and price variables, so that even if all historical variations 
could be accounted for, there would still be uncertainty about future 
trends.
<P>
The Council's approach aimed to address these difficulties. Gross 
Domestic Product was used as the broad income variable. The real relative 
exchange rate between Australia and the source market was used as the 
price variable.
<P>
Simple econometric models were then used to estimate the historical 
relationship between economic and other variables and movements in 
visitor arrivals. These models were used to project arrivals to the year 
2003, taking into account the extent to which past relationships could be 
expected to hold in the future.
<P>
Following the development of these models, a comprehensive list of 
factors likely to influence future arrivals from each source market was 
compiled, drawing on Australian Tourist Commission market information. 
These factors were classified as to whether their effect on future 
arrivals was likely to be positive or negative and weighted according to 
their likely influence. The model results were then adjusted by the 
balance of positive and negative factors in each year.
<P>
The final forecasts represent a view of the 'most likely' outcome for 
arrivals from each market. However, it needs to be remembered that 
forecasts are sensitive to the assumptions used in their derivation, and 
for that reason are subject to significant uncertainty.
<P>
The Council will continue to evaluate and refine its methodology in the 
light of feedback and consultation with users and industry experts. A 
revised set of inbound forecasts is expected to be released in about 12 
months.

<H1><B>International visitor nights and expenditure in Australia</B></H1>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4 ALIGN=Center><P>
<P><I>The boost to the Australian economy provided by international 
tourism is likely to increase significantly between now and 2003. 
Spending by international tourists is expected to grow by an average 
annual rate of 9 per cent, visitor nights by about 8 per cent a year, and 
visitor nights in hotels, motels and guest houses by almost 11 per cent a 
year.</I>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Intpeople.GIF" WIDTH=261 HEIGHT=306 HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>I</B>nternational tourism is likely to have an increasingly 
significant impact on the Australian economy during the 10 years to 2003. 
Expenditure by international tourists is forecast to grow at an average 
annual rate of 9 per cent, from just over $6 billion in 1993 to almost 
$15 billion in 2003. Visitor nights are expected to increase at an 
average annual rate of about 8 per cent  and visitor nights in hotels, 
motels and guest houses by almost 11 per cent. 
<P>
The increase in visitor arrival numbers is the main driving force behind 
these growth rates, but the results are strongly influenced by the 
assumption that there will be a significant decline in the average 
duration of stay of visitors from the Other Asia market (all of Asia, 
except Japan).
<P>
Compared to arrivals, overall visitor nights are forecast to grow 
relatively slowly, from 69 million in 1993 to 144 million in 2003. The 
fastest growth is expected to occur in the Other Europe and Other Asia 
markets. By 2003 the Other Asia market will make up about 29 per cent of 
total visitor nights spent by international visitors in Australia - up 
from 25 per cent in 1993 but significantly below its 40 per cent share of 
total arrivals.
<P>
In contrast, visitor nights in hotels, motels and guest houses are 
expected to grow even more quickly than visitor arrivals. By the year 
2000 it is likely that about 32 million visitor nights will be spent in 
this form of accommodation - up from 15 million in 1993. Again, changes 
in the Other Asia market are mainly responsible for the variation. It is 
expected that visitors from this region will spend a greater proportion 
of nights in hotels, motels and guest houses as the market grows.
<P>
Two components of total tourism expenditure have been forecast: direct 
expenditure in Australia and the Australian component of prepaid package 
tours. No attempt has been made to forecast the balance of payments 
contribution of the tourism industry. However, the results from the other 
forecasts suggest that tourism will maintain its position as Australia's

<B>Visitor nights</B>
<P>
The number of international visitors to Australia has risen over the past 
decade, but visitors' average duration of stay has declined, particularly 
since 1989. Consequently, the total nights spent in Australia by 
international visitors has not risen as quickly as visitor arrivals. This 
decline has been caused largely by a change in the type of visitors 
arriving in Australia. 
<P>
Further changes are expected in the forecast period of 1993 to 2003, 
particularly in the Other Asia and New Zealand markets. The average 
duration of stay of international visitors is expected to decline 
further.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Trends in average duration of stay</B>
<P>
<B><I>Other Asia</I></B>
<P>
The average duration of stay for visitors from the Other Asia group of 
countries has fallen quite dramatically over the past three years. This 
fall has been associated with two factors:
<P>

<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> The proportion of holiday visitors has risen - from 54 per cent in 
1990 to 69 per cent in 1993. As can be seen in Table 1, the duration of 
stay of holiday visitors is about one-quarter that of other visitors.
<P>
<LI> The average duration of stay of holiday visitors has fallen. The 
rapid rise in arrivals from markets such as Taiwan and Korea has been 
associated with a change in the type of holiday maker arriving from Other 
Asia. In the past, visitors tended to stay for a little over two weeks; 
now they are staying a little over one week.
</UL>
<IMG SRC="Table1p13.GIF" WIDTH=337 HEIGHT=165 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>
Both trends are expected to continue over the next 10 years. Accompanying 
the expected tremendous growth in arrivals from the Other Asia market 
will be an increase in the proportion of holiday makers. The profile of 
these visitors is expected to be similar to that of the relatively 
short-staying Japanese. However, given established education, family and 
business links that already exist between Australia and a number of 
countries in the region (particularly Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia), 
it is likely that the proportion of holiday makers from the Other Asia 
market will stay below the Japanese level of 90 per cent. The lower 
proportion of holiday makers will keep the average duration of stay of 
visitors from the Other Asia market above that of visitors from Japan for 
the forecast period. By 2003, the average duration of stay is expected to 
stabilise.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B><I>New Zealand</I></B>
<P>
The average duration of stay for visitors from New Zealand has fallen 
over the past 10 years, from more than 20 nights in the early 1980s to 
about 17 nights in recent years.
<P>
This fall is not due to a change in the purpose of visit - the proportion 
of the long-staying 'Visiting Relatives' segment has remained at about 28 
per cent of New Zealand arrivals for the past 10 years. It appears, 
instead, that New Zealanders are having shorter and more frequent 
holidays to Australia.
<P>
This trend is in line with the Australian Tourist Commission's marketing 
strategy in New Zealand, which promotes Australia as a short-stay 
destination. Some further reinforcement is expected from a long-term 
decline in airfares on the trans-Tasman route. Overall, the average 
duration of stay of New Zealanders will decline over the forecast period, 
but at a decreasing rate.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B><I>United States, Japan, Canada</I></B>
<P>
The average duration of stay for visitors from the United States, Japan 
and Canada has remained relatively stable over the past 10 years, despite 
quite significant growth in total arrivals. Growth in visitor arrivals 
will continue to be steady, and there is no indication that this growth 
will involve a significant change in the mix of visitors arriving. For 
this reason it is assumed that, over the forecast period, the average 
duration of stay of visitors from these markets will be constant at 
1991-93 levels.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B><I>United Kingdom, Ireland and Other Europe</I></B>
<P>
The duration of stay for visitors from the United Kingdom, Ireland and 
Other Europe markets has varied considerably over the past 10 years, 
rising in the late 1980s and falling during the 1990s.
<P>
The recent drop in duration of stay appears to be due to changes in the 
mix of travellers. Although the proportion of holiday makers grew 
strongly from 1985 to 1991, it has been relatively stable for the past 
three years. 
<P>
There appears to have been a shift in the type of holiday maker coming to 
Australia. This shift could be due to the availability of cheaper 
airfares and more direct airline services since 1990, which have made 
shorter Australian holidays a more viable option. It is expected that 
these trends will continue for at least the next few years as the 
development of charter services and the availability of relatively cheap 
airfares make Australia a more attractive option for Europeans looking 
for two- to three-week holidays.
<P>
It is assumed that over the next few years the average duration of stay 
of visitors from these markets will continue to fall, but at a declining 
rate. It is then likely to stabilise.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>


The forecast average duration of stay of short-term visitors to 
Australia, based on these assumptions, is shown in Table 2.

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
The visitor nights projections for the years 1995 to 2003 (Table 3) have 
been calculated using forecasts of international visitor arrivals by the 
Tourism Forecasting Council and the preceding projections of average 
duration of stay.
<IMG SRC="Table3p14.GIF" WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=448 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
The forecast decline in the average duration of stay significantly 
reduces the impact of the rapid growth in arrivals, particularly from the 
Other Asia market, on tourism sectors other than international transport. 
Figure 1 shows that, while arrivals from the Other Asia market are 
forecast to rise by more than 250 per cent by the year 2000, visitor 
nights are expected to rise by just over 100 per cent.
<IMG SRC="Fig1p17.GIF" WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=173 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
These forecasts are very sensitive to the assumptions that have been made 
about the duration of stay of visitors from the Other Asia market (Table 
4). The forecast assumes a quite rapid decline in the average duration of 
stay of Other Asian visitors, from 25 nights in 1993, to 14 nights in 
2000. Variations in this decline can be seen to have significant 
implications for total visitor nights spent by international visitors in 
Australia, as well as visitor nights spent by visitors from the Other 
Asia market.

<B>International visitor nights in hotels, motels and guest houses</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Table5p15.GIF" WIDTH=338 HEIGHT=201 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
At present about 23 per cent of international visitor nights are spent in 
hotels, motels and guest houses. This ratio varies considerably across 
the major markets (see Table 5)
<P>
These differences appear to be caused by variations in three factors: the 
proportion of holiday makers from each market, the proportion of visitors 
from a market visiting friends and relatives, and the type of holiday 
maker attracted from a market. For all markets, holiday travellers spend 
more nights in commercial accommodation than do non-holiday visitors. 
Travellers visiting friends and relatives spend significantly less time 
in commercial accommodation than other visitors. Visitors from Japan, who 
tend to have relatively short stays, tend to use more hotels, motels and 
guest houses than, for example, long-staying backpackers from the United 
Kingdom.
<P>
A change in the percentage of nights spent in hotels, motels and guest 
houses by visitors from a particular market would be expected if there 
were a significant change in one or more of these variables. For most 
markets (United States, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Other Europe and 
United Kingdom) no factor could be identified that would suggest such a 
change would be likely. 
<P>
However, the Other Asia market appears to be undergoing a period of 
significant change - the proportion of holiday travellers is increasing, 
and the proportion of travellers who come to visit friends and relatives 
is decreasing. As a result, the proportion of nights spent by visitors 
from this market in hotel and motel accommodation is growing. This 
proportion is expected to continue to increase for the forecast period, 
from 18 per cent in 1993 to 42 per cent in 2003.
<P>The effect of these trends is shown in Table 6. Total nights spent in 
hotels, motels and guest houses by all international visitors to 
Australia are forecast to increase at an average annual rate of 10.6 per 
cent. 
<IMG SRC="Table6p15.GIF" WIDTH=335 HEIGHT=400 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>
Because many guests at hotels, motels and guest houses share a room with 
at least one other person, the figures in Table 6 give an inflated 
picture of the expected demand for rooms.
<P>
An indication of how many room nights will be sold to cater for visitors' 
needs can be calculated using the ratio of room nights to guest nights 
derived from the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Survey of Tourist 
Accommodation. These figures show that, on average, 1.76 guest nights 
currently translate into one room night. Using this ratio, it can be 
estimated that approximately 18 million room nights will be required in 
2000, 35 per cent of them by visitors from the Other Asia market. 
However, it should be noted that this ratio does not distinguish between 
domestic and international tourists.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Expenditure</B>
<P>
The Bureau of Tourism Research's International Visitor Survey (IVS) 
collects data on spending that is directly related to the Australian 
component of a visitor's trip. The survey includes both visitor spending 
in Australia and spending on packaged tours purchased outside Australia. 
In the following analysis these two components of spending are forecast 
separately. The projections are <B>not</B> intended as forecasts of 
tourism's contribution to the balance of payments.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Visitor spending in Australia</B>
<P>
Real average expenditure per person has varied considerably over the past 
six years, but has generally fallen since 1990 (see Table 7). At the same 
time, real average daily expenditure per person has been rising. 
Available data show that real average daily expenditure per person is 
inversely related to the average duration of stay, so that people on 
shorter holidays tend to spend more per day than people on longer 
holidays. Given that the average duration of stay is likely to continue 
falling, it is expected that this trend of rising expenditure per day 
will continue.<P>
<IMG SRC="Table7p17.GIF" WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=201 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>
The relationship between duration of stay and daily expenditure is more 
evident when the data are broken up into individual source markets. The 
markets that have had the largest decreases in average duration of stay, 
such as Other Asia and Europe, have had the greatest increases in average 
expenditure per day.
<P>
In forecasting expenditure, it has been assumed that this relationship 
will continue and the predicted fall in duration of stay will have a 
positive impact on average daily expenditure. 
<P>
The forecasts also take into account the effect of expected rises in real 
incomes in source countries. In the past, steadily rising real incomes in 
countries such as the United States and Japan have been associated with 
rises in holiday expenditure in real terms. The expected global growth in 
per capita real private expenditure is assumed to have similar effects 
over the forecast period.
<P>
Projections of expenditure have been made based on these assumptions and 
are shown in Tables 8 and 9 and Figure 2.<P>

Although the major components of international visitor expenditure are 
yet to be forecast, 1993 visitor expenditure in Australia provides an 
indication of the major components. Of the $1 787 average expenditure in 
Australia by an international visitor: 35 per cent went on tourism 
shopping; 33 per cent on food, drink and accommodation; 9 per cent on 
transport; and 23 per cent on other costs.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Australian component of prepaid package expenditure</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
IVS data do not separate the Australian component of expenditure on 
inclusive prepaid package tours purchased outside Australia. However, the 
Bureau of Tourism Research has recently calculated the value of this 
expenditure by major source market for the three years 1990 to 1992. 
Owing to limited data it is not possible to determine trends.
<P>
To calculate the value of this expenditure for the years 1994 to 2003, 
two assumptions were made. First, it was assumed that the proportion of 
people travelling on prepaid package tours would remain constant for 
mature markets and increase for the Other Asian markets (from 28 per cent 
in 1993 to 58 per cent in 2003). There is a tendency for first-time 
holiday travellers to prefer to travel on package tours, and a 
significant percentage of travellers from the emerging markets are 
first-time holiday travellers. 
<P>
Second, it was assumed that the average real expenditure per person 
travelling on a prepaid package would remain constant for all major 
markets at an average of the three years 1990 to 1992.
<P>
Based on these assumptions, it was concluded that the annual average 
growth rate in prepaid expenditure would be 12.7 per cent, an increase 
from $700 million in 1993 to $2.4 billion in 2003. However, the forecast 
figure is very sensitive to the assumptions about the Japan and Other 
Asia markets, which make up more than 80 per cent of total prepaid 
expenditure. If there were a greater than expected increase in 
independent travel from Japan, and the percentage of Japanese arrivals 
travelling on prepaid package tours were to fall from 85 per cent to, 
say, 60 per cent, prepaid expenditure would fall by 12 per cent to $2.1 
billion.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Total expenditure <BR>
(direct and prepaid)</B>
<P>
Total expenditure by international tourists from each major market is 
derived by combining the estimates of prepaid expenditure and expenditure 
in Australia as presented earlier. The outcome is shown in Table 10. 
<IMG SRC="Table10p18.GIF" WIDTH=335 HEIGHT=352 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>
As noted earlier, the forecast of visitor expenditure given in Table 10 
does not represent total export earnings from tourism. In addition to the 
components forecast, tourism's contribution to the balance of payments 
includes, among other items, international passenger services provided to 
non-residents by Australian airlines, expenditure of students in 
Australia under Commonwealth aid programs, and a proportion of foreign 
airline expenditure in Australia. Methods for forecasting these items are 
being developed.

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4 ALIGN=Center><P>
<I>Continuing strong economic growth in Australia is expected 
to result in rapid increases in the level of overseas travel by 
Australians. In the next five years, resident departures are 
forecast to rise at an average annual rate of 9 per cent.</I>
<P><IMG SRC="P20.GIF" WIDTH=225 HEIGHT=294 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3

<P>
<B>T</B>he number of Australians travelling overseas, whether for 
business, holidays or other reasons, is increasing, according to the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics. During the 10 years to 1993, this sector 
grew at an average rate of 6.1 per cent a year - exactly half the average 
rate of growth in visitors to Australia during the same period, but much 
higher than the annual 1 per cent growth rate for Australians travelling 
domestically.
<P><IMG SRC="Fig1p20.GIF" WIDTH=164 HEIGHT=188 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=RIGHT>
The growth rate in resident departures increased rapidly in earlier 
years (see Figure 1) - averaging 19 per cent annually from 1965 to 1975 
for example. Visitor arrivals have exceeded resident departures since 
1987, and quite markedly since 1991, when the growth rate for Australians 
travelling overseas slowed. <P>

<P>
Over the next five years, overseas travel by Australians is forecast to 
increase by an average of 9 per cent a year (see Table 1), due largely to 
the expected continuing strength of the Australian economy. Overseas 
travel for all purposes is strongly related to the level of national 
production or income in Australia.<P> 
The economic assumptions used in deriving these forecasts are the same as 
those used in forecasting domestic travel (see <I>Forecast </I>vol. 1, 
no. 1 for details). Over the five years to 1998-99, non-farm gross 
domestic product was assumed to grow by an average 3.6 per cent per annum 
in real terms, and household disposable income by 2.7 per cent per annum.

<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Non-business travel</B>
<P>
In 1993-94 travel for holidays or to visit relatives accounted for 72 per 
cent of overseas travel by Australians. This sector has shown the slowest 
growth in recent years, increasing by only 3.6 per cent between 1990-91 
and 1993-94 overall and actually falling in 1993-94 (see Figure 2). This 
compares with growth rates of 11 per cent in 1988-89 and 15 per cent in 
1989-90. Over the next five years it is forecast to increase at an 
average rate of 8 per cent a year, reaching 2.4 million departures in 
1998-99.
<P>
<IMG SRC="Fig2-4p21.GIF" WIDTH=508 HEIGHT=200 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
Overseas travel for other non-business purposes, including employment and 
education, accounts for about 7 per cent of resident departures. This is 
expected to recover strongly in 1994-95 and to increase by an average 11 
per cent a year until 1998-99 (see Figure 3).
<P>
In total, a 1 per cent increase in household disposable income could be 
expected to lead to a 1.8 per cent increase in non-business travel.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Business-related travel</B>
<P>
Australians travelling overseas on business account for 21 per cent of 
resident departures. About 81 per cent of this travel is for pure 
business purposes, 12 per cent is for travel to conventions and 6 per 
cent relates to people accompanying business travellers.
<P>
This sector is strongly responsive to economic conditions - business 
travel fell with Australia's economic slowdown in 1986-87 and again 
during the 1990-91 recession (see Figure 4). Since 1990-91, however, it 
has increased strongly, at an average annual rate of nearly 9 per cent.
<P>
Over the next five years business travel is forecast to increase by 
nearly 11 per cent a year, although any slowing in economic growth from 
expected rates will reduce this forecast. For example, economic growth at 
1 percentage point a year slower than forecast would reduce the forecast 
rate of growth in business travel by 3 percentage points a year.

<B>Looking short-term with leading indicators</B>
</H1>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4 ALIGN=Center><P>
<I>The growth rate in short-term visitor arrivals appeared to reach a 
cyclical peak in late 1993 and should moderate over the next few years. 
This does not imply that the number of arrivals will decline, but rather 
that it can be expected to grow at a slower rate than in the early 1990s. 
The present recovery in the world economy should lead to an increase in 
the growth rate again in two to three years' time.</I>
<P>
<B>T</B>he trend rate of growth in visitor arrivals to Australia has been 
strongly positive for some time, culminating in an overall increase of 15 
per cent in 1993.  Forecasts point to continuing strong, but more 
moderate growth on average for at least the next decade (see elsewhere in 
this issue of <I>Forecast</I>). There has, however, been substantial 
variation in the rate of growth from year to year, and this variation can 
also be expected to continue.
<P>
For many of the day-to-day decisions made by businesses and governments, 
these variations around the long-term trend are vital. Leading indicator 
analysis is a valuable tool for identifying and predicting these 
shorter-term movements around the trend, providing advance warning of 
turning points between accelerations and decelerations in the growth 
rate.
<P>
Regular publication of the indicators developed for visitor arrivals will 
complement existing forecasts and help to improve the level of 
information on which tourism investment planning and policy decisions are 
made.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Cyclical movements in short-term visitor arrivals</B>
<P>
The number of short-term overseas visitors to Australia has grown from 
fewer than 60 000 in 1957, when official record keeping began, to almost 
3 million in 1993 - an average annual growth rate of 11.6 per cent.
<P>
Cyclical movements in visitor arrivals are movements around the long-term 
trend. An acceleration occurs when the growth rate is above the 
underlying long-term trend, and a deceleration when it is below. Thus, an 
observed trough or deceleration in the series does not necessarily 
represent a decline in the number of international visitors to Australia. 

<P>
<IMG SRC="Fig1p23.GIF" WIDTH=329 HEIGHT=166 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>
Since 1969 there have been 10 confirmed cyclical turning points in the 
visitor arrival series (five peaks and five troughs) and a recent peak in 
the September quarter of 1993 (see Figure 1). There are also four 
'double-turns'- that is, fluctuations in the rate of growth that are not 
large enough to be classified as genuine peaks or troughs.<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Table1p23.GIF" WIDTH=326 HEIGHT=186 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>The average duration of the completed cycles is 17.8 quarters (see 
Table 1), with the average duration of decelerations (9 quarters) being 
slightly longer than the average duration of accelerations (7.5 
quarters). The most recently confirmed cyclical turning point was a 
trough in the growth rate during the September quarter 1989. The 
accelerating growth period since then has been much longer than the 
average duration of acceleration of 7.5 quarters.  A small cyclical 
deceleration has been recorded since the December quarter 1993, and it is 
possible that a peak in cyclical visitor arrivals occurred in the 
September quarter of 1993.<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Selection of leading indicators</B>
<P>
There are many potential leading indicators of visitor arrivals and a 
number were assessed for suitability.
<P>
Three leading indicators - OECD Gross Domestic Product (OECD-GDP), OECD 
Unemployment (OECD-Unemp) and the Australian Trade Weighted Index 
(AUS-TWI) - were selected from these series. Each of these series 
consistently provided advance warning of past changes in the rate of 
growth in visitor arrivals around the long-term trend.
<P>
<IMG SRC="Table2p23.GIF" WIDTH=329 HEIGHT=167 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>Australian Visitor Visa Issuances (AUS-VISAS) were identified as a 
coincidental indicator. (This means that quarterly movements in visa 
issuances tend not to give any advance warning of movements in arrivals, 
but rather move in the same way at the same time as arrivals.) 
<P>
A long lead length and low variability are two key properties for a 
leading indicator. OECD-GDP has the longest lead to the visitor arrival 
cyclical turning points, ranging from 10 to 12 quarters (see Table 2). 
This is followed by OECD-Unemp with leads of 9 to 12 quarters. AUS-TWI 
has shorter leads at 3 to 7 quarters.<P>

ALIGN=LEFT>The OECD-GDP series, with its mean lead length of 11 quarters 
and a range of two quarters, therefore provides the best leading 
indicator for short-term overseas visitor arrivals (see Figure 2), with 
OECD-Unemp running a close second.

<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
The leading indicators identified can be used to provide between one and 
three years' advance warning of movements in cyclical activity in visitor 
arrivals. They are not designed to predict the actual levels of arrivals. 
That is the domain of forecasting. However, they provide a better 
indication of short-term prospects for the direction in the rate of 
growth. 
<P>
Leading indicators suggest that the rate of growth in arrivals peaked in 
late 1993, and can now be expected to moderate.  However, given that OECD 
economic growth is now increasing again following the downturn of the 
late 1980s and early 1990s, leading indicator analysis suggests that 
growth in visitor arrivals should increase again in two to three years' 
time.
<P>
The approach described in this report for constructing leading indicators 
for short-term visitor arrivals can be applied to other areas of tourism. 
Extending the analysis to arrivals from individual countries and to 
measures of domestic tourism activity are desirable next steps. Given the 
prospects for increased tourism from non-OECD Asia, investigating the use 
of leading indicators covering more than just OECD economic conditions is 
also desirable.<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4 ALIGN=Center><P>
<H2>
<B>What are leading indicators?</B>
</H2>
<P>
Leading indicators provide advance warning of short-term changes or 
turning points in growth rates.
<P>
Although they have not been used previously to predict tourism activity 
in Australia, they are commonly used in the economic arena. For example, 
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) publishes a leading indicator 
of the Australian business cycle, and leading indicators of overall 
economic activity are published for member countries of the Organisation 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
<P>
Leading indicators differ from, and complement, traditional forecasts. A 
forecast of short-term inbound tourism would predict actual numbers of 
visitor arrivals. Leading indicators, on the other hand, would predict 
turning points or long-term changes in the growth rate of visitor 
arrivals, rather than actual numbers. They are typically quicker and 
simpler to update than forecasts.
<P>
In developing leading indicators, underlying patterns in visitor 
arrivals were identified. While the long-term trend is upwards, there is 
substantial variation around that trend - periods when the rate of growth 
is above the trend and periods when it is below. 
<P>
Leading indicator analysis identifies these differences and warns of 
changes in the direction of these differences. It involves establishing a 
historical link between the cyclical movements in visitor arrivals and 
one or more of the indicator series. Cyclical series are derived from raw 
data by removing seasonal fluctuations and irregularities from one-off 
events.
<P>
A more complete description of the work involved will be published by the 
Bureau of Tourism Research as Occasional Paper 19, <I>Leading Indicators 
of International Visitor Arrivals</I>.

<H1><B>ACCOMMODATION</B></H1>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<H2><B>An encouraging but patchy recovery for hotels and motels</B></H2>
<P>
<I>Nationally, the tourist accommodation industry has recovered from the 
recession more quickly than the economy as a whole. The recovery in the 
hotel and motel sector, however, has not been evenly distributed across 
States, with continuing evidence of difficulties faced by owners in some 
regions due to an oversupply of accommodation. Recent changes in hotel 
activity across the States highlight the need for careful analysis of 
local conditions when planning an investment.</I><P>
<P><IMG SRC="P24.GIF" WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=236 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT><P>
<B>H</B>otels and motels receive approximately 80 per cent of the total 
takings in the commercial tourist accommodation industry. Other forms of 
commercial tourist accommodation servicing the needs of holiday makers, 
business people and other tourists include holiday flats and units, 
serviced apartments and caravan parks. <IMG SRC="Fig1p25.GIF" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=205 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=RIGHT>
In some regional tourist markets, such as the Gold Coast, holiday flats and units are an important competitor to hotel and motel accommodation. Similarly, the recent construction of serviced apartments is adding to competition for 
inner-city hotels. 
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS)   September quarter 1994 
Survey of Tourist Accommodation data showed that revenue in the hotel and 
motel sector continued to grow strongly (see Table 1 and Figure 1). Hotel 
and motel room nights sold and takings both rose significantly over the 
past year, and the national annual average occupancy rate was the highest 
since 1988-89.<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="Table1p25.GIF" WIDTH=337 HEIGHT=188 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
Recently, changes in national hotel and motel average room rates have 
followed changes in occupancy rates after a lag. 
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="Fig2p25.GIF" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=206 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT><P>Despite these indications of a continuing recovery, low 
levels of profitability in the industry since the late 1980s have 
discouraged investment in new facilities.  As illustrated in Figure 2, 
the value of commencements and work done on hotels has fallen by around 
80 per cent since 1989.

<P>
There is a need to plan for the construction of large new hotels three to 
four years in advance of opening to allow time for design, approvals, 
arrangement of finance, construction and fit-out. This long lead time 
increases the interest of hoteliers in fore-casting. On the basis of the 
current low levels of hotel commencements, only very limited additions to 
hotel supply are anticipated before late 1996.
<P>
When contemplating an investment in tourist accommodation, however, it is 
insufficient to focus only on forecasts of occupancy rates and average 
room rates at a national level. The recent significant variation between 
States and Territories further suggests that more disaggregated forecasts 
of these variables are required for investment planning.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>State profiles</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="Table2p25.GIF" WIDTH=335 HEIGHT=245 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3  ALIGN=LEFT>Table 2 illustrates the recent disparity in measures 
of activity for the accommodation industry across States. For example, 
over the past 12 months, the growth in takings varied across States from 
6 per cent to 14 per cent.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="Table3p26.GIF" WIDTH=336 HEIGHT=137 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3  ALIGN=LEFT>
These variations between States are not just a feature of the past 12 
months but have occurred consistently over the past three years.  As can 
be seen in Table 3, growth in room nights sold in the Australian Capital 
Territory, Queensland and the Northern Territory outperformed the 
national average; growth in Tasmania, New South Wales and Western 
Australia was at, or only slightly below, the national average; but South 
Australia and Victoria recovered from the recession more slowly.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="Fig3p25.GIF" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=225 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3  
ALIGN=LEFT>Not surprisingly, in a period of limited construction of new 
accommodation, the varying growth rates in room nights sold have had a 
major influence on the ranking of the States in terms of current 
occupancy rates.
<P>
In Victoria and South Australia there has been only a modest recent 
improvement in occupancy rates, which have remained well below historical 
levels for the past four years (Figure 3).  The effect of these 
consistently low occupancy rates has had an impact on rooms available in 
South Australia and room rates in Victoria (Table 4).  <P>
<IMG SRC="Table4p26.GIF" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=180 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>

The recent experience of Victoria and South Australia suggests that rooms 
are not readily removed from supply even in periods of low demand. If low 
levels of activity extend over a sufficiently long time, however, a large 
contraction in supply might eventually be expected.  It also appears that 
the more rooms that are removed from supply, the less room discounting 
might be expected.
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="Fig4p25.GIF" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=207 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT>

By comparison, average annual occupancy rates in New South Wales, 
Tasmania and Western Australia have improved more dramatically over the 
past two years (Figure 4).  However, in the early 1990s occupancy rates 
in these States fell to the lowest levels recorded since the series began 
in 1976 and are only just recovering to pre-recession levels.
<P>
<IMG SRC="Table5p26.GIF" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=177 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>In Western Australia and New South Wales a recovery 
in operator returns has been aided by small falls in the room stock over 
the past two years.  Western Australia, with the largest fall in room 
stock of these three States, had the best recovery in average room rates; 
while Tasmania, with a relatively large addition to the room stock, had 
the largest fall in average room rates (Table 5).
<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="Fig5p25.GIF" WIDTH=162 HEIGHT=211 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=3 
ALIGN=LEFT>
Queensland, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory 
had an earlier and more significant improvement in occupancy rates than 
the other States. Queensland has surpassed the highest average annual 
occupancy rates achieved in the 1980s (Figure 5).
<P>
<IMG SRC="Table6p26.GIF" WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=194 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 
BORDER=3 ALIGN=LEFT>
The Northern Territory showed the largest increase in room supply and 
high growth in room nights sold, yet had a decline in real room rates 
(Table 6).<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIze=4 ALIGN=Centre><P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
The historically low level of investment in new accommodation facilities 
over the past two years suggests the industry was hit hard by the 
recession. As investment is normally driven by expectations of profitable 
operation, a low level of investment suggests poor profit expectations in 
recent years, although data on profitability are not generally available.

<P>
At a national level, the recovery in takings has recently outpaced growth 
in the economy. Occupancy rates are back to 1988-89 levels and real room 
rates are now rising. This recovery is in large part due to an increase 
in demand.  
<P>
In States where demand has grown relatively slowly and the recovery has 
come later, data on occupancy rates and average room rates suggest that 
owners are still struggling to get a return on their investment (although 
there are likely to be wide variations in the profitability of individual 
establishments). 
<P>
Both room supply and real room rates did not undergo large declines 
during the recent recession and most of the adjustment during this period 
focused on occupancy rates, which fell significantly. Since the beginning 
of the recovery in 1992, adjustment has again been focused on occupancy 
rates. It is expected that only when occupancy rates reach high levels, 
as is occurring in various regional markets including Cairns, that real 
room rate increases will follow, at least until new capacity is built.

Indigenous tourism is an integral and growing part of the Australian 
tourism experience. It is a uniquely Australian product and provides a 
richly diverse attraction for both Australian and international 
tourists.<P>

This booklet showcases a selection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander individuals, communities and companies that have achieved 
success in the tourism industry in their own right. Eleven successful 
indigenous tourism operations are profiled. They illustrate some of the 
different ways indigenous people are participating in the tourism 
industry: from selling their artwork and designs to a dealer (and thus 
having limited contact with tourists) to working directly with the 
tourist; and from owning and operating a tourist attraction to hosting 
tourists on cultural tours.<P>

Getting a tourism business up and running is, however, only part of the 
story. The other part - maintaining and building the business for the 
longer term - is more challenging. Meeting the challenge requires 
effective marketing and promotion, good management and a commitment to 
quality service.<P>

Involvement in tourism, in both the mainstream industry and indigenous 
enterprise contexts, can contribute to self-determination, 
self-management and economic self-sufficiency. It can also make a 
contribution to the process of reconciliation.
<P>


There are many organisations that can help indigenous Australians along 
the path to success in tourism. Some of these are listed at the back of 
this publication.<P>

I am particularly pleased to have had these profiles prepared during the 
International Year of the World's Indigenous People. I hope they serve as 
an inspiration to all Australians, particularly indigenous Australians.

Interest in indigenous tourism is increasing on both sides of the 
counter. Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are embracing 
opportunities in the tourism industry and tourists are becoming more 
interested in experiencing and understanding Australia's indigenous 
culture. <P>

Tourism was one of three industries identified in the Commonwealth 
Government's response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into 
Aboriginal Deaths in Custody as offering opportunities for greater 
participation by indigenous people. As a consequence, the Government has 
initiated the development of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander Tourism Strategy to enhance opportunities for 
self-determination, self-management and economic self-sufficiency in 
tourism for indigenous Australians.<P>
<IMG WIDTH=236 HEIGHT=217 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIF/Turtle.GIF"><P>


Indigenous people are attracted to the tourism industry for many 
different reasons. Although a primary reason may be to earn money, 
economic gain is not the only benefit that involvement in tourism can 
bring to indigenous communities. Tourism ventures can heighten interest 
in and help to sustain a community's culture and play an important role 
in reconciliation by helping non-indigenous people to understand and 
appreciate indigenous cultures and values. <P>

This booklet aims to increase awareness in Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander communities of the opportunities available to them through 
involvement in the tourism industry. It also aims to demonstrate to the 
tourism industry and the Australian community that the number of 
internationally competitive Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tourism 
enterprises is increasing.<P>

A Talent for Tourism - Bangarra Dance Theatre
</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY  BACKGROUND="/images/jpg/chalk.jpg"> 
<CENTER><IMG WIDTH=386 HEIGHT=159  SRC="GIF/Bangarra.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>


<FONT SIZE=4><B>by Bill Gray</B></FONT>
<P>
<I><B>Bangarra Dance Theatre is a professional contemporary dance company 
employing 23 people (21indigenous). It targets the domestic market but is 
looking to Asia, the US and UK. Bangarra is working towards having its 
own theatre/cultural centre by 1995.</B></I><P>

<P>
When Bangarra Dance Theatre officially launched itself on the national 
stage, the ceremony took place in the executive suite of the Arthur 
Andersen building overlooking Sydney Harbour.<P>

After the champagne and fancy words, it was literally back to earth for 
the new dance company at its studio in a now-demolished building in 
central Sydney.
<P>
<B><I>"The unique thing about Praying Mantis Dreaming is that it was 
totally conceived, scored and performed by Aboriginals and Torres Strait 
Islanders."</I></B><P>
Former dancer Cheryl Stone, who is still with the company, recalls: `We 
relied on school performances to make a living, dashing half-dressed in 
ochre from one performance to the next. We shared everything and became 
like a family surviving on a very basic salary'.
<P>
Bangarra has not only survived, it has established itself as a successful 
indigenous dance company.
<P>
The studio is still shared (these days with a police youth club) and the 
administration is done out of a dedicated, if cramped, office in 
inner-city Redfern. The company believes it is a year away from a complex 
of its own and a second troupe.
<P>
General Manager Rob Bryant puts the transition down to talent, 
dedication, hard work and the ability to find regular funding sources.
<P>
Bangarra (Wiradjuri word for `making fire') evolved out of the Aboriginal 
Islander Dance Theatre, part of the National Aboriginal Islander Skills 
Development Association set up by Carole Johnson, a black American, after 
she arrived from New York in the early seventies.
<P>
<I><B>Caption: Bangarra blends the best of traditional Aboriginal and 
Torres <BR>
Strait Islander dance and contemporary dance</B></I>
<IMG WIDTH=395 HEIGHT=254 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT6.GIF"><BR CLEAR=ALL>
Early inspiration came from visiting black dance groups and the enormous 
success being achieved by Graeme Murphy's Sydney Dance Company. The 
decision to form an independent company followed a sharp rise in 
community interest in Aboriginal culture during the 1988 Bicentennial 
celebrations.
<P>
Cheryl recalls that the time `just seemed right' to form an indigenous 
company able to blend the best of traditional Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander dance and contemporary dance.
<P>
Six graduates of the Aboriginal Islander Dance Theatre - Sylvia Blanco, 
Monica Stevens, Jasmin Gulash, Jimmy Gagai, Percy Jackonia and Richard 
Talonga - took up the challenge with enthusiasm, supported by Cheryl as 
Administrator and Carole, who provided development support.
<P>
Cheryl said the group separated from the Aboriginal Islander Dance 
Theatre to establish their own identity and financial base. Money was in 
short supply from the outset.
<P>
<I><B>Caption: Bangarra dancers as they appear in the Australian Tourist 
<BR>Commission's convention and incentive film Unconventional 
Australia</B></I>
<IMG WIDTH=396 HEIGHT=218 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT7.GIF"><BR CLEAR=ALL>
`We soon attracted some corporatesponsors - two of them, Arthur Andersen 
and the AAP Group, are still with us - but the support was mainly in 
kind', Cheryl says.
<P>
Rob became General Manager in 1990 after completing a Bachelor of 
Business degree at Sydney's then Kuringai College of Advanced Education. 
An Aboriginal from the NSW north coast, his administrative skills proved 
invaluable in piecing together a strategy that would secure funding and 
build up an effective support structure for the performers.
<P>
Bangarra's first big break came in 1991 with a creative development grant 
from the Australia Council.
<P>
`From memory it was about $26 000, but it enabled us to hire our first 
artistic director and get away from the schools long enough to start 
developing a new creative direction', Rob recalls.
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=323 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIF/Man.GIF"><P>
The new artistic director was Stephen Page, a young Aboriginal who became 
a lead dancer with the Sydney Dance Company after graduating from the 
National Aboriginal Islander Skills Development Association in 1983.
<P>
Cheryl believes this was the turning point. `Up to that point our 
creative directors had been black Americans. Some of us were convinced 
that we needed an Aboriginal in the role, and Stephen has proved that 
right many times over.'
<P>
Stephen's creative skills have expanded Bangarra's horizons well beyond 
Australia, with tours to China, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and the 
United States. The company's first full ballet, Praying Mantis Dreaming, 
which has completed a two-week season in Sydney, is scheduled to tour 
Darwin, Alice Springs and Mt Isa in mid-1994.
<P>
<I><B>"Unfortunately, too many people shink that if they get an artist or 
artists they have a show. That's not the case. There must be proper 
technical and management support to deliver a professional 
result"</B></I><P>
`The unique thing about Praying Mantis Dreaming is that it was totally 
conceived, scored and performed by Aboriginals and Torres Strait 
Islanders', Cheryl says. `Full credit for that must go to the talent and 
discipline Stephen has brought to the company.'
<P>
Bangarra's success has also extended to performances at the Australian 
Football League grand final in Melbourne and the World Youth Soccer Cup 
in Sydney, and the recently released opera film Black River. It is about 
to start work on another full production - `Hostels' (working title) - 
and has been invited to appear at both the Adelaide Arts and Melbourne 
International Arts festivals in 1994.
<P>
School performances are still given high priority because of the need to 
promote understanding and acceptance of Australia's indigenous cultures. 
They also remain an important income source.
<P>
Government agencies have supported Bangarra during the development phase, 
particularly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission 
(ATSIC), the Australia Council (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Arts Unit and Performing Arts Board), the Department of Employment, 
Education and Training and the NSW Ministry for the Arts. The Department 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided valuable support for the 
overseas tours.
<P>
`We have a unique product, and this has assisted us in lobbying various 
government departments', Rob says.
<P>
From six dancers and two administrators in 1989, Bangarra has grown to 15 
dancers, five administrative staff and three production personnel. All 
the dancers and all but two of the support staff are Aboriginals or 
Torres Strait Islanders. Similarly, Bangarra's Board is made up mainly of 
indigenous people and draws on a wide range of professional and business 
skills. 
<P>
Rob and Carole believe there are many lessons for indigenous groups 
wanting to establish themselves in the performing arts.</P><P></P><P>`You 
have to know your product, know your audience, know how to put together a 
professional production and be as self-contained as possible', Rob says.
<P>
`Aim to spread the revenue base, with earned income, membership 
development and merchandising accounting for, say, 60 per cent and the 
rest coming from corporate sponsors and other sources.'
<P>
Carole lists the right ingredients as `a good product and infrastructure, 
lots of energy and enthusiasm, a high degree of professionalism and 
strong management to make it all happen.
<P>
`The show must go on. Unfortunately, too many people think that if they 
get an artist or artists they have a show. That's not the case. There 
must be proper technical and management support to deliver a professional

<B><I>Brambuk Living Cultural Centre was established by the five Koori 
communities of south-western Victoria. It has six full-time staff (five 
indigenous) and up to 20 part-time employees (the majority indigenous). 
Visitors are mainly domestic with an increasing international 
component.</I></B><P>
<P>


The Brambuk Living Cultural Centre brings back to life an almost 
forgotten culture that belongs to the Aboriginal people of south-west 
Victoria, who for morethan 5 000 years have called the majestic Gariwerd 
(the Grampians) mountain range their home.<P>

The Centre, which offers cultural exhibits and activities and an 
Aboriginal restaurant, attracts about 100 000 visitors per year - 
approximately 10 000 of them international tourists. <P>
<I><B>Caption: The Brambuk Living Cultural Centre: superbly <BR>

<IMG WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=420 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT9.GIF"><P>
Brambuk opened in October 1991 after 10 years of planning and 
consultation between the region's Aboriginal communities: the Framlingham 
Aboriginal Trust, the Goolum Goolum Aboriginal Co-operative (Horsham), 
the Gunditjamara Aboriginal Co-operative (Warrnambool), the Kerrup-Jmara 
Aboriginal Elders Co-operative (Lake Condah) and the Portland, Hamilton 
and Heywood Communities.<P>

Their aims were to raise awareness of Aboriginal culture while creating 
employment and generating income for the local community. Brambuk has 
successfully met these goals and is planning to achieve self-sufficiency 
within the next few years.
<P>
Brambuk's visual and audio exhibits graphically bring to life the period 
of Aboriginal history from the days before white colonisation to the 
present, including Aboriginal tools, weapons, art and photographs that 
date back to the beginning of the century.<P>

For the more adventurous there is a large selection of outdoor 
activities. Visitors can accompany one of the cultural officers on a 
short trip into the surrounding bush to taste one of the thousands of 
varieties of fruit, nuts or berries growing in the swamps and marshes or 
listen to the haunting sound of the didgeridoo. Boomerang throwing is 
also popular.<P>
<I><B>"We have to constantly change our schedule of activities to cope 
with seasonal changes--the time of the year plays a big part in what 
program we run"</B></I><P>


The most unique aspect of the centre is the Gugijela Restaurant, serving 
authentic traditional Aboriginal food, including game, seafood and 
vegetables, all prepared in traditional ways but blended with European 
style sauces and seasoning to appeal to all palates.<P>

Tim Chatfield, Brambuk's Senior Cultural Officer, says the original idea 
of the restaurant was to allow people to taste traditional Aboriginal 
food in a setting that would make the experience memorable. <P>

`The main problem was a lot of the food has a strong and gamy flavour 
which doesn't agree with most people's palates', Tim says. <P>

`A compromise was reached by incorporating a number of different European 
style sauces in the preparation.' This formula proved successful as the 
restaurant is now totally self-funding. <P>

According to Tim, the Centre runs at approximately 85 per cent 
self-sufficiency, the other 15 per cent coming from various outside 
organisations to fund cultural tours and similar projects. <P>
<I><B>Caption: Visitors learn about Aboriginal history and <BR>
culture through Brambuk's visual and audio exhibits.</B></I><IMG 
WIDTH=510 HEIGHT=335 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT.GIF"><BR CLEAR=ALL>
`Presently the gift shop generates enough income to be able to restock 
itself and cover wages, while the entrance fee covers most of the 
administration costs. <P>

`We have a variety of charges for activities conducted within the Centre 
and tours around the park; these fees were calculated by working out the 
approximate time of each session along with staff wages and vehicle 
maintenance.<P>

`Most of the major decisions on cultural projects and finance are made by 
a committee of management.' <P>

Tim has been with Brambuk since its inception. After funding for the 
project was approved by the Federal and Victorian Governments, a 
consultant was engaged to prepare a business plan for the Centre.
<P>
`The market analysis included in the Business Plan confirmed the belief 
that visitors preferred an interactive or hands-on experience and that 
tourist interest in Aboriginal culture reached across Australia and 
extended overseas', Tim says.<P>
<IMG WIDTH=295 HEIGHT=121 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIF/Fish.GIF"><P>
`We have to constantly change our schedule of activities to cope with 
seasonal changes--the time of the year plays a big part in what programs 
we run. 
<P>


`We find traditional holidays such as Christmas and Easter are the most 
hectic but school holidays and the October wildflower festival come a 
close second.'<P>

Education has been the major focus of Brambuk and to meet the increasing 
demand from primary and secondary schools the Centre is working with 
outside training organisations to set up programs to assist more 
Aboriginals to enter the tourism industry.<P>



The centre employs up to 26 staff, 19 from the Aboriginal community, with 
an emphasis on multiskilling. Some staff are employed under formal 
apprenticeship arrangements, including a chef, landscape gardener and 
retail trainees.<P>
<I><B>Caption: Brambuk activities provide interactive and hands-on

<IMG WIDTH=477 HEIGHT=301 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT10.GIF"><P>
Tour guides are chosen and trained for expertise in understanding and 
interpreting the natural  environment, the Aboriginal relationship with 
the land, animals, birds and plants, and the influence of the environment 
in Aboriginal beliefs and culture.<P>

Brambuk is an active member of the Stawell and Grampian Development 
Association, forming an important link between the Aboriginal community 
and the established tourism enterprises of the region.<P>
<I><B>The market analysis... confirmed the belief that visitors preferred 
an interactive or hands-on experience and that tourists interest in 
Aboriginal culture reached across Australia and extended 
overseas"<P></B></I>


Brambuk has hosted many Australian and international media 
representatives and has received considerable exposure at Australian 
Tourism Exchange and international trade shows. The Centre was the focal 
point for Tourism Victoria's major Gariwerd/Grampians Promotional 
Campaign.<P>

The Centre's site in Halls Gap, in the Grampians National Park, was 
chosen for a number of reasons, particularly its proximity to Aboriginal 
sacred sites. <P>

The Cultural Centre itself is housed in a striking building that is both 
authentically Aboriginal and in harmony with the surrounding 
environment.<P>

The undulating, two-toned, corrugated iron roof represents the features 
of the local cockatoo, while the curving ramp through the centre 
represents an eel, once a staple food in the region.<P>

The landscape was designed to incorporate the thousands of indigenous 
species, all related to the Grampians ecosystem, while taking into 
account the growing and harvesting of bush tucker and medicinal plants, 
which in turn interpret the Aboriginal association with the land.<P>

<P>
<I><B>Camp Coorong cultural tourism and

education centre employs two indigenous people. It is moving from an

original focus on the education sector towards mainstream tourism,

including ecotourism.</B></I><P>

'We're not doing this to get

rich--we're doing it to help solve a problem.<P>

'According

to Tom and George Trevorrow, co-managers of Camp Coorong, this is the

philosophy behind their cultural tourism venture.<P>

<I><B>Camp

Coorong aims for a true reconciliation and greater understanding between

two rich cultures</B></I><P>

Camp

Coorong aims for a true reconciliation and greater understanding between

two rich cultures<--presented as a two or three day study tour of an

ecologically and historically significant area. Schools use the facility

as a valuable teaching resource for their Aboriginal studies courses.
<P>


The Coorong National Park, 200 kilometres south-east of

Adelaide, is a 145-kilometre long coastal reserve where the Murray River

empties into the sea. It is one of the world's most important

sanctuaries--as a breeding site for seabirds, especially pelican, and

for the ancient history that lies buried along the dunes.<P>

The

Ngarrindjeri people have had a link with this land for at least 20 000

years and the remains of their camps are still visible.<P>

George

began organising tent camps for schools in the area when he was regional

adviser in Aboriginal education for the Education Department but his

dream was for a permanent cultural centre.<P>

His dream was

realised in 1987 when, after several months' preparation of a run-down

farm site by the local Ngarrindjeri community, the Ngarrindjeri Lands

and Progress Association was given clearance to purchase the land and

build a toilet and shower block.<P>


The Camp Coorong Race

Relations and Cultural Education Centre began to take shape, with

further grants from government agencies to build two bunkhouses, a

kitchen and offices. Today, the site still survives primarily on

voluntary labour, with George and Tom--a trained Parks &amp; Wildlife

ranger--the only two employees.<P>

Operating costs are

funded through ATSIC and running costs are partly covered by the

relatively small camping fees paid by school groups.<P>

Important

secondary aims are also being realised: to create employment

opportunities for the Ngarrindjeri community and to encourage its

younger members to learn their culture and traditional skills.<P

>Under a Government program--the Community Development Employment

Projects Scheme--24 Ngarrindjeri are working as cleaners, cooks and

gardeners, while others are being trained in farm work, using heavy

machinery, building and environmental management, office practice and

tour guide work. The Ngarrindjeri Lands and Progress Association hopes

soon to be able to put these people into full-time employment.<P>
The community followed a hands-on system of teaching before it became

fashionable. Tour groups try their hand at activities like food

gathering and weaving.<P>

Children are told the creation

story of the Murray River and are taken on bushwalks to discover local

wildlife, traditional medicine and food plants and the old community

burial sites and shell middens of their camps.<P>

`They can

understand that these environments should not be damaged further',

George says, `and that if a four-wheel drive goes straight over an

ancient site or breaks down the dunes it's not just an Aboriginal issue

but an Australian issue. <P>

`There's 5 to 6 thousand years

of history and information in those middens on the Younghusband

Peninsula.<P>
<IMG WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=231 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIF/Woman.GIF"><P>
'While South Australian school groups make up

the majority, other visitors include interstate and overseas tour groups

(with Swedes, Finns and Britons featuring strongly), university

students, government conferences and even Chinese

archaeologists--fascinated by the remains of a well built by their

countrymen who passed through the area en route to the goldfields.
<P>


The 40-bed facility also caters for casual visitors, with three

self-contained cabins and the option of taking bushwalks and guided

tours.<P>

The ingredients for an ecotourism program are here

but Tom feels another dormitory block, a four-wheel-drive bus and a boat

are needed before the expected groups from the United States,

conventions and bigger school groups can be properly catered for. More

lobbying lies ahead.<P>

`We really need two full-time

understudies to learn the cultural teaching from us, plus full-time

employees to keep a place like this running properly', George says.
<P>


It's the stories of struggle and success--and the many

tips--that bring other Aboriginal groups to Camp Coorong. What advice do

Tom and George offer?<P>

`You've got to know your country

and believe in what you do, because otherwise it'll never happen',

George says. `The only reason this has kept going is because we set our

goals a long time ago and set a vision to begin a process of

reconciliation and to teach the true cultural history of our area.'
<P>


Truth is a vital ingredient for success according to the

brothers, who have seen other groups encouraged by some tour companies

to embellish or invent Dreamtime stories. Their credibility subsequently

disappears.<P>

`You also have to put up with a lot of

rubbish along the way from all sorts of people, even your own', George

says.<P>

Decision-making and management is a cooperative

affair, with the community running Camp Coorong through a seven-member

committee and referring all major issues back to the whole community

(around 100 in the immediate Meningie town area).<P>

`When

we first came up with the ideas, nobody wanted to touch us _ it took

quite a while before we were recognised by our own Aboriginal

departments.<P>

`Then after we'd got the land ready, the

departments wanted to come in and pour the money in and put the place up

straight away and we said they shouldn't do it that way.<P>

`We

said we had to develop Camp Coorong by developing ourselves first, so as

the place started to grow, we began to grow in understanding and

knowledge of how to operate and manage it, how to handle people and talk

to people--and discover what people really want to know.<P>

`We're

only just starting to get into marketing plans. We never even

advertised--we said the best form was word of mouth which has really

happened.<P>
<I><B>"We don't put a value on the dollar-- we put education and love and 
understanding first, and I suppose that's what may make us different 
compared with other businesses"</B></I><P>
`Now we're looking to the business side, ATSIC

is going to make people available to help us develop our business

development plan. At this stage, our turnover cannot make us

self-supporting.<P>

'It's the positive feedback from the

groups that keeps Tom and George going.<P>

`When you get the

notes from schoolkids with their little drawings of the Camp, it makes

you feel good', Tom says.<P>

`We've been told by outside

people "put your prices up" but why should we deprive children of

education on Aboriginal culture? As parents, we know how expensive it is

to send our kids on camps. <P>

`We don't put a value on the

dollar--we put education and love and understanding first, and I suppose

that's what may make us different compared with other businesses.'<P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>by Diana James</B></FONT><P><I><B>Desert Tracks is an 
educational

ecotour teaching Aboriginal law, culture and lifestyle. It is owned by

an Aboriginal council and employs a manager and 20 casual staff (all

indigenous apart from the manager).</B></I><P>

Nganyinytja is the

elder custodian of Angatja, her father's and grandfather's country.

Angatja is an area near the Northern Territory - South Australia border,

part of the Pitjantjatjara Freehold Title Lands of South Australia.<P>



In 1988 Nganyinytja and her family invited some non-Aboriginal

friends to form a joint tour business with them. The business, Desert

Tracks, was formed with Nganyinytja and family providing the

destination, itinerary and traditional teaching, while their partners

raised the finance for vehicles, swags, equipment, marketing, booking

office and staffing.<P>

`Palya. Ngalya pitjala, nyawa

ngayuku ngura. Welcome. Come and visit my country', is Nganyinytja's

invitation.<P>

`If people wish to come and learn our way,

they can come on a trip to my homeland, Angatja. My family runs a bush

college teaching our law and lifestyle. <P>

`Many people are

ignorant of our way, wanting to learn. Office workers, teachers,

doctors, nurses, Aboriginal people from the cities come to learn--those

whose land and culture have been taken away from them.<P>

`Now

lots of people, black and white, are wanting to learn about the old law,

from our grandfathers and grandmothers. <P>

`We are happy to

share our way and pleased that they are taking back this new knowledge

to their homes--and teaching others. We need to keep the cultures

strong, need the two laws to work together.<P>

`People need

to understand that Aboriginal Law/Tjukurpa is in the land. We live on

the land and are keeping it alive, looking after it as our grandmothers

and grandfathers did, following the law.<P>

'Nganyinytja

says the business has been operating, white and black together, for six

years. It has not been an easy road financially.<P>

`It is

hard when not many people come on a tour or a group cancels. Income is

not constant or secure.<P>

' Nganyinytja's family from

Angatja had to convince the Regional Council, Anangu Pitjantjatjara,

that it was a good idea to have tourism on the Pitjantjatjara Lands, as

it provides the permits.<P>

`We are the first group to try

and look after tourists, making sure they do not go into sacred sites or

photograph things they shouldn't.<P><IMG WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=238 ALIGN=RIGHT 
SRC="GIF/Emu.GIF"><P>


`We have to work hard

looking after these city people who don't know how to live in the bush

and don't know our law. If any tourist broke our law then the tour

business would finish, no more permits from Anangu Pitjantjatjara.
<P>


`We have worked through our problems together by talking at

meetings and asking observers from the Council to come on our trips.'
<P>


Desert Tracks has obtained government assistance for physical

works projects around the tourist camps. Water is now piped to the tour

camp and a toilet has been built.<P>

Recently, finance was

secured from ATSIC to buy the joint venture partners' share of the

business. A company has been formed with all the elders on the Board of

Directors. <P>

`We employ a manager and we hope to train our

young people in running the business', Nganyinytja says.<P>

<I><B>"Much trouble has to come from people forgetting the land, the 
spirit. Many people are sick and have lost their spirit. But we can all 
learn and make our spirit strong"</B></I><P>
They

can be trained as guides, interpreters, drivers, cooks and office staff.

We want this business to be there for our grandchildren, so they can

look after this country and have a job out here.<P>

`This

business keeps alive our law and culture, and can provide skilled work

for our families.<P>

'Training to be a cross-cultural

interpreter is hard. They must speak two languages and understand

cultural differences between polite and impolite questioning, taboo

subjects and sensitive issues, as well as having good general knowledge

of the environment and culture to answer people's questions.
<P>


Manager Diana James runs the office, bookings, finances, vehicles and

equipment. She employs casual staff for trips and arranges payment to

Aboriginal guides, teachers and dancers. The number of tourists on a

trip determines how many guides and dancers can be paid to work.<P>

Desert Tracks is a seasonal business. It closes from December to

February, which is a ceremonial time for the Angatja people.
<P>


A business of this type requires vision and dedication; it may not make

money for up to five years.<P>

Desert Tracks charges around

$1 825 for an eight-day tour that takes in Uluru National Park and the

Angatja Bush College. The company offers a discount for groups and for

direct bookings.<P>

A limit of 200 people a year--ten groups

of 20 people--has been set for the tour. One to two groups a month

enables the business to break even.<P>

Desert Tracks is

promoted as a cross-cultural educational ecotour. The company advertises

through the Northern Territory `Come Share Our Culture' campaign and to

specialist cultural and environmental groups through magazines and

radio. Many organisations come back every year, often advertising among

their members.<P>

`Carefully controlled ecotourism has been

good for my family and my place Angatja', Nganyinytja says.

`It has brought many people from all over the world to share our culture

with us. I am pleased that it is growing and some other homeland

families want to have tourism.<P>
<I><B>"This business keeps alive our law and culture, and can provide 
skilled work for our families."</B></I><P>
`We will help them set up

their camps, plan their itineraries and make sure everything they show

and tell about is not secret but open to men, women and children.<P>

`They will have to get permission from the Regional Council as we did,

so all custodians must be consulted. Then our business will get bigger,

and continue for our grand daughters and grandsons.<P>

`More

people will come and learn about the land. Much trouble has come from

people forgetting the land, the spirit. <P>

Many people are sick and have

lost their spirit. `But we can all learn and make our

spirit strong. Working together builds understanding between different

people of different cultures.'<P>

toilet areas clean? Then I would ask: How does a black organisation run

anyway?'<P>

Bob has struck a unique balance in creating a

successful indigenous tourism venture by combining the best of black and

white expertise. He has capitalised on indigenous culture and advice

while not isolating the project from wider support.<P>The

concept for the Centre, first promoted by the Central Queensland

Aboriginal Corporation for Cultural Activities, was approved by the

former Department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1986. Building started on

10.8 hectares of leased Rockhampton City Council land with an $850 000

Bicentennial Authority grant and a $250 000 Aboriginal Development

Commission grant. Bob was hired as General Manager.<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=309 HEIGHT=133  SRC="GIF/Croc.GIF">
`We

formed a registered company to avoid the pitfalls of politics within the

community and to ensure we had expertise on the Board', Bob says.<P>`We 
have three blacks and two whites on the Board. A lot of Aboriginal

groups I talk to are amazed that we have two whites on the Board.<P>`If 
you are considering a tourism venture you have to have the

expertise, whether they're black, white or brindle.'<P>The

two non-indigenous Board members are current and former Rockhampton City

Council aldermen. Council support has contributed significantly to the

project's success; this support has included funding for an information

centre.<P>

<IMG WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=272 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT20.GIF"><P>
Some members of the local indigenous community

initially resisted the project because of the funding source.<P>

`They said it was blood money because it had come from the Bicentennial

Authority. There were rumours they would boycott the opening, but they

didn't and we got through that', Bob says.<P>ATSIC

currently provides funding for the Centre but Bob foresees this drying

up in four years. This prospect has convinced him to change focus from

continuing to be a government-funded cultural centre to becoming

self-funded within four years.<P>To accomplish this, ATSIC

will hire a marketing professional on a one-year contract to actively

market the Centre and train two indigenous staff in marketing to

continue the program.<P>Over a three-year period, ATSIC

funding has been reduced from $670 000 per annum to $510 000 while gate

money has steadily increased and has been ploughed back into the Centre.

Currently the Centre takes $175 000 in gate money per annum; this is

expected to increase to $235 000 by the end of 1994.<P>

Staff wages are partially covered by ATSIC's Enterprise Employment

Assistance Scheme, which provides a weekly subsidy for each indigenous

employee formerly unemployed.<P>Bob successfully applied to

ATSIC for funding to build a theatre restaurant complex on the grounds.

This will expand the undercover facilities (a needed buffer for large

crowds in wet weather) and increase conference
capacity.<P>Accountability

to the government and the public has given the Dreamtime Cultural Centre

the credibility for ongoing funding.<P>

`An ATSIC representative has said you can see where every cent has been 
spent', Bob says. `We spend the money on what it was funded for. If it 
was $100 000 for wages we spend it on wages.'<P>

<I><B>"Bob...has capitalised on indigenous cultureand advice while not 
isolating the project from wider support"</B></I><P>
He attributes the

Centre's success to five main points: the management structure,

accountability, staff training and performance, goals and pace.<P>`We 
haven't gone too fast too quick. I remember taking $30 to $40 a day

when we kicked off (in 1988). We used to open four days a week and

charge $2.'<P>The Centre is now open seven days a week and

in 1994 will charge $9.50, a comparable price to rivals, for a two-hour

tour. It currently averages 90 people through the gate daily.<P>

In 1993 the Dreamtime Cultural Centre won the Southern Reef Tourism

Award for Culture and Heritage and was a finalist in the Cultural

Tourism section of both the Queensland Tourism Awards and the Australian

Tourism Awards.<P><B>More information about the Dreamtime

<P><I><B>Balarinji is a designer retail label created and marketed by 
Jumbana Design Pty Ltd. It employs 12 people (three indigenous). 
International tourists are reached through duty free shops. Retail sales 
of the Balarinji label in 1992-93 were up 70 per cent.</B></I></P><P></P>

<P>Aboriginal design is stepping onto the world stage and Jumbana Design 
is leading this new wave.</P><P></P>
<P><I><B>What began as a way of introducing a child to his two distinct 
cultures has blossomed into a multi-million dollar busienss at the 
forefront of Australian design.</B></I></P><P></P>
<P>`Australian' is the key word. For directors John and Ros Moriarty, 
their designs seek a cultural sharing, encouraging all Australians to own 
and be proud of the country's ancient roots.</P><P></P>
<P>Jumbana comes from John's bush name, given him by his Yanyuwa people 
from the Northern Territory. The company's flagship designer label, 
Balarinji, is their two young sons' `skin name', which denotes the 
social, family and legal obligations to their tribal group.</P><P></P>
<P>Since its beginning in 1983, this family business has grown to achieve 
an annual turnover of $4 million. Jumbana Design employs 12 staff and 
uses 15 manufacturers to work up its designs for casual fashion wear, 
swimwear and accessories such as ties, umbrellas, watches and 
sunglasses.</P><P></P>
<P>A range of pure wool carpets and designer eye wear is due for release 
soon.</P>
<I><B>Caption: A Balarinji silk Kimono for the Japanese market--<BR>

<IMG WIDTH=274 HEIGHT=400 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT22.GIF"><P>
<P>The Balarinji label has enjoyed a 70 per cent growth in sales in the 
past year and sales are expected to double in 1994.</P><P></P>
<P>Current markets include major department stores, duty free shops, 
up-market Australian boutiques and the company's licensed Concept store 
on the Gold Coast. Products also sell in Japan (50 designs commissioned 
each year) and France (Freetime casual and resort-style 
fashions).</P><P></P>
<P>`We have been very careful about our positioning within the tourist 
industry', says Ros, the 1993 South Australian Businesswoman of the 
Year.</P><P></P>
<P>`While we are claiming a large and increasing share of the 
international tourist dollar, we are not seeking an image which is a 
souvenir type of operation.'</P><P></P>
<P>Design consultancy work within the Australian corporate sector has 
included Australian National (graphic interior design for The Ghan, 
Indian Pacific and Overland railways); the Australian Tourist Commission, 
Australia Post and Budget Rent A Car (uniforms); and the Australian 
National Gallery.</P><P></P>
<P>`We have deliberately targeted companies which wanted to express their 
"Australianess" in terms of their corporate identity as this fits with 
our philosophy to get this type of generic design into high-profile 
places in Australia', Ros says.</P>
<I><B>Caption: John and Ros Moriarty with a product display. Ros says it 
is <BR>
important that Jumbana's products reflect their origins: 'The creativity 
we <BR>
want to express is bound up in being unmistakably tribal'.</B></I>
<IMG WIDTH=366 HEIGHT=238 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT24.GIF"><BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P>The Moriartys established the business with their own savings and 
several years of hard work.</P><P></P>
<P>`We started at a time when there was very little recognition of 
Aboriginal art or design, so it was very difficult getting appointments 
with department stores or shops or even to get people to license or 
manufacture the products for us.'</P><P></P>
<P>When company products were accepted, they were invariably placed at 
the bottom of shelves or in corners--yet still sold out.</P><P></P>
<P>`We just kept ploughing on and really it was a good six or seven years 
before we began to show some viability', Ros says.</P><P></P>
<P><I><B>"...we've seen companies burst onto the scene overnight with 
enormous resources but they have also disappeared almost as quickley, 
like shooting stars"</B></I></P>


<IMG WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=231 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIF/Woman.GIF">
<P>`I don't think there is ever a

big break frankly. I think business is about building blocks and often a

"lucky break" is putting a bigger building block onto the foundations

and climbing faster.'</P><P></P><P>Independence remains a key issue

for the couple and from the beginning a decision was made to avoid

government grants.</P><P></P><P>`This was important to us because

John's philosophy was against any dependence.'</P><P></P><P>John's

background explains this approach. He was taken from his family while

young and brought to Adelaide where, after a minimal amount of

schooling, he managed to put himself through university in the late

1960s--the first Aboriginal undergraduate in South 
Australia.</P><P></P><P>

The connection with both family communities is very strong but it is the

Yanyuwa people who show particular pride in the designs and who are

regularly approached for feedback on new designs.</P><P></P><P>This

was the original source of inspiration and as Jumbana expands into new

markets with new products it is also striving to maintain the essential

spark that first ignited its creative look.</P><P></P><P>`Our design

team is deliberately made up of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal artists,'

John says.</P><P></P><P>`It's that contemporary meeting of two

cultures that we really want to express with Balarinji and they each

bring their talent and inspiration to that process.'</P><P></P><P>While

Jumbana's design, marketing and retailing is sophisticated, the issue of

maintaining its links with the earthiness and raw energy of the original

culture is very strong.</P><P></P><P>`It's the central focus of where

we're going', Ros says. `Something which is simple, functional, well

designed and reflecting its origins is sophisticated. It doesn't mean

the lines have to become slick--that wouldn't be us. The creativity we

want to express is bound up in being unmistakably tribal.'</P><P></P><P>

The company's strategies and products have won a large, appreciative and

ever-expanding audience and the couple puts this down to the strength of

its vision.</P><P></P><P>`If you have a vision, you must stick to it',

John says. `We were lucky--we could have accepted some partnerships and

would have lost the control that we wanted. As a family company, we can

pick its destiny.'</P><P></P><P>`Our other advice would be to grow

slowly', Ros says. `That's been our saving grace as we've seen companies

burst onto the scene overnight with enormous resources but they have

also disappeared almost as quickly, like shooting stars.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>by Jerry Pratley</B></FONT><P></P><P><I><B>Kurrawang Emu 
Farm is owned by a local Aboriginal community and has 11 staff (10 
indigenous). Originally breeding emus and processing their products, 
Kurrawang has added on-site
tours and a retail outlet to cater for growing tourist interest in its 
operation.</B></I></P><P></P><P>Kurrawang Emu Farm Manager Mick Roe 
believes Aboriginal people have a natural advantage in the tourism 
business.</P><P>

</P><P>Mick says international and domestic tourists are crying out for 
information about Australia's indigenous culture and the demand will only 
get stronger.</P>
<I><B>Caption: Sales of emu products and emu chicks <BR>
are now Kurrawang's main earner but tourism <BR>
continues tobe an important source of income.</B></I>
<IMG WIDTH=232 HEIGHT=295 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT26.GIF"><P>
<P>Kurrawang, about 20 kilometres east of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, on the 
Great Eastern Highway in Western Australia, is an example of an 
Aboriginal community that has successfully tapped into tourists' desires 
to learn more about indigenous Australians. But Kurrawang does not rely 
solely on selling Aboriginal culture. It has exploited a growing niche 
market--emu products. </P><P></P><P>Aborigines have always used emu 
products but, until recently, white Australians have ignored what the 
native birds have to offer, such as oil, meat, eggs, feathers and 
leather.</P><P></P><P>In addition to the emu product sales, tours are 
conducted and visitors are told about Aboriginal 
culture.</P><P></P><P>Kurrawang began operating five years ago with the 
help of a $350 000 Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Aboriginal 
Development Corporation grant that helped set up emu holding pens, 
infrastructure to breed and hatch the birds and a tourist reception 
centre and shop.</P><P></P><P>According to Mick, tourism was the farm's 
major source of income in the beginning but the sale of emu products and 
emu chicks is now the main earner.</P><P></P><P>After the grant and 
initial set up, it took about two and a half years for the farm to become 
self-sufficient.</P><P></P><P>It still receives employment assistance 
through ATSIC's Community Development and Employment Program but is 
otherwise a growing, self-funded operation.</P><P></P><P>Today the farm 
employs 11 people and has an annual turnover of about $250 000 (and 
growing). </P><P></P><P>Mick says one of the most important things to 
consider when setting up a tourism venture, or any business, is to 
approach it in a professional way. </P><P></P><P>`There can't be any of 
this "come to work when you feel like it" business, it has to be treated 
as a nine-to-five operation.' </P><P></P><P>He says people considering 
establishing a venture need some business knowledge but if this is 
lacking, a manager could be employed to get the operation up and running 
and provide training for the community.</P><P></P><P>A non-Aboriginal, 
Mick was employed by the Kurrawang community to get the farm going but he 
will be leaving the community in 1994 to allow it to run 
itself.</P><P></P><P>For a community wanting to establish everything 
itself, there are government-funded training schemes that provide a 
grounding in how to establish and operate a business.</P><P></P><P>`It's 
all there for the asking', Mick says.</P>
<I><B>Caption: Kurrawangstaff with some of the farm's products. Most of 
the <BR>
products are processed and retailed by the farm rather than selling raw 
produce.</B></I>
<IMG WIDTH=364 HEIGHT=246 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT28.GIF">
<P>`When we started, there were a range of different departments we had 
to go through because ATSIC wasn't around then, but now ATSIC can provide 
help.</P><P></P><P>`I think the success of the business could be put down 
to the way we have decided to value-add to everything we produce so we 
can retail it ourselves.</P><P></P><P>`Most farms farm their produce and 
sell it bulk, but we farm it and retail it ourselves. It cuts out the 
middle man. You farm, value-add and retail. You handle the lot.</P><P>
<I><B>"International and domestic tourists are crying out for information 
abour Australia's indigenous culture and the demand will only get 
stronger"</B></I></P>
<IMG WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=238 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIF/Emu.GIF">
<P>`The carved eggs, for instance, are done here by the locals, we 
process the meat, the oil is quite easy to do once you've got it set up, 
we get a little bit of the leather made elsewhere but overall it is the 
cheapest way to do it.</P><P></P><P>`The major hurdles we had to overcome 
were associated with the initial setting up of the farm, getting all the 
incubators in place and just the general running 
around.'</P><P></P><P>Mick says one of the biggest influences on the 
farm's success was the self-supportive approach adopted by the Kurrawang 
community.</P><P></P><P>`We adopt a different attitude to most Aboriginal 
communities', he says. </P><P></P><P>`Our attitude was that initially we 
got funding to help set the place up then after that we wanted to fund 
everything else where possible.</P><P></P><P>`Instead of going straight 
into a Rolls Royce set-up--it has taken over four years to get where we 
are--we took things step-by-step.</P><P></P><P>`We have since had another 
one-off grant for capital expenditure.'</P><P></P><P>Another aspect the 
community considered was being close to a ready supply of tourists: 
Kalgoorlie-Boulder, an area of almost 30 000 people and Australia's 
biggest producer of gold.</P><P></P><P>`Probably 50

per cent of our visitors are local', Mick says. `It's very important to

have that local base. It's probably how we have got the numbers up

because we have promoted it to the local people.</P><P></P><P>`The

other tourists are made up of about 40 per cent from the eastern States

and 10 per cent international.</P><P></P><P>`There is a general mix of

nationalities which visit but the Asians in particular seem to be very

interested in Aboriginal culture.'</P><P></P><P>Mick says

international visitors demand a higher level of customer service than

domestic tourists. This is the next step in improving 
Kurrawang.</P><P></P><P

>`The international market is growing but we still haven't targeted it

fully', he says.</P><P></P><P>`Basically international people come by

coaches but we still have to get our bus facilities here.</P><P></P><P>`I


don't think we need anything too flash but we need proper toilet

facilities, tea and coffee and other things.</P>

`It makes it

more attractive for the coachlines because if we have all the facilities

here then the people can get everything they need without having to pull

up somewhere else down the road.'</P><P><I><B>"I think the success of the 
business could be put down to the way we have decided to value-add to 
everything we produce so we can retail it ourselves"</B></I></P><P>A big 
proportion of

Kurrawang's income is earned directly through the shop, which is

responsible for catering to tourists as well as managing the general

farm business. The latter now accounts for more than half the farm's

income.</P><P></P><P>`Tourism was the main money-spinner up until

about 12 months ago but now we are putting the farm products through the

shop.</P><P></P><P>`Also, for the last two or three years we have been

selling chicks to set up other farms. That has been going very 
well.'</P><P>

</P><P>Mick says the Kurrawang community has learned a lot about

running a business and combined their knowledge of egg carving, painting

and implement making with new-found marketing and farming 
skills.</P><P></P><P

tours of one to

four days for both domestic and international tourists. The enterprise

employs 21 people (20 indigenous). The current (non-indigenous) manager

is training the Jawoyn people to take over the day-to-day 
management.</B></I></P><P>

</P><P>Tourism has emerged as the most important of a range of ventures

aimed at developing a self-supporting community at Manyallaluk, in the

Northern Territory's Top End.</P><P></P><P>A no-frills demonstration

of the community's traditional way of life and surrounding country is

attracting a growing number of visitors from around Australia and

overseas.</P><P></P><P>What began as a low-key operation rose to

national prominence in 1993 with wins in the Northern Territory and

Australian tourism awards.</P><P></P><P>Manyallaluk, the former Eva

Valley cattle station and now Aboriginal land, lies south-east of

Katherine.</P><P></P><P>The community is based around the old bush

station buildings, which form a centrepiece for visitors. It's a modest

place, clean and well maintained--a tribute to the people who live there

and have pride in their land.</P>
<I><B>Caption: Visitors to Manyallaluk learn traditional <BR>

<IMG WIDTH=249 HEIGHT=371 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT

<P>Manyallaluk operates under

a recently incorporated community council, the Manyallaluk Aboriginal

Corporation, eking out an existence for a little over a hundred people

on wages paid to only a few. ATSIC funded the construction of a store,

already self-supporting, which serves both visitors and the community.

ATSIC also provides wages through its Enterprise Employment Assistance

Scheme.</P><P></P><P>Tourism entered into the scheme of things when,

in 1990, the Jawaluk Company, representing the interests of the Jawoyn

people, approached Terra Safari Tours operator Tom Winter to investigate

the potential for Aboriginal based tourism in the area. Tom had been

operating tours in the area for some time.</P><P></P><P>His

son-in-law, Murray Dennis, was assigned the task. Both he and the local

people quickly saw that an integrated approach towards better health,

hygiene, nutrition, all-round skills development and greater self-esteem

and confidence would be the only way to make the community

self-supporting.</P><P></P><P>Community members are building new

houses with funds from the Northern Territory Department of Lands and

Housing, transforming the run-down community and gaining valuable

construction training in the process.</P><P></P><P>Manyallaluk is a

dry area--no alcohol for residents or visitors alike. While this may

seem strange in an age of international tourism, it is not out of place

in this area of savannah woodland, melaleuca swamps and sandstone

escarpment.</P><P></P><P>Murray, in association with Peter Bolgi, the

new council president Manuel Pamkal and others, formed the nucleus of

the community's tourism operation by developing the skills of six tour

guides.</P>

run, was one of the first of those guides. Today, as supervisor, he

spearheads Manyallaluk's unique tour operation and a 19-strong

complement of guides who share the work on a week-on, week-off basis.

Peter's late father also worked on the station; although from the

coastal community of Maningrida, he was a powerful force in keeping

traditional knowledge in the area alive.</P><P>

</P><P>Peter, Richard

Miller (another former Eva Valley stockman) and other guides ensure

visitors are catered for on tours that assimilate the ancient and the

modern. </P>


<P>Terra Safari Tours uses Manyallaluk guides when

it takes visitors into the region. Murray says it is a good way for the

community to learn more about tourism without having to bear the expense

of buying and maintaining vehicles and equipment.</P><P></P><P>Visitors

can also drive their own vehicles over the dirt road to the community

but the people of Manyallaluk make it clear it is their country and they

alone have the right to show it to others.</P><P><I><B>Caption:

<P>Cars can go no

further than the homestead area, which is well-equipped with a modern

ablution block, camping sites and the store. Natural springs ensure

there is always fresh water in the nearby rock 
pool.</P><P></P><P>Manyallaluk

also brings people in by bus from Katherine, about 100 kilometres away,

for various tours.</P><P></P><P>A one-day cultural experience tells

visitors about local bush tucker and medicines and how to make billy tea

and damper. They mix with traditional owners, learning about painting

and how local artefacts are made, from gathering raw material such as

pandanus leaves for string dilly bags through to seeing the finished

article. The people of Manyallaluk are skilful hunters and their

accuracy with the spear impresses many visitors.</P><P></P><P>Another

tour incorporates an afternoon flight by light aircraft over the

neighbouring Katherine Gorge and Nitmiluk National Park.</P><P>
<I><B>"What began as a low-key operation rose to national prominence in 
1993 with wins in the Northern Territory and Australian tourism 
awards"</B></I></P><P>There's

also a four-day trek which takes visitors through rainforest and

sandstone escarpment country where they can see rock art thousands of

years old on the way down the Katherine River to the Gorge. There, they

are taken by launch for the final stage of this adventure, floating

through five spectacular gorges before being driven back to 
Katherine.</P><P

></P><P>A two-day tour is being developed for the next dry season, when

tourist traffic is at its heaviest.</P><P></P><P>Over the last 12

months the combined turnover from the tours and store totalled $280 000.

The Queensland-based Connections coach company alone took nearly 1 200

people through last season and other operators are keen to explore

Manyallaluk. </P><P></P><P>The Manyallaluk mob know that no amount of

advertising can compete with getting out and telling the world about

yourself.</P>

<P>Peter and Manuel regularly speak to travel

agents and tour wholesalers to familiarise them with Manyallaluk. Manuel

took part in the Northern Territory tourism roadshow through North

America in late 1993 and says that he made many good friends and

industry contacts.</P><P><I><B>"(Visitors) mix with traditional owners,

the

first few years of operation has increased the enthusiasm of the people

of Manyallaluk for their tourism venture. They continue to develop their

ability to interact with visitors from around the 
world.</P><P></P><P>Murray

is hopeful the operation will be self-supporting in three to four years

and, ideally, he will be out of a job.</P><P></P><P>But he and the

<TITLE>A Talent for Tourism - Tiwi Tours</TITLE>
<BODY  BACKGROUND="/images/jpg/chalk.jpg">

<FONT SIZE=4><B>by Garry Dembon</B></FONT><P></P>

<P><I><B>Tiwi Tours, a joint venture equally owned by the Tiwi Land 
Council and Australian Kakadu Tours, offers tours to Bathurst Island. The 
enterprise employs five people (one indigenous).</B></I></P><P>The Top 
End's Tiwi Islanders have got tourism wired. They have slipped it into 
their way of life so gently that it barely shows but at the same time it 
reaps them rich rewards.</P>

<I><B>Caption: Flying into the future: <BR>

<IMG VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="GIF/TFT34.GIF"><P>The 
handful of visitors who cross the Beagle Gulf each day from Darwin bring 
benefits far beyond their numbers. They are just one link in a chain of 
enterprises that let the Tiwi express their character and culture--and 
their entrepreneurial skills.</P>
<P>Bathurst and Melville islands lie 80 kilometres north of the Northern 
Territory capital. They are sparsely populated; more than half their 2 
000 inhabitants live at Nguiu on Bathurst Island.</P>
<P><I><B>"Following airline deregulation two years ago the company 
established its own airline, using a local charter company. Then Tiwi 
Tours really took off"</B></I></P><P>The Tiwi have embraced European ways 
and blended them with their own. Nguiu (pronounced `new you') boasts 
modern three-bedroom bungalows and carefully tended gardens. In the 
cemetery their dead lie beneath Christian headstones and traditional 
pukumani burial poles.</P>
<P>The Tiwi Land Council controls nine businesses, ranging from buffalo 
exports to a pearl farm. All began as joint ventures. Two, a timber 
plantation and a fishing lodge, are now run solely by the Council. The 
Nguiu community itself also runs two fabric design and screen printing 
houses, a clothing factory, a pottery and a cottage arts and crafts 
industry.</P><P></P><P>Organised tourism came to the islands in the early 
eighties with a small day-return operation run from Darwin. Then the Tiwi 
wanted to show more of their traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and 
they recruited another Darwin company, Australian Kakadu Tours (AKT), to 
start a safari camp. In 1989 the Land Council bought the day tour and 
offered AKT a joint venture deal. Tiwi Tours was about to take 
off.</P><P></P><P>AKT was a well-established tour company with an 
international marketing network that drew 70 per cent of its custom from 
overseas, primarily Europe. Its marketing manager and founding partner, 
Darrell Tutty, had 20 years' experience. He was Darwin born and had grown 
up with Aborigines. The

Tiwi had looked carefully and found a winning combination.</P><P></P><P>

`It's very important in joint venturing to get the right person', says

Darrell. `I started with the advantage of having had close contact all

my life with Aboriginal people and having the right business

credentials.</P><I><B>Caption: Cross-cultural tour operator Darrell 
Tuttey <BR>
in the Tiwi pukumani pole display at Darwin Airport</B></I><IMG VSPACE=5 
HSPACE=10 BORDER=4  SRC="GIF/TFT36.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT><P>`Just because 
you're white doesn't mean to

say you can run a business. Likewise, just because Aborigines are black

doesn't mean they all think the same. A person living in the city has a

different outlook than a 70-year-old living on an 
island.</P><P></P><P>`So

a European going into a venture has to understand the politics of the

thing: what the community thinks, what the elders--the

powerbrokers--think; who to see to change something; who's responsible

for a particular area; how significant it is; how the market will

respond.'</P><P></P><P>It's much the same from the other perspective,

according to Tiwi Land Council manager Marius 
Puruntatameri.</P><P></P><P>

`You've got to see things both ways, the culture and European way',

Marius says. `If you've got no experience you must work with a person

who's experienced. That's how you learn. From there on you can operate

yourself and teach other people.</P><P></P><P>`We always look at the

two sides of the story before we make a decision, make sure we talk to

experts, take legal advice. And we always talk with those at the top,

those people who can make the decisions. That's our 
policy.'</P><P></P><P>

AKT and the Land Council have equal shares in Tiwi Tours but the Council

collects a $10 royalty on every visitor, so the community benefits even

if the company loses money. The company has been profitable from the

start.</P><P>
<IMG WIDTH=236 HEIGHT=217 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIF/Turtle.GIF">
</P><P>A maximum of 2 500 tourists a year are flown to

Nguiu from the mainland and shown around the community by minibus. Their

stops are predetermined so those locals who do not want to be involved

can maintain their privacy. Visitors are not allowed to wander freely;

those seeking a deeper experience can spend a few days at the Melville

Island safari camp.</P><P></P><P>At first the returns were put back

into infrastructure. The Tiwi have since used their share of profits to

establish a school nutrition program and run a museum. The indirect

benefits, however, are much greater.</P><P></P><P>Tiwi Tours' biggest

single cost has always been airfares, but following airline deregulation

two years ago the company established its own airline, using a local

charter company. Then Tiwi Tours really took off.</P><P></P><P>`The

idea was to save money on the tours', Darrell says, `but at the same

time it gives the Tiwi people a cheaper passenger service for themselves

and a cheaper air freight service'.</P><P></P><P>Nguiu's artists,

potters, wood carvers, screen printers and dress and shirt makers have

also benefited by selling and exporting their wares. Darrell estimates

the combined value of exports from the islands is about $1.5 million a

year.</P><P></P><P>His company manages the business, handling the

logistics, sales, marketing, development and staffing, while the Tiwi

provide the artistic and cultural input. `I talk to them about

everything I do, out of courtesy and respect for them as my partners',

Darrell adds.</P><P></P><P>Both say the relationship works well and

there have been no real problems. Both also look forward to the time

Tiwi Tours will be managed and staffed by Tiwi people, while accepting

that not all jobs in tourism appeal to the Islanders.</P><P></P><P>Says

Darrell: `Tiwi Tours is a tourism business, and tourists expect certain

standards of dress, hygiene, timekeeping and behaviour. End of story. If

you want to do that job you've got to conform'.</P>
<P>
<I><B>"Be aware that the Aboriginal experience appeals to only about ten 
per cent ot the market, and it's no good trying to sell a three-day 
desert trek to a guy who's only got half a day to 
spend"</B></I></P><P>Marius

agrees: `The opportunity is there to show the outside world who we are,

what we are, and to support our future. The important thing is to

educate our children in both ways, European and Tiwi. We'd like our

students to keep doing courses that will be helpful to the community

businesses, to see this place run by Tiwi people'.</P><I><B>Caption:

HSPACE=10 BORDER=4  SRC="GIF/TFT37.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT><P>Darrell

has words of warning for budding tour operators: `If the bank won't lend

the money it's not viable, so don't do it. Be aware that the Aboriginal

experience appeals to only about ten per cent of the market, and it's no

good trying to sell a three-day desert trek to a guy who's only got half

a day to spend.</P><P></P><P>`And beware the advisers and consultants,

a lot of them have their own agendas. Aboriginal people should look at

the mistakes Europeans have made and realise everyone wants value for

money and that some of the words of the white man are not real true some

of the time.'</P><P></P><P>Adds Marius: `You can't expect to make

money overnight. You've got to plan for the future and work hard for

it'.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><B>by John Schalch</B></FONT><P></P><P><I><B>Tjapukai Dance 
Theatre presents

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dance and theatre to domestic and

international tourists. Jointly owned by indigenous and non-indigenous

people, it has 36 full-time staff (30 indigenous) and 8 indigenous

part-time staff.</B></I></P><P></P><P>Tenacity has paid off for a group 
of

people who set their sights on attaining remarkable goals in the

cultural tourism industry and are now reaping the benefits of long, hard

early years.</P><P></P><P>Don and Judy Freeman, as the driving

partnership behind the internationally acclaimed Tjapukai Aboriginal

Dance Theatre, go out of their way to get the message of early toil

across to would-be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander performers,

entrepreneurs or artists who are considering setting out on the

adventurous road to the top.</P><P></P><P>`It is a lot of hard work',

Judy says. `You cannot take it on and not deliver a quality 
product.</P><P>

</P><P>`Tourism is a seven-days-a-week industry and you can't just

decide one day that you're not going to get out of bed and do it _

although you might feel like it sometimes.' </P><P></P><P>Tjapukai's

success had humble beginnings in May 1987 when the Freemans decided to

use their vast overseas knowledge of community theatre to establish what

was planned to be just a small dance troupe performing in a burgeoning

tourist village--the picturesque rainforest town of Kuranda, in far

north Queensland.</P><P>
<I><B>Caption: Don and Judy Freeman inside Tjapukai's <BR>$1 Million

week</B></I>
<IMG WIDTH=245 HEIGHT=354 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT38.GIF">
</P><P>With talented local Aboriginal David

Hudson and his wife Cindy, the Freemans set to work to deliver a quality

product that encapsulated Aboriginal culture in a way that would be

understood by European patrons.</P><P></P><P>It began as a black and

white friendship and developed deeper when Don, David and six young men

from the Djabugay tribe formed the Tjapukai Aboriginal Dance Theatre and

wrote a play for the tourists.</P><P></P><P>Both Don and Judy agree

they had no preconceptions of what Aboriginal people could or could not,

should or should not, do.</P><P></P><P>`Many of our friends said we

were crazy', Judy recalls. `They said it wouldn't work; and especially

when we decided to charge $7.50 entrance, our friends declared nobody

would pay that.'</P><P></P><P>Almost as soon as they opened they hit

the first of many hurdles when the national pilots' strike cut off the

supply of tourists. In its first year the Theatre traded for only six

months, closing for the tourist `off season', a mistake the Freemans

quickly recognised in what is a 24-hour, year-round 
industry.</P><P></P><P>

But in the six years that followed, the impact of the Theatre was

phenomenal--locally, regionally, nationally and internationally--with

Queensland and Australian tourism awards and international praise heaped

on the proud clan.</P><P></P><P>Tjapukai began with a $45 000 capital

base of private funds and has received no government funding apart from

assistance under Department of Employment, Education and Training Labour

Market Programs for the employment and training of Aboriginal and Torres

Strait Islander people.</P><P></P><P>Now it has built its own $1

million theatre complex, employs 44 staff (38 Aboriginal), presents 17

shows a week and last financial year recorded a 20 per cent increase in

gross revenue to more than $1.5 million.</P><P></P><P>According to

Don, the lesson for Aboriginal employment is that without the skill,

dedication and endurance of its staff, Tjapukai could not 
exist.</P><P></P><P

>He believes the most important single thing that has led to Tjapukai's

ever-increasing Aboriginal employment (up 15 per cent in the past year)

is that it is successful as a business.</P><P></P><P>`And it is a

successful business because that is its primary motivation _ it was not

formed as part of a land rights claim, or to raise the status of one

clan or language group over another, or as a social experiment', he

says.</P><P></P><P>`It is a business dedicated to providing a quality

tourism product to a dynamic industry.'</P><P></P><P>Don says the

Aboriginal operator must be willing to work within the operating

parameters of the tourism industry.</P><P></P><P>`You may think you

have something wonderful and unique, but if it is not packaged and

presented to the industry in a viable and digestible manner, it will

never provide economic self-sufficiency for Aboriginal people.'</P><P>

</P><P

>Success means moving through customer satisfaction to the level of

customer delight.</P><P>
<I><B>"You may think you have something wonderful and Unique, but if it 
is not packaged and presented to the industry in a viable and digestible 
manner, it will never provide economic self-sufficiency for Aboriginal 
people"</B></I></P>
<IMG WIDTH=295 HEIGHT=121 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIF/Fish.GIF"><P>`That is not 
to say an Aboriginal

product needs to be in any way demeaning to the culture. But once you

have decided what portion of the culture you are going to share with the

tourists and how you are going to show it, you must deliver it in a

professional, responsible and reliable way.</P><P></P><P>`And you must

make real contact with the people; you must show some of the heart and

soul which is the core of Aboriginality. If you invite someone into your

home, culture or community, you take responsibility for them _ they are

your guests.</P><P></P><P>`Good customer service is about

inconveniencing yourself.'</P><P></P><P>Judy, Don and the staff all

echo this sentiment--working at Tjapukai is like being part of a big,

happy family.</P><P></P><P>It still amazes the Freemans how many staff

members will come to the Theatre to hang out on their day off because

they are part of what's happening there.</P><P></P><P>Willie Brim, one

of the original dance troupe, agrees wholeheartedly. </P><P></P><P>Aside

from enjoying the financial benefits of his work with the Theatre,

feeling part of a team has been crucial to a major change in his

self-esteem and his way of thinking. </P><P></P><P>`I've changed

considerably in my attitudes about whites. Instead of fighting with them

now we work together', Willie says. </P><P></P><P>Originally from Mona

Mona mission and a member of the Djabugay tribe from which Tjapukai

derives its name, Willie says racism was `bred into you on the 
mission'.</P><P

></P><P>`But this (Tjapukai Theatre) is a way to make it better.'</P><P>

</P><P>He is well aware there are some Aboriginals and Torres Strait

Islanders in the industry who harbour resentment to whites and he warns

it will ultimately hold them back in their bid for success.</P><P></P><P>


`I forget about the past. You don't look at the past any more', he 
says.</P><P

></P><P>At the same time, Willie values his culture and appreciates the

chance to rescue it from extinction.</P><P></P><P>`If this (Tjapukai)

had not been set up for another 5-10 years, the culture would die along

with the elders.'</P><P></P><P>He has some words of advice for those

keen to follow in his footsteps.</P><P></P><P>`Be careful where you

set up and make sure you have the full support of the town or area. And

make sure you consult the elders, or you'll find 
trouble.'</P><P><I><B>"Itis a hard, competitive industry, but it has the 
additional benefit that it is the very Aboriginality of the participants 
which the tourist wants"</B></I></P><P>

Tjapukai is promoted on a world scale: the group performed at  Expo '88

and the recent Australian Music Awards, and has visited almost every

major tourism country at the invitation of either the Australian

Government or the country's own government.</P><P>
</P><P>Through the

Far North Queensland Promotion Bureau and Tjapukai's own marketing

program, the Theatre attracts a cross-section of international and

domestic tourists, reflecting the general pattern of visitors to far

north Queensland.</P><P>

tourism as a career have an equal responsibility to see that the work

they do is never short of excellent; that their primary concern is to

help, entertain and educate the tourists who create the wealth which

pays their wages', Don says.</P><P></P><P>`Tourism is a viable career

choice for Aboriginal people. But it is not a cure-all.</P><P></P><P>`It

is a hard, competitive industry, but it has the additional benefit that

it is the very Aboriginality of the participants which the tourist

<I><B>Umorrduk Safaris Arnhem Land guides 
tours of Aboriginal rock art, culkture and wilderness areas, targeting

international tourists. Its two owners/employees are indigenous, with

casual staff employed as required. Umorrduk could be bought by the

Gummulkbun people within four years.</B></I><P>

Staying small is the

secret of success for Umorrduk Safaris.<P>

That's how Brian

Rooke sums up the four successful years of this all-Aboriginal tourist

safari venture in western Arnhem Land, 365 kilometres north-east of

Darwin.<P>

Brian and his wife, Phyllis Williams, specialise

in taking small groups of tourists through the Mudjeegarrdart homelands

of the Gummulkbun people, a stunning area featuring some of the world's

best rock art and unspoilt wilderness.<P>

`Aboriginal

tourism is the leading edge of tourism at the moment. It's as hot as a

pancake', Brian says of their decision to start a tourist operation.<P>
<I><B>Caption: Umorrduk Safaris' Brian Rook. <BR>
An unabashed admirer of the Gummulkbun <BR>
people's land in Arnhem Land, he is helping <BR>
to introduce a range of Australian and <BR>
International visitors to its beauty</B></I>
<IMG WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=246 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT41.GIF"><P>

`Phyllis and I decided to start a business operating from her

family's land in Arnhem Land. We had a little place out there, a private

camp a bit like an outstation. It had everything, a beautiful little

creek, a waterfall, so we set up a permanent tented camp. It

indisputably has the most beautiful and prolific rock art in the world.

Nowhere will you find more rock art.<P>

'Umorrduk started on

a very small scale while the pair decided whether they liked the role of

tourism operators and gauged the Gummulkbun people's acceptance of

visitors.<P>

`We started doing drive-in tours targeting the

local market', Brian explains.<P>

`We were approached by

another local who wanted to bring people in by aeroplane. After the

first tour we decided the best way was to fly in and leave the vehicles

in the bush. That way we can concentrate on what we're good at--running

the camp and promoting the bush to the clients.<P>

'The

tropical wet season can create problems for tourist operators in

northern Australia but with the air link Umorrduk is able to soften the

impact by concentrating on day trippers.<P>

Phyllis is very

much a local. Her father, John Williams, is a traditional owner and

tribal elder of the Gummulkbun people, while her mother is a Larrakia

from the Darwin region.<P>

Brian, on the other hand, is a

long way from home. Born and raised on the Flinders Islands in Bass

Strait, he left Tasmania for a working holiday around Australia almost

20 years ago.<P>
<I><B>"Aboriginal tourism is the leading edge of tourism at the moment 
It's as hot as a pancake"</B></I><P>

`I met Phyllis in Darwin. I never did make

it around the rest of Australia', he explains. <P>

`Eventually

we set up in a gardening business and did that until the opportunity for

tourism arose. I love getting out in the bush and the opportunity came

to earn a living out in the bush.<P>

SRC="GIF/TFT42.GIF"><P>

'The business has built

up slowly, using existing funds and operating profits rather than

borrowing finance.<P>

`Our approach to running the business

is one step after another with no debt', Brian says.<P>

He

believes there are three essential elements to running a successful

tourism business: `Reliability, reliability, reliability.<P>

`It

doesn't matter how good a guide you are or how good at bush tucker, if

you're not there to show them, it's not worth two bob. You need to put

in a lot of hard work to gain the confidence of the industry.

'<P>
<I><B>"One of the reasons we stay with small numbers is so we don't have 
any impact on the country, otherwise it just gets over-run"</B></I><P>


<IMG WIDTH=154 HEIGHT=323 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="GIF/Man.GIF">
Brian says there was an initial reluctance to accept Aboriginal

operators as part of the tourism mainstream but this is changing as

operations such as Umorrduk continue their success.<P>

`It's

been a problem in the past, there have been operators who've let the

industry down badly. Chris Burchett at the (NT) Tourist Commission has

done a great job at breaking down that barrier.<P>

`We have

employed local Aboriginal people at the camp in various roles and as

guides.' The company has received some assistance under Department of

Employment, Education and Training Labour Market Programs.

<P>

`We pay a royalty to the clan and that money is divided up between the

people.<P>

`When we set out we knew that tourism can be

destructive to both the country and the culture. If you're careful how

you go ahead you can turn it into a positive thing which strengthens the

culture. It gives the Aboriginal people a sense of self-worth when they

realise there are people who respect and value Aboriginal culture. <P>

`One of the reasons we stay with small numbers is so we don't

have any impact on the country, otherwise it just gets over-run.<P>

'Like the operation itself, marketing the product has grown slowly but

professionally. In the early days most of Umorrduk's clients came from

the Darwin market. Brian estimates 90 per cent are now international

travellers, including more than half from the United States.

<P>

`The international market absolutely love it. Most of them have never

experienced true bush before. Where we are is real bush.<P>

`The

(NT) Tourist Commission has done a lot to assist us. We also employ a

local marketing company and I do promotional trips. I recently went to

America and last year to the ITB in Germany, to the Expo in Spain and to

London.<P>

'Marketing and promotion are made easier by

working with other operators in Arnhem Land to offer a range of

experiences in simple packages. Umorrduk is working on these packages

with major tourist ventures such as the luxury five-star Seven Spirit

Bay wilderness resort on the Cobourg Peninsula.<P>

`They

complement what we do here. We send people to them and they send some of

their people to us. We're starting to provide tours which combine a

five-star experience with what we do. Tourists don't have to shop around

for individual tours.<P>

'Brian says decisions affecting the

operation are made in close consultation with the Gummulkbun people.<P>

`Phyllis and I sit down and work out together what is best for

the business. If we want to change something we take it to the clan and

consult before we make a decision about what we can do on their land.

The clan elders decide what we can and can't do.<P>

'Looking

ahead three or four years, there could be an exciting development for

the Gummulkbun people.<P>
<I><B>Caption: Arnhem Land's beauty and variety attracts thousands of 
tourists every year, <BR>but the owners of Umorrduk Safaris have kept 
their operation small to minimise the <BR>impact on the land and retain 
the personalised service that has made their venture <BR>a sucess</B></I>

<IMG WIDTH=402 HEIGHT=264 VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT 
SRC="GIF/TFT44.GIF">
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
`We'd like to sell (Umorrduk) to

the people, we'll ask them if they're interested in buying the

business', Brian says. `We'd like to see more involvement by the rest of

the clan. I'd stay on as manager but they'd be more involved if they

owned the business.<P>

`They'd also be eligible for

assistance under the ATSIC policy to make any improvements to the

operation. Phyllis would like it to continue on a small scale - not to

get out of control - to retain the qualities that make the product what

it is. <P>

`There's a lot of people out there who are

willing to pay for a more personalised and exclusive experience.'<P>

</A></H1>
<P>Rural tourism provides an opportunity for country Australia to share
in the nation's spectacular tourism growth. Through planned development
and targeted marketing of the diverse range of rural tourism products
available, country towns, local communities and individuals can benefit
from this emerging segment of the tourism industry.</P><P></P><P>Enticing
tourists to venture beyond Australia's capital cities will not only
benefit rural areas, but will demonstrate a greater diversity of tourism
product that can make Australia more competitive as an international
tourism destination. </P><P></P><P>To realise the potential of rural
tourism, it is necessary to develop and package new and better tourism
products that are responsive to the current demands of visitors, both
domestic and international. Travellers are seeking environments in rural
Australia that combine recreational, cultural, educational and social
experiences with country living. To capitalise on this demand for a
`country experience', a number of key issues must be addressed.</P><P></P><P
>The Federal Government believes that an overall policy framework for
the development and marketing of rural tourism nation-wide will serve to
optimise the benefits it offers to both Australians and tourists. The
<I>National Rural Tourism Strategy</I> encourages an integrated
approach to improvements in this industry sector.</P><P></P><P>The
Strategy has been developed in consultation with industry and the
public, including a national call for submissions on <I>Tourism
Discussion Paper No. 1--Rural Tourism </I>that was circulated for
comment in January 1993 (see Appendix A). Later that year, a Rural
Tourism Focus Group, comprising key tourism representatives from
industry and government (see Appendix B), assisted in identifying major
issues affecting rural tourism development, including product and
enterprise development, marketing, industry standards, and education and
training. </P><P></P><P>This year, a needs analysis consultancy,
funded by the Federal Government and commissioned by Australian Farm and
Country Tourism Inc., examined these issues further and its findings
have been incorporated into the National Rural Tourism Strategy.</P><P></P><P
>The Government's commitment to rural tourism is evidenced in its
provision of a $42&nbsp;million package of regional tourism development
initiatives announced in the 1993-94 Budget, including some $4 million
over four years specifically for the Rural Tourism Program.</P><P></P><P>
Under this program, a total of $933&nbsp;000 was allocated in 1993-94
for discretionary projects, consistent with the directions of the Rural
Tourism Focus Group. These projects had national application which
included support for industry leadership; education in sales and
marketing; customer-service training; international marketing,
specifically of rural tourism; and demonstration projects which have a
regional emphasis.</P><P></P><P>The Strategy will guide funding
initiatives for the remaining three years of the Rural Tourism Program,
complementing the work that is already under way.</P><P></P><P>I
believe the<I> National Rural Tourism Strategy </I>provides the
framework required for government and industry to successfully advance
the rural tourism industry into a prosperous and sustainable future.</P><P>
</P><P></P><P></P><P><B>Michael Lee MP</B></P><P><B></B>Federal
Minister for Tourism</P><P>December 1994</P><P>
</P><H1><A NAME="RTFToC2">Overview</A></H1>
<B></B><P><B>Rural tourism </B>has been defined broadly as a <B>country
experience</B>. The range of tourism products includes rural
attractions, rural adventure and nature-based tours, country towns,
rural resorts, farm stays<B> </B>and other styles of country
accommodation, country<B> </B>festivals and events, and agricultural
education.</P><P></P><P>The <I>National Rural Tourism Strategy</I>
examines the importance of rural tourism as an industry and looks at how
industry and government can contribute to its growth through considered
planning, development and management. Because tourism can have a
significant impact on the economic and social well-being of rural
communities, as well as affecting the environment, there is a need to
consider fully the variety of changes tourism can bring and to seek
outcomes that are sustainable over the medium and longer term.</P><P></P><P
>The Strategy describes the many participants in this emerging industry.
The programs and initiatives of Federal, State and Territory Governments
are briefly mentioned. </P><P></P><P>The key issues requiring action
by stakeholders have been identified through an extensive consultation
process. In addition, the Strategy incorporates comments by a needs
analysis consultancy (funded by the Federal Government) undertaken by
Australian Rural Management Services and commissioned by Australian Farm
and Country Tourism Inc. The consultancy was required to define and
analyse impediments to rural tourism growth and to suggest practical
measures to address them. </P><P></P><P>The key issues, which are
detailed in Chapter 6, are:</P><P>	increased focus on product and
enterprise development, particularly featuring regional integration;</P><P>
	the need for appropriate accreditation and industry standards to ensure
services and products are of sufficient quality and are competitive;</P><P>
	provision of opportunities for education and training for new and
experienced rural tourism operators;</P><P>	facilitation of innovative
and cooperative marketing to both the domestic and international
traveller;</P><P>	undertaking of market analysis to allow informed
policy formulation, planning, development of product and targeting of
markets, and to aid investment in rural tourism;</P><P>	provision of
strong and informed industry leadership;</P><P>	provision of transport
and infrastructure; and</P><P>	recognition of the important role of
local government in furthering rural tourism in the regions.</P><P>
</P><H1><A NAME="RTFToC3">Implementation</A></H1>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/images/yellow_rock.gif"><H1><A NAME="RTFToC1">CHAPTER 1 WHAT IS RURAL TOURISM?
</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC2">1.1 Definition of rural tourism
</A></H2>
<P>Rural tourism is a multifaceted activity that takes place in an
environment outside heavily urbanised areas. It is an industry sector
characterised by small scale tourism businesses, set in areas where land
use is dominated by agricultural pursuits, forestry or natural areas.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism can represent to the traveller the essence of country
life. It would be unwise to define rural tourism too narrowly as it
involves travellers' perceptions that they are experiencing `the
country'.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism should be seen as offering a different range of
experiences to those offered in big cities. In Australia, 86 per cent of
the population live in cities with a population of 100&nbsp;000 or more,
and for many of these urban dwellers a visit to the country adds variety
to their day-to-day life. To many international visitors,<B> </B>rural<B>
 </B>Australia provides a unique experience.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC3">1.2 The components
</A></H2>
<P><B>The emphasis in rural tourism is on the tourist's experience of
the products and activities of rural Australia. </B></P>
<P><B></B></P>
<P>A tourist<B> </B>(or visitor or traveller) is any person taking a
day trip or staying overnight who is travelling more than 40 kilometres
away from his or her normal place of residence, except to commute to and
from his or her usual place of work. This includes domestic and
international travel, whether for business or pleasure. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism<B> </B>products/activities are numerous. Activities
contributing to the experience include relaxing; sightseeing; camping;
visiting friends and relatives; discovering historic towns; travelling
to heritage sites of cultural and social significance; visiting museums
and art galleries; shopping for local arts and crafts and produce;
wining and dining; and attending festivals, rodeos, country shows and
local sporting events. People may participate in sport (golf, fishing,
local cricket games), hiking in national parks, rafting, skiing,
abseiling and caving. Holidays can involve farms, either through
agribusiness tours or farm stays. Other visitors may elect to stay in
caravan parks, country motels/hotels or resorts, bed and breakfasts or
backpacker accommodation. Tours can be taken to scenic areas, wildlife
reserves, wineries and factories, either for pleasure or educational
purposes.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism activities in Australia are often segmented into the
following categories:</P>
<UL><LI>rural attractions;</LI>
<LI>rural adventure tours, nature-based tours, and ecotourism tours;</LI>
<LI>country towns;</LI>
<LI>rural resorts<B> </B>and other styles of country accommodation;</LI>
<LI>farm and station holidays;</LI>
<LI>festivals and events, and;</LI>
<LI>agricultural education.</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>In addition, the rural tourism experience should not be confined to
what happens at the destination: the travelling involved can be an
integral part of the `country experience'.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In defining `rural Australia' for the purposes of this Strategy,
various interpretations were considered.1 In line with the broad view to
be taken in a national strategy and to encompass the wide distribution
of rural tourism products, the Department of Tourism (DoT) has adopted
the definition used in the Commonwealth Working Group's Report, <I>Rural
Data </I>(1992).<I></I>Rural Australia is defined as `those geographic
areas which exclude the Capital City Statistical Divisions and the
Statistical Subdivisions which surround other urban centres whose
populations exceed 100 000'.</P>
<P></P>
<P>This means that rural tourism can exist outside of Australian
capital cities and Canberra-Queanbeyan, Newcastle, Wollongong, Geelong,
Gold Coast-Tweed-Albert Shire Part B and Townsville-Thuringowa. While it
is recognised that this wide definition classifies some moderately large
population centres as rural, it reflects the perceptions that many
visitors, especially those from overseas, have of travelling in
Australia. It also gives people living and working in these areas the
chance to participate in programs devised to develop and promote rural
tourism.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In Australia, rural tourism is sometimes segmented into island,
coastal, hinterland, country, bush, outback or remote tourism. (Some of
these terms are overlapping and the areas they refer to can differ
according to the user.) This segmentation can, however, be used
successfully to delineate niche market destinations and the type of
travel within the broad definition of rural tourism used in this
Strategy.</P>
<P></P>
<P>1	The Australian Bureau of Statistics broadly identifies urban as a
population cluster of 1 000 or more people.  Local government areas are
classified according to population, population density and land use:  a
general measure is a population cluster greater than 20 000.  Even
within the Australian Automobile Association, definitions of `rural'
vary: `Country area, Pastoral or Agricultural' (Royal Automobile Club of
Queensland), `Outside of a City/Town limit and therefore not in settled
areas' (Royal Automobile Association of South Australia), `Rural is any
area outside the major urban areas' (National Roads and Motorists
Association); and `Rural is anything outside the urban boundary of major
centres' (Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania). </P>
<P></P>
<P>	The Tourism Committee of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) sees `rurality as a concept ... connected with
low population densities and open space, and with small scale
settlements, generally of fewer than 10 000 inhabitants (where) ... land
use is dominated by farming, forestry and natural areas'. 
</P>
<H1><A NAME="RTFToC4">CHAPTER 2 WHY DEVELOP RURAL TOURISM?
</A></H1>
<P>In Australia, as in many countries, the value of tourism for rural
development is increasingly being recognised.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Local communities can gain significant benefits from rural tourism,
provided it is properly planned and managed. Benefits include:</P>
<UL><LI>increased non-agricultural income;</LI>
<LI>diversification of the region's economic base; and </LI>
<LI>improved employment opportunities in rural areas from associated
activities.
</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>There are also social and environmental advantages such as:</P>
<UL><LI>the use of visitor facilities for community purposes; </LI>
<LI>greater community cohesion with fewer young people drifting to the
cities to find work; </LI>
<LI>opportunities for interaction with people from differing
socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds; </LI>
<LI>the recognition of the need to preserve the `natural' landscape for
both tourists and others. Indeed, tourism can promote more interest in
repairing environments through such activities as tree planting,
sustainable farming practices, repairing coastal sand dunes, etc.; and</LI>
<LI>the enhancement of the built environment.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>The development of rural areas through tourism is consistent with
the Federal Government's regional development initiatives which
emphasise the capacity of regional Australia to `help itself' and be
proactive in attracting investment. Government initiated studies such as
those of the Taskforce on Regional Development, <I>Developing
Australia: A Regional Perspective</I>, and the McKinsey Report, <I>Lead
Local Compete Global</I> (1994b), focus on the strategic modernisation
and development of regional Australia, including its tourism potential.
The White Paper on Employment and Growth, <I>Working Nation,
</I>and the Industry Commission report, <I>Impediments to Regional
Industry Adjustment,</I> also emphasise the importance of regions
increasing their self-sufficiency and focusing more on integration with
the national economy, thus enhancing the country's overall productive
capacity. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The Government's commitment to developing and diversifying regional
economies by assisting the tourism industry is evident in a number of
tourism programs that were introduced in the 1993-94 Federal Budget.
Besides the Rural Tourism Program (described in Chapter 7), the Regional
Tourism Development Program, the National Ecotourism Program, the Sites
of National Tourism Significance Program and the Backpacker Program all
have a bearing on the development of tourism in regional Australia.
These programs, including the Forest Ecotourism Program developed under
the <I>National Forest Policy Statement</I>, are administered by the
Commonwealth Department of Tourism and detailed in Appendix C.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC5">2.1 Benefits
</A></H2>
<P>Tourism development needs to be sustainable if it is to bring about
<B>long-term </B>economic, environmental and social gains. To survive
as a viable industry, tourism must be developed with the needs of the
community and the environment in mind and in line with plans for the
development of a region as a whole. Otherwise there is a danger that
long-term benefits and the sustainability of the industry can be
sacrificed for short-term gains.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Economic benefits</P>
<P></P>
<P>As the Bureau of Tourism Research (BTR) forecasts 4.8 million
international visitors per year by the year 2000, it is important that
the economic benefits of tourism be spread to Australia's rural
communities.</P>
<P></P>
<P>While there is currently no clear estimate of the value of rural
tourism in Australia, figures from the BTR suggest that 60 per cent of
domestic tourism expenditure and around 20 per cent of international
tourism expenditure occur outside the major urban centres. In 1993,
these figures combined amounted to more than $12 billion.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Tourism can therefore represent an additional source of income to a
rural community. The primary source of income will often be derived from
agricultural, mining, forestry or fishing industries, which in
themselves may be an attraction for visitors. This complementarity is
demonstrated in the case of the wine growing areas of Australia, where
tourism forms a profitable adjunct to an already successful and
prosperous industry.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Tourism initiatives also have the potential to add further value to
an existing rural resource. An example of this is the Tambo Teddies
initiative in central Queensland. In this case, a small group of local
Tambo people, as a result of involvement in a Queensland
Government-supported workshop, identified the manufacture of teddy bears
from sheep skin as a viable cottage industry. Tambo Teddies has become
an additional attraction for tourists to central Queensland, adding to
such recognised attractions as the Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach
and extending the tourism diversity offered along the Matilda Highway.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Tourism can provide an opportunity to expand the economic base of a
local area or region and can bring to the community a number of new
skills and employment opportunities. Accommodation, entertainment, food
provision, information services and souvenirs of the rural experience
are all parts of the tourism industry. These factors bring extra income
directly to a rural area. They also have a regional<B> </B>economic
multiplier effect as this additional income is spent by recipients.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Environmental benefits</P>
<P></P>
<P>The relationship of tourism to the physical<B> </B>environment is a
complex one. While Australia's environment remains one of the major
motivational factors for domestic and international travel in<B> </B>Australia,
it is essential that increased tourism is accompanied by proper care and
management of sensitive areas and that environmental concerns are not
ignored for short-term profit. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Recognition by both environmental and tourism interests that the two
can be compatible can assist the sustainability of each in the long
term. The economic importance of tourism to Australia and the need to
maintain the tourism product has led to increased attention being paid
to sustainable tourism practices and, hence, to environmental
conservation.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Because of increased environmental awareness both at home and
abroad, governments, as well as industry, are taking responsibility for
regulating tourism development. Australia is a signatory to a number of
international treaties which also have implications for tourism
development, for example, the Antarctic Treaty System (which includes
the Antarctic Treaty and Protocol on Environment Protection) and the
World Heritage Convention.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The principles of environmentally sustainable development in tourism
are recognised by the Federal Government in the National Tourism
Strategy, the National Ecotourism Strategy and various policies
developed in conjunction with State and Territory Governments. These
principles also underpin government programs such as the National
Ecotourism Program, the Sites of National Tourism Significance Program,
and the Forest Ecotourism Program. Tourism industry associations such as
Pacific Asia Travel Association and Tourism Council Australia (TCA),
formerly Australian Tourism Industry Association, also have developed
environmental codes.</P>
<P></P>
<P>At the same time, the relatively low concentration of tourists<B></B>in
most rural areas means that many of the negative aspects of large scale
tourism development--greater pressure on services and infrastructure,
environmental stress and upward pressure on prices--can be avoided,
provided adequate resources are available.</P>
<P></P>
<P>An element of rural tourism is travelling in the countryside.<B></B>This
aspect<B> </B>can help to disperse visitor loads and spread tourism
across a variety of sites by developing<B> </B>recognised touring
routes. A good example of this is the Matilda Highway in outback
Queensland, mentioned above, where motorists are encouraged to stop and
see a range of outback scenery, pioneering history, sheep stations and
cattle properties, fossil sites, gemfields and ancient Aboriginal sites.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism may add value to land that might otherwise have been
used solely for agricultural purposes. This will further encourage
landholders to protect and preserve their properties through careful
land management and conservation practices and involvement in movements
such as Community<B> </B>Landcare, a Federal Government initiative,
administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, to
assist land, water and related vegetation projects.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>While Landcare's main objective is to preserve and sustain the rural
environment, it also fulfils an important educational function by
providing people from all walks of life, including visitors from
overseas, with an opportunity to participate in environmental
conservation. The recent advent of educational tour groups, including
international groups with farming interests, to areas where Landcare
practices are being followed, is becoming an important medium for
conveying Australia's conservation ethics and practices to the rest of
the world. Technical visits to farming areas, sometimes known as
agritourism, also have some general benefits in terms of the dollars
spent by the tour groups and the opportunity to expose the visitors to
other tourism locations and experiences.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Social benefits</P>
<P></P>
<P>The social impacts of tourism, whether from tourism infrastructure
or the tourists themselves, affect Australians in their communities.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The positive social impacts of tourism can be significant provided
the appropriate community consultative, educative and information
processes are followed. They can include:</P>
<UL><LI>a sense of community pride where residents consider the
attention of tourists to be indicative of their town's or area's
natural, cultural or historical attractiveness. This can lead to more
positive perceptions of tourism impacts and encourage new ideas and
initiatives to develop and manage tourism growth;</LI>
<LI>the maintenance of, and possible increases in, rural and regional
populations due to the decentralisation of tourism. Tourism jobs
accompanied by appropriate education and training programs may encourage
people to stay on in rural areas, thus contributing to local community
stability and sustainability;</LI>
<LI>a reduction in the isolation felt by many rural communities and the
opportunity for individuals to broaden their horizons by meeting new
people, particularly when there is direct personal contact between
tourists and hosts, as is more common in rural areas;</LI>
<LI>enhancement of lifestyle through the development of visitor
facilities and services which can also be enjoyed by the local
community;</LI>
<LI>the economic prosperity of a region generated by the extra income
derived from tourism, the circulation of which through the community can
act as a buffer against highs and lows of rural economies and hence
against reduced income cycles and their consequent social impacts; </LI>
<LI>the maintenance and enhancement of the cultural attributes of a
community through the preservation, development, interpretation and
promotion of traditional arts and crafts, heritage, rural industry and
lifestyles; and</LI>
<LI>the maintenance of environmental integrity, for example, visitor
expenditure being used for environmental preservation.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>It is important to gauge tourism's social impacts on a community so
that negative impacts, where possible, can be avoided, alleviated or
overcome. Unwanted effects could include: </P>
<UL><LI>disruption to daily life owing to invasion of privacy,
including invasion of traditional community events and activities
causing loss of heritage; traffic congestion and overcrowding;</LI>
<LI>cost burdens on local councils to meet the needs of non-residents;<B>
</B></LI>
<LI>site use conflicts where tourism developments may adversely affect
community leisure and recreation opportunities, and where, for example,
local sports facilities may become congested and overpriced;</LI>
<LI>environmental degradation as a result of exceeding carrying
capacities;</LI>
<LI>increased prices of facilities, food and services making these more
expensive than elsewhere and thus out of reach of the local community;</LI>
<LI>rent increases, accommodation shortages, inflated real estate
values and high council rates; and</LI>
<LI>the perception of increased crime rates due to the presence of
tourism.</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>Many of these negative effects can be minimised or even avoided if,
in the initial stages of planning tourism development, a community
consultation process is put in place and<B> </B>community perspectives
are obtained.<B></B></P>
<P><B></B>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC6">2.2 Challenges
</A></H2>
<P>Tourism's advantages to an area can greatly outweigh its
disadvantages. Tourism management policies at the local and regional
level which place a high priority on integrated strategic planning and
community participation can successfully alleviate potential
environmental and social problems. (One of the programs administered by
the Department of Tourism, the Regional Tourism Development Program, is
specifically designed to address the issue of strategic planning at the
local and regional levels.)<B></B></P>
<P><B></B></P>
<P>The need for careful assessment of an area's potential as a tourism
destination is an essential first step.</P>
<P>Tourism is, of course, not for every rural community. It should not
be regarded as a quick-fix for all economic ills. Factors such as long
distances from major gateways, poor scenic attractions and lack of
tourism infrastructure can mean that rural tourism may not be
appropriate for a particular region. Even communities that have the
physical assets may rightly choose not to develop tourism if they
perceive the costs to outweigh the potential benefits. Tourism is only
one option for diversification. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural Australia currently offers tourism products that are diverse,
of good quality and have the potential to satisfy the growing demand for
a `country experience'. At a time when international competition for the
travel dollar is growing, the challenge for Australians is to capitalise
on Australia's natural advantages. There is a need to continue to
improve and better package tourism products and to develop new products
responsive to shifts in market demand.
</P>
<H1><A NAME="RTFToC7">CHAPTER 3 WHY HAVE A NATIONAL RURAL TOURISM
STRATEGY?
</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC8">3.1 tourism facts and figures
</A></H2>
<P>Tourism in the world economy</P>
<P></P>
<P>Tourism is one of the world's most economically significant
industries. Despite a global economic downturn, tourism worldwide
continues to be one of the few industries showing solid growth.</P>
<P>The World Tourism Organisation estimates that, in 1993, world
tourism receipts (excluding international transport receipts) increased
by 9.3 per cent to $US 324 billion.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that, in the same
year, the industry employed around 127 million people worldwide,
representing 7 per cent of all jobs.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In 1993, international tourist arrivals at borders around the world
increased by 4 per cent to 500 million. The East Asia and Pacific region
was the fastest growing region, with arrivals up 12 per cent in 1993 to
68.5 million. It accounted for 14 per cent of all world arrivals. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Tourism in Australia</P>
<P></P>
<P>Tourism is one of Australia's fastest growing and most economically
significant industries. In 1991-92, the industry contributed around 5.6
per cent to Gross Domestic Product. </P>
<P></P>
<P>In 1993-94, international tourism to Australia generated export
earnings of $10.6 billion (up 15.4 per cent on 1992-93), accounting for
12 per cent of Australia's total export earnings. The industry is adding
an additional $1.4 billion to export earnings annually, around 26 per
cent of all export growth. If industry growth projections are realised,
tourism is expected to generate between $15 and $21 billion (1992
prices) annually in export earnings by the year 2000.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Over the last ten years, the number of overseas visitors has more
than trebled to a record 3 million in 1993. The BTR forecasts this
figure to increase to 4.8 million by the year 2000 while, for the same
year, the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) has set a marketing target
of 6.8 million visitors.</P>
<P>As a labour intensive industry, tourism offers considerable scope
for employment generation. In 1991-92, the industry accounted for around
467 000 jobs, either directly or indirectly, or 6.1 per cent of the work
force. Between 210&nbsp;000 and 270&nbsp;000 new jobs are expected to be
generated by the year 2000, at which time it is expected tourism will
employ around 8 per cent of the work force.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism in Australia</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism has been relatively unacknowledged as a tourism market
sector, yet estimates of domestic and international visitation to rural
areas are substantial.</P>
<P></P>
<P>As Figure 1 demonstrates, the proportion of domestic market share
attributable to rural and non-rural tourism appears to have remained
steady over the past nine years. Rural tourism in 1992-93 is estimated
to have accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the total domestic market.
It was estimated to be worth $11.2 billion to the Australian economy.</P>
<P></P>
<P>New South Wales and Queensland have the largest share of the rural
domestic tourism market (Figure 2). </P>
<P></P>
<P>Figure 3 again shows that, over the last nine years, rural tourism
has remained fairly static in the domestic market. However, the Tourism
Forecasting Council (TFC) predicts that domestic tourism will grow at an
average annual rate of around 2 per cent over the next six years (double
the annual growth rate achieved over the last decade) and rural tourism
is well placed to share in this growth. </P>
<P>The rural tourism industry is also expected to see strong growth
from the international market. Research undertaken by the ATC on
international visitors indicates that rural tourism experiences are
attractive to inbound tourists, with interest from the Asian region
steadily increasing. The ATC is currently focusing its rural tourism
marketing efforts in Asia on Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, which
show substantial potential for growth. In 1993, over 20 per cent of
overseas visitors sampled rural Australia, contributing an estimated
$1.2 billion to the rural economy. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Tourist expenditure (domestic and international) is contributing
significantly to regional economies. In New South Wales, for example,
all the ABS statistical regions showed a healthy increase in tourist
expenditure between 1988-89 and 1992-93: the Far Western region
escalated from $43 million to $55 million; the Hunter region from $403
million to $456 million; and the Murray region from $150 to $206 million
(NSW Tourism Commission, 1994). </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC9">3.2 Reasons for the National Rural Tourism
Strategy
</A></H2>
<P>One way of furthering the Federal Government's broad commitment to
regional development is through the development of rural tourism. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Following on from the initial identification of farm and rural
tourism in the National Tourism Strategy, the National Rural Tourism
Strategy provides the framework for its development. As such, it is
complementary to other Government tourism policy initiatives, namely,
the National Ecotourism Strategy (released in March 1994), the proposed
National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tourism Strategy, the
Backpacker Strategic Plan and the Cruise Shipping Strategy (both due for
release in early 1995).</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Federal Government believes that an overall policy framework for
the planning, development and management of rural tourism is fundamental
to optimising the benefits tourism offers.<B> </B>The National Rural
Tourism Strategy provides a basis for rural tourism policy formulation
and planning for both government and industry.</P>
<P></P>
<P>By acting as a catalyst in developing rural tourism as part of wider
regional development initiatives, the Federal Government intends to
provide a focus and direction for rural tourism development that will
achieve economic, environmental and social gains nationally. </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC10">3.3 The strategy development process
</A></H2>
<P>The National Tourism Strategy</P>
<P></P>
<P>The National Tourism Strategy, released by the Federal Government in
June 1992, identifies special interest tourism as an area of significant
potential and one through which the international tourism
competitiveness of Australia can be maintained. It states: </P>
<P></P>
<P>While farm tourism is growing in many regional areas, the market is
largely untapped and the challenge to industry operators is to
coordinate the sector's future development. There is a need to establish
accommodation and service standards, develop a well-planned national
marketing program and reservation network and provide tourism
educational and business advisory services to the rural sector (<I>Tourism,
Australia's Passport to Growth,</I> p. 85).</P>
<P></P>
<P>These developmental needs apply as much to other areas of the rural
tourism sector as they do to farm-based rural tourism.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural Tourism Discussion Paper</P>
<P><I></I></P>
<P><I>Tourism Discussion Paper No. 1--Rural Tourism</I>, released in
January 1993, examined the growth potential of the rural sector in terms
of domestic and international interests, covering such issues as
research priorities, standards, marketing, education, transport and
infrastructure, local government regulations, industry coordination,
business development and regional planning. Comments on the paper were
received from government departments, industry operators and
associations, local governments, community groups and educational
institutions (a list of respondents is at Appendix&nbsp;A). The
responses highlighted the need for greater integration of planning at
the regional level and more coordinated marketing efforts to diversify
the economic base in regional communities and provide jobs. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural Tourism Focus Group</P>
<P></P>
<P>To facilitate further discussion of the paper and help set a
framework for the development of the National Rural Tourism Strategy, a
focus group was convened by the Department of Tourism in early 1993. It
comprised people with expertise in rural tourism, including industry and
government representatives (a list of group members is at Appendix B).
Many of the projects funded under the Rural Tourism Program (RTP) in
1993-94 were a result of issues discussed at a meeting of the Rural
Tourism Focus Group in October 1993. These included industry
development, education and training, cooperative marketing, market
research and analysis, and product development through demonstration
projects.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Needs analysis consultancy on the rural tourism sector</P>
<P></P>
<P>Australian Farm and Country Tourism Inc. (AFACT) was granted Federal
Government funding in 1993-94 to engage a consultancy to take a critical
look at rural tourism, define and analyse impediments to its growth, and
suggest practical measures to address them. Key outcomes and
recommendations of the consultancy, conducted by Australian Rural
Management Services Pty Ltd from August to October 1994, have been
incorporated into the Strategy.

<H1><A NAME="RTFToC11">CHAPTER 4 RURAL TOURISM PARTICIPANTS
</A></H1>
<P>In creating an overall policy framework for rural tourism, it is
important to note the various stakeholders and how they are linked. The
interests of tourists, tourist operators and their host communities are
necessarily interwoven with the interests and efforts of a large number
of other parties.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Although responsibility for developing rural tourism lies largely
with industry, government at all levels can exert considerable influence
on the tourism environment. The role of governments is explained in more
detail in section 4.2. </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC12">4.1 Stakeholders
</A></H2>
<P>The stakeholders in rural tourism are many and varied. The degree to
which they participate in, and benefit from, the industry reflects the
extent and diversity of the product itself. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Today's <B>tourists</B> have greater spending power and more
leisure time. They are increasingly travel literate and environmentally
aware, they want to identify with the people and culture of a country,
and they want greater variety and better value for money. </P>
<P></P>
<P>In developing rural tourism it is important to ensure that visitors,
when making their travel decisions, are aware of the full range of rural
tourism products and experiences available. Likewise, it is important
for industry to be aware of the factors that influence domestic and
international travellers in their choice of a holiday destination and
that rural tourism products are developed, packaged and marketed to take
account of these preferences. </P>
<P><B></B></P>
<P><B>Private operators</B> have prime responsibility for supplying
suitable rural tourism product. Operators range from the large inbound
tourism businesses to the smaller specialist agricultural tour groups;
the rural accommodation sector which includes farm-host, bed and
breakfast, country motel, hotel, caravan park and rural resort
operators; the rural tourism attraction and adventure tour operations;
and organisers of country events and festivals. </P>
<P></P>
<P>To succeed in the industry, operators need to consider factors such
as the uniqueness of their product; its suitability for tourism
purposes; its development, packaging and marketing; its price; the
markets (both domestic and international) that can be targeted most
profitably and their needs; and the competitive advantage that can be
achieved and maintained over other suppliers, including overseas
operators. Also important is a knowledge of the structure and
functioning of the tourism industry, the operator's business skills and
tourism training, the pursuit and maintenance of standards and reliable
service and, where appropriate, industry coordination, particularly on a
regional basis. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The support of <B>host communities</B> can be essential to the
successful development of rural tourism. Community involvement is seen
as particularly important with the integration of tourism into local and
regional development programs becoming an essential component of an
area's overall economic development. Also important is that the host
community itself is often a vital part of the rural tourism `product'.</P>
<P><I></I></P>
<P><I>AussieHost</I>, a national program which has been assisted by
the Federal Government, has been designed to increase awareness of the
importance of tourism to Australia. It deals with developing and
improving customer-service skills, and has been embraced by rural
communities around Australia.</P>
<P><B></B></P>
<P><B>Tourism industry bodies</B> which operate at local, regional,
State and national spheres are important players in the growth of the
rural tourism sector. Issues such as industry leadership and
organisation, product development, education and training, marketing,
accreditation and standards are best managed and driven by industry
itself.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Tourism industry bodies involved in rural tourism include:</P>
<UL><LI>Australian Farm and Country Tourism Inc. (AFACT) which is the
national peak industry body for farm and country tourism;</LI>
<LI>Tourism Council Australia (TCA) which, in line with government
moves to support regional development, has established a National
Committee on Regional Tourism to investigate opportunities for
developing a National Regional Tourism Strategy; and</LI>
<LI>Inbound Tour Operators of Australia (ITOA) which brings tour groups
to country Australia and is responsible for introducing the <I>AussieHost
</I>program.</LI></UL>
<P><B></B></P>
<P><B>Non-tourism industry bodies</B> are also involved in the
industry. For example, the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) is
examining ways of refining its current accommodation classification
system to encompass alternate accommodation such as farm-host
properties, bed and breakfast accommodation, and country retreats. </P>
<P></P>
<P>There are also some specifically `rural' industries which are
benefiting from the interaction of agriculture and tourism. The
Australian Rice Growers' Cooperative in Leeton, part of the Murrumbidgee
Irrigation Area, has established a rice interpretation centre which
caters for special interest and technical tours, and is favoured by
Japanese visitors. Apart from visits to rice farms to study current rice
research and technology, a major drawcard is meeting the people and
experiencing genuine Australian country hospitality. The region as a
whole benefits from the `rice' tourists who may stay in the nearby towns
of Narrandera and Griffith and visit other rural attractions in the
vicinity such as fruit growing operations and wineries.</P>
<P><B></B></P>
<P><B>Transport operators</B> (airline, coach, rail, road and ferry)
stand to gain from, and can assist the growth of, rural tourism. The
provision of efficient, competitively priced and high quality transport
which gives easy access to country tourism markets is essential to meet
the high travel demands of consumers, particularly those from overseas.</P>
<P><B></B></P>
<P><B>Educational institutions,</B> including universities and
colleges of technical and further education (TAFEs), perform an
important role in developing rural tourism through both research and the
provision of training and course work. Tourism Training Australia (TTA)
has responsibility for coordinating developments in tourism training.
Information on higher education institutions which offer tourism courses
are listed in Beck and Richardson's (1993) <I>Tourism Education
Directory</I> <I>1994</I>.</P>
<P><B></B></P>
<P><B>Financial institutions</B> are an important avenue of assistance
for rural tourism enterprises. In the past, assistance for tourism as a
whole was not always forthcoming because lending institutions were
reluctant to fund what was commonly perceived as a risky industry (if,
in fact, it was even recognised as an industry in the first place given
its intangible nature). Progress has been made towards a better
understanding of each other's needs with the production of such
publications as the Australian Bankers'Association's <I>The Business of
Tourism --A Financial Management Guide for Tourism-based Businesses
</I>(1993).<I></I></P>
<P><I></I></P>
<P>Although not a stakeholder, the <B>media</B> plays an important
role in presenting the case for rural tourism and the opportunities it
offers communities willing to treat the industry as a serious
undertaking, on a par with agriculture. Of particular importance are the
specifically rural-based media such as the nationally televised <I>Cross
Countr</I>y program and the more locally-based newspapers, radio and
television networks which can all help to increase awareness of rural
tourism at the grassroots level.<B></B></P>
<P><B></B>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC13">4.2 The role of governments
</A></H2>
<P>The primary responsibility for developing rural tourism lies with
private sector operators themselves, although it is recognised that the
responsibilities in many areas are shared with other stakeholders,
including government. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Research and planning are conducted at all levels of government to
help industry achieve a balance between the supply of tourism product
and the likely growth in demand. The Federal Government through, for
example, its Regional Tourist Development Program, encourages integrated
tourism planning at the regional level and, through this and other
programs, assists the development and modelling of appropriate
infrastructure.</P>
<P></P>
<P>While there will always be areas of industry activity that require
government intervention through legislation or regulation, the Federal
Government seeks to encourage the tourism industry to develop
self-regulation and accreditation as preferred options wherever these
can be successfully implemented.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Governments provide incentives and support through small business
enterprise development programs, financial assistance through the
Commonwealth Development Bank, depreciation and development allowances,
and support of demonstration projects and best practice programs. In
addition, government agencies provide business advice.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Governments are also involved through their partial subsidisation of
the costs of production wherein they provide infrastructure or invest
public money<B></B>for development from which the private sector
ultimately derives a benefit.<B> </B>The provision of infrastructure
and education and training via government bodies can give impetus for
tourism growth. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The McKinsey Report (1994b, p. 94) sees governments, as `change
leaders' and describes the role of governments as `to act as facilitator
and to help businesses perform ... This includes increasing the number
of opportunities available to businesses, relieving bottlenecks,
structuring incentives and building skills'. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Federal Government</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Minister for Tourism, the Hon Michael Lee MP, in a speech to the
ATIA Tourism Conference held September 1994 in Adelaide, talked about
four vital areas where the Federal Government is concentrating its
tourism effort:</P>
<UL><LI>setting the framework to allow the industry to prosper and
getting the fundamentals right (which includes floating the dollar;
introducing enterprise bargaining; reforming aviation with deregulation
of domestic airways--fares are 25 per cent lower than they were in 1990
and 50 per cent more people now travel by air; and allowing depreciation
provisions through the taxation system);</LI>
<LI>increasing awareness of the importance of tourism (both the
National Tourism Strategy and the National Ecotourism Strategy have
received international acclaim);</LI>
<LI>addressing market failures (by providing a package of programs
totalling over $42 million over four years aimed at spreading the
economic and employment benefits of tourism growth, with emphasis on
rural and regional Australia--this package includes the Rural Tourism
Program); and</LI>
<LI>providing information for the industry (through the BTR, and the
newly-formed TFC which provides activity forecasts to guide new
investment in infrastructure, and through publication of the new <I>Tourism
Assistance Guide: Commonwealth Government Programs and Initiatives for
the Tourism Industry,
</I>a comprehensive directory of federal initiatives for the tourism
industry. The guide is a useful reference for tourism operators,
consultants and associations, State, Territory and local Government
authorities, and people planning to start a tourism business. A free
copy can be obtained by contacting the Department of Tourism's
Information Officer on 008 804 465 or by fax on (06)&nbsp;248&nbsp;0734).</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>In addition, a key priority for Federal Government involvement in
tourism is the marketing of Australia overseas. The ATC, a statutory
authority administered under the provisions of the <I>Australian
Tourist Commission Act 1987, </I>received an appropriation of $77.817
million in the 1993-94 Budget, including $2 million for the
implementation of Partnership Australia. Additional funding of $290 000
was also provided to the ATC, in 1993-94, under the Rural Tourism
Program.</P>
<P></P>
<P>State and Territory Governments</P>
<P></P>
<P>While the Federal Government has prime responsibility for marketing
tourism internationally (through the ATC) and for setting and
implementing policies at a national level (through the Department of
Tourism in Canberra), State and Territory tourism authorities have prime
responsibility for promoting and marketing of State attractions and
developing specific tourist facilities. Cooperation amongst governments
is highlighted in the Partnership Australia initiative which aims to
market Australia more effectively overseas by combining some of the
planning and financial resources of the ATC and the State and Territory
tourism authorities. Federal Government programs are set out in Appendix
C and a summary of State and Territory initiatives and contact officers
is in Appendix D.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Local governments</P>
<P></P>
<P>Local governments are particularly important in facilitating rural
tourism, given their closeness to the rural communities. While local
governments focus on providing and maintaining infrastructure and public
facilities for their rate payers, many councils strongly support their
local tourism industry, often being the major funding sources for
tourist associations, visitor centres and caravan parks.<B> </B>Integrated
local area planning, based on proper consideration of all relevant
aspects of development, environment quality and service provision,
facilitates the best use of local resources.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The role of local government is discussed in more detail in section
6.9.
</P>
<H1><A NAME="RTFToC14">CHAPTER 5 FACTORS AFFECTING RURAL TOURISM
</A></H1> 
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC15">5.1 Development opportunities for rural tourism
</A></H2>
<P>In Australia, agricultural employment has decreased as a result of
falling farm incomes and technological change. This, in turn, has
resulted in a decrease in rural services such as professional services,
shops, educational institutions and transportation. There is a
recognised need for diversification if rural areas are to survive, let
alone prosper. Introducing tourism is sometimes a solution. A working
farm, for example, might accept paying guests who participate in work on
the farm or simply observe farm life. Part-time employment in the rural
tourism industry, such as casual bar work or sales to tourists, can also
supplement the major income source. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Few barriers to entry mean that it is easy for new businesses to
establish themselves, though this can mean that people enter tourism
without the necessary planning, skills or financial backing.</P>
<P>The typical small size<B> </B>of many rural tourism enterprises can
lead to a desirable concentration on niche marketing. Farm stays are a
case in point which often use these tactics to sell the `hosted
experience' to small groups of visitors. The propensity to service small
groups of people or individuals fits well with the upsurge of free and
independent travellers coming to Australia, as reported by the ATC.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To maximise the impact of their products in the marketplace,
operators will generally need to cooperatively market with other `like'
products, for example, farm stays at regional, state and/or national
level. Similarly, operators with complementary product within regions
should combine to market the diversity of experiences in the regions,
thereby increasing the attractiveness of the area to the visitor.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Trends</P>
<P></P>
<P>Current tourism trends are generally favourable to rural tourism. In
<I>Tourism Strategies and Rural Development</I>, a discussion paper
prepared for the OECD, a number of factors are identified as being
responsible for the growth in rural tourism overseas. These factors are
applicable to Australia and include:</P>
<P>	an increase in leisure time, disposable income and a tendency to
short breaks (although in Australia, short breaks can restrict trips to
easily accessible destinations);</P>
<P>	higher levels of education which bode well for rural tourism as
`research shows that increasing levels of education correlate with
increased interest in outdoor recreation, ecotourism and special
interest holidays';</P>
<P>	a rise in popularity of `green' issues: rural holidays, though not
necessarily environmentally focused, are perceived as wholesome.
Nature-based tours and those with a defined educational and
interpretative content managed in an environmentally sustainable way
(ecotourism) are enjoying popularity;<B></B></P>
<UL><LI>a growing interest in speciality food and beverages, which can
feature `clean-green' rural produce;</LI>
<LI>a greater appreciation of heritage, both built and natural;</LI>
<LI>the search for authenticity in a material world which rural
holidays can provide, assisted by dealings with friendly locals;</LI>
<LI>the need for peace and tranquillity, particularly as a stress
reducer;</LI>
<LI>the ageing of an active population, with the time, money and
inclination to travel widely, often choosing rural holidays for health
reasons, to discover non-urban experiences or to recapture youthful
times spent in the country;</LI>
<LI>health consciousness--leading to more active outdoor recreation,
encouraged by better outdoor clothing;</LI>
<LI>the recognised emergence of REAL travel (rewarding, enriching,
adventuresome and a learning experience) often linked with
individualism;</LI>
<LI>improvement in transport and communications (though distances in
Australia can be formidable in terms of time and cost); and</LI>
<LI>increasing participation by rural agencies such as those involved
with national parks, arts and crafts, community welfare, economic
development and transport, in encouraging and developing rural tourism.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>Coates (1991) and Kusler (1992) suggest further trends that are
shaping the relationship between tourism and the natural environment,
including:</P>
<UL><LI>new demographic groups such as two-income households and baby
boomers reaching the peak of their earning capacity;</LI>
<LI>increased exposure to new and remote places through the media;</LI>
<LI>increased attention to indigenous and cultural tourism; and</LI>
<LI>increased concern about crowding at existing destinations.</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>Whether rural tourism can capitalise on these trends, and to what
extent, will depend largely on the initiative, commitment and
professionalism of rural tourism operators. In turn, tourism operators
will require the support of strong industry associations, an
enthusiastic and cooperative local community, and appropriate government
policies and programs. </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC16">5.2 Overcoming impediments to rural tourism
development
</A></H2>
<P>There are impediments to rural tourism development which need to be
addressed. These range from community inexperience and inertia to a lack
of professional and business expertise among operators, industry
fragmentation, distance and a lack of infrastructure.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Community participation</P>
<P></P>
<P>Community participation and support is an important part of
considering the suitability of tourism as an industry for an area. It
can prove worthwhile, both in the short and long term.</P>
<P>In some cases, communities may not wish to pursue tourism
development. Other communities, however, will wish to assess what their
areas have to offer tourists and, in return, what tourism has to offer
their community. Manuals have been produced to guide community groups
through this process, as well as programs such as <I>Mainstreet</I>, a
community-based program to improve the business activities in key areas.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>Care must be taken to assess realistically an area's appeal for
travellers, including ease of access. The remoteness and isolation of an
area can deter some tourists (owing to time and cost constraints and
other factors), although, paradoxically, others will want to visit an
area for these very reasons. </P>
<P>While some tourists do not regard the journey as part of the holiday
experience, `touring' to others is an important element of getting out
into the country. As a marketing tool, and to overcome distance
limitations, the travel itself can be made a part of the total rural
tourism `experience'. Taking `the track' from Alice Springs to Darwin
(the Stuart Highway in the Northern Territory) and stopping at
identified places of interest along the way can be as much an
`experience' as it is a means of getting from one place to another. In
this way an impediment can be turned into an asset.</P>
<P></P>
<P>It is necessary to compare an area's tourism appeal with that of
other regions. While civic pride can lead people to think their area has
great products to offer, an unrealistic appraisal of tourism assets can
result in a waste of resources. Should a community decide to promote
tourism, it must find ways to help itself establish and develop this
industry. In developing rural tourism, communities should:</P>
<UL><LI>take advantage of existing assets (scenery, historic
buildings);</LI>
<LI>maintain any competitive advantages; and</LI>
<LI>target suitable markets.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>In establishing tourism, it is essential to have leadership.
Sometimes, a small group of committed people may perform this role.
Often, planners and professionals already employed in the community
become the leaders, injecting enthusiasm tempered with realism into
investigation of the potential of tourism.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Sometimes, communities will be lucky enough to have people with
appropriate skills, necessary for tourism development, in their midst.
Using local resources (people and goods) helps to bolster a region's
economy. The necessary skills for operating successful tourism
enterprises (e.g. marketing) may not, however, be freely available
within the community. If the skills are not present in the local
community, then they will either have to be developed or paid for.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Operators and the rural tourism industry</P>
<P></P>
<P>It is generally agreed that small business makes up 70 to 80 per
cent of businesses in the tourism industry. The majority of these small
businesses are scattered across rural Australia, sometimes as members of
an umbrella industry organisation. Small businesses have a high failure
rate: some 80 per cent of new businesses fail in their first two years
of operation and, of the remainder, only one-third are still operating
after ten years (New South Wales Small Business Advisory Centre). One
way to keep rural tourism operators in business is to improve their
overall business skills.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The commonly used example is that of a farmer diversifying into farm
hosting. While the farmer knows about agriculture, he or she will need
to acquire tourism expertise if the secondary business is to do well.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>The lack of profitability in some segments of the industry can
impede development. Sometimes, individual businesses that would not be
profitable on their own are able to succeed by uniting with others in
the region to offer package deals combining products such as transport,
accommodation, attractions and activities. Often, networking can allow
business to be spread across a region. It is important to remember that
a business's major competitor is often not what is offered down the road
but what is available in a region perhaps some 1000 kilometres away.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The small, diverse, scattered nature of rural tourism operations can
make it difficult to have a united industry presence. To overcome this
industry fragmentation, there is a strong need for cooperation and
collaboration across all levels of government and industry sectors in
forming and executing tourism plans. This is particularly important at
the local government level, concerned as it is with community
involvement and the integration of tourism with other regional planning.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Other businesses and industries</P>
<P></P>
<P>The business of rural tourism affects, and is dependent on, other
types of businesses and enterprises. Visitors to rural Australia expect
to be able to get fuel and vehicle repairs, buy basic foodstuffs, dine
at cafes and restaurants of an acceptable standard and find decent
accommodation. Tourism operators, communities and other services in
country towns need to recognise their shared dependency. By working
together, they can develop and present an inviting environment for the
visitor for mutual benefit.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Several submissions to <I>Tourism Discussion Paper No. 1-- Rural
Tourism</I> commented that financial institutions did not like to lend
for rural tourism ventures. When they did (it was reported), loans
failed to be structured to suit the cash flow and payment ability of
rural tourism operators. The needs analysis consultancy examining rural
tourism found a different situation: financial institutions were lending
to tourism businesses if those businesses could submit strong business
plans. Through the TFC and by working with the Australian Bankers'
Association, the Federal Government is seeking to further improve the
climate for financial institutions' involvement in the tourism industry
and to prepare tourism operators better for the financial obligations of
running a tourism business.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Whatever the opportunities and impediments, it is important that a
holistic approach be taken to rural tourism development which involves
strategic planning and an integrated approach to development in country
areas as a whole. Essential to achieving the correct balance is the
`bottom up' approach where communities participate in the planning
process at every stage. This ensures that development is not imposed
from outside and that those who live in rural Australia are committed
to, and participate in, the development of rural tourism.</P>
<P></P>
<H1><A NAME="RTFToC17">CHAPTER 6 KEY ISSUES, STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS
</A></H1> 
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC18">6.1 Future directions for rural tourism
</A></H2>
<P>This section examines the issues that must be addressed in
developing rural tourism, as identified by public submissions, the Rural
Tourism Focus Group and the needs analysis consultancy. It raises issues
in the following areas: </P>
<UL><LI>product and enterprise development;</LI>
<LI>accreditation and industry standards;</LI>
<LI>education and training;</LI>
<LI>marketing;</LI>
<LI>market analysis;</LI>
<LI>industry leadership;</LI>
<LI>transport and infrastructure; and </LI>
<LI>the role of local government.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>Strategies and actions to address these issues are proposed. </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC19">6.2 Product and enterprise development 
</A></H2>
<P>Product refers to the actual product (or service) being offered. In
the case of rural tourism, it is the total `country experience'. Product
is a combination of the bricks and mortar, the activities, the
atmosphere and the part played by the host. It is what the traveller has
paid for and constitutes his or her memories of a good or bad tourism
experience. Good experiences will be rewarded by other visits; bad
experiences recounted to many with whom the traveller comes into
contact. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Product development, incorporating business development, is
essential for a healthy, sustainable and prosperous industry in that it
lifts industry standards, increases the range of attractions available
to visitors and is able to sustain growth. Because of the competitive
nature of the tourism industry, what Australia offers tourists must be
unique and of a standard commensurate with the rest of the world.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Good product development will be achieved through measures such as:</P>
<UL><LI>identification of major and ancillary attractions and their
inclusion in regional packaging. For example, a package for Kangaroo
Island, South Australia, includes sea/air transport, local touring
opportunities and specific activities such as scuba diving;</LI>
<LI>recognition of the expectations and needs of tourists and the
appropriate creation and modification of product. For example, the New
England Development Board in New South Wales is integrating different
tourism and business aspects in the areas of agriculture, education and
Aboriginal culture to expand the tourism product being offered in the
region. Australia-wide, the Australian Hotels Association, in a bid to
turn hotels into safe, friendly establishments for families, is
introducing child-minding and outdoor playgrounds to encourage stays by
more families;</LI>
<LI>value-adding to tourist products or other types of products (for
example, the Hamilton Sheep Centre, Tasmania, which was purpose-built to
cater for the Japanese coach market, is now having wool grown on the
property knitted into up-market pullovers for sale as souvenirs at the
Centre); and</LI>
<LI>competitiveness (perhaps through offering superior product, paying
attention to price, and/or tailoring promotion to suit the clientele).</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>In addition, cooperative networks amongst operators with similar
products can result in access to larger markets. The practice of
farm-stay and bed and breakfast operators banding together to
accommodate large coach groups needs to be accepted as regular business
practice by a greater number of operators.<B></B>Interaction with other
businesses in assembling suitable tour packages incorporating
accommodation, attractions, transport, restaurants and retail outlets
can provide a better product for inbound tour operators. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The needs analysis consultancy into rural tourism noted the need for
different types of packages: </P>
<UL><LI>theme-based packages, for example, tours of unusual farming
enterprises such as historical farms (Clydesdales, antique machinery,
etc.), aquaculture enterprises (yabby farm, trout farm, etc.), alpaca
studs and emu farms;</LI>
<LI>complementary packages featuring a combination of rural product
because of some spatial, logical or transport connection (for example,
in Victoria, operators and Tourism Victoria are working cooperatively to
promote a travel circuit encompassing the Great Ocean Road, the
Grampians and the Goldfields, a trip which usually takes at least three
days); and</LI>
<LI>packaging specifically for wholesalers' programs (for example,
AFACT's international marketing program targeting South-East Asia).</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>The consultancy also discussed the development of landscape
packages, that is, providing visitors with information about an area
whether it be the cultural history, natural environment (land types,
vegetation and animal species, geology), farm systems (what is grown
where, how, seasonal occurrences), mining or local Aboriginal groups.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>The recognition of high quality product can provide examples of best
practice and inspire other operators to improve their businesses. State
government and industry tourism awards highlight the achievements of
excellence in tourism enterprises and set high standards for tourism's
development. In addition, TCA organises the Australian Tourism Awards to
recognise outstanding achievement in the travel, tourism hospitality and
leisure industries. In 1994, rural tourism winners included the Tjapukai
Dance Theatre (category of Significant Local Attractions); Manyallaluk
Tours (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tourism); Port Fairy Folk
Festival (Significant Local Festivals and Special Events); Kingfisher
Bay Resort &amp; Village (Environmental Tourism), Unforgettable
Houseboats (Specialist Accommodation) and Australian Bushman Tours (Tour
&amp; Transport Operators--National).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Enterprise development </P>
<P></P>
<P>The majority of operators in the rural tourism industry are small
businesses. As a result, the concerns of and constraints to small
business are also relevant to the rural tourism industry. Macro-economic
issues such as interest rates, inflation, taxation and government
charges, and growth within the national and local economy will continue
to be areas of concern for all small operators. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Advice on business matters is available from: </P>
<UL><LI>the small business network which has been instrumental in
improving the professionalism of small business operators within the
tourism industry;</LI>
<LI>regional economic and development organisations which, through
their incorporation of tourism into local economic development plans,
have also been instrumental in encouraging rural tourism growth;</LI>
<LI>regional tourism associations;</LI>
<LI>tourism industry associations; and/or</LI>
<LI>State and Territory tourism authorities.</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>The ATC also offers advice to new operators and to those seeking to
move or expand into a new market. The ATC's 1993 publication <I>International
Tourism Marketing Manual </I>is considered a vital tool for those
seeking information on the international market.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Besides these organisations, business assistance is available
through AusIndustry (located within the Commonwealth Department of
Industry, Science and Technology), the development of which was one of
the key industry assistance initiatives outlined in the Government's May
1994 White Paper
<I>Working Nation. </I>The establishment of AusIndustry has enabled
improved coordination and delivery of programs, bringing together under
a unified marketing structure all of the Federal Government's business
assistance programs.</P>
<P></P>
<P>AusIndustry includes:</P>
<P>	BusinessLink, a scheme whereby the Federal Government is working
cooperatively with State and Territory Governments to develop
computer-based information for small to medium-sized enterprises (it
will provide information about export services; tenders and other
business opportunities; finance; business assistance measures and
programs; technology and product information; licensing requirements;
taxation; industrial awards; management advice and training; and
industry assistance measures and services); and</P>
<P>	the National Industry Extension Service, which helps small and
medium-sized Australian firms in the manufacturing and services sectors
to become internationally competitive through enterprise improvement.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>Operators need to be aware that new tourism ventures or businesses
might not be profitable in their first few years, and cash deficiencies
might be experienced over a period. The Australian Bankers' Association
(ABA) has published <I>The Business of Tourism: A Financial Management
Guide for Tourism-based Businesses,
</I>which explains the process of formulating a successful loan proposal
and effectively managing the finances of a tourism business. It also
discusses many of the special problems that beset tourism operators and
suggests how to effectively manage these problems. This guide can be
obtained from the ABA by telephoning 008 033 652.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In seeking to develop their product, operators should avail
themselves of the business advice offered by small business centres,
regional tourism associations, regional economic development
organisations, tourism industry bodies and State/Territory tourism
authorities. Other sources of advice are facilitators/rural counsellors
under the Business Advice for Rural Areas (BARA) scheme and the Rural
Counselling Program (RCP), administered by the Commonwealth Department
of Primary Industries and Energy. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Under BARA, the Federal Government provides grants to rural
community groups to meet part of the costs of employing a business
facilitator. The facilitator helps rural communities to diversify,
stabilise and expand income opportunities by assisting local
entrepreneurial capacity, fostering business talent and ideas, and
improving individual and rural economic diversification. Under the RCP,
grants are offered to local community groups in rural areas experiencing
severe economic stress to assist with the employment of financial
counsellors who provide free, confidential financial advice.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Local communities also need to be able to access advice about the
prospects for tourism in their area. Sound consideration of tourism
development by community groups will involve a wide cross-section of the
community in a manner that is most likely to result in informed
discussion and debate. The communities will need to assess the potential
benefits and possible disadvantages that may accrue from tourism
development within their area. To this end, it may be useful to prepare
appropriate `how-to' material for communities that wish to develop
economic opportunities through tourism, and to do so in a manner that is
systematic, informed and most likely to lead to success. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Issues</P>
<P></P>
<P>The needs analysis consultancy recognised the benefits of self-help
and mutual aid being practised by some rural tourism operators. Through
these means, operators are able to learn about (and improve) their own
business by comparing themselves with others. The consultancy identified
enterprise best-practice workshops as a means of providing this product
development. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Similarly, the consultancy identified that in some regions
organisations involved in regional tourism development require a better
understanding of how successful tourism developments occur. It has been
suggested that `best practice' examples of rural tourism businesses
(farm stays, rural resorts, rural adventure holidays, rural attractions,
festivals and events, and nature-based tourism) could increase
understanding.</P>
<P></P>
<P>There are also a number of specific issues that prospective rural
tourism operators face in the development of product.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In some instances, government requirements in the areas of
transport, liquor licensing, health, food and hygiene may affect the
services offered by hosts to guests in the rural tourism environment.
The particular circumstances of smaller operations may not always have
been taken into account in the formulation of these requirements.
Operators need to be aware of the various requirements and mindful of
the penalties for non-compliance.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Insurance to cover both people and property can also be a source of
concern for some rural tourism enterprises. Operators of adventure
tours, farm stays offering horse riding as part of their package, and
owners of heritage buildings can find the high cost of insurance
premiums daunting, if in fact they can find a company willing to insure
them at all.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Many travellers now demand that operators offering white water
rafting, abseiling or other adventure sports possess appropriate
certificates or licences. Operators therefore need to have the
appropriate qualifications and must keep them up-to-date.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism operators should also be mindful of the recent High
Court decision and European consumer protection provisions giving
consumers access to compensation if the product is not provided as
advertised or the holiday fails to meet their expectations. Travel
agents and tour operators without professional indemnity insurance
should review the public liability insurance policies available.</P>
<P></P>
<P>STRATEGY: Encourage the sustainable development of high quality
tourism products and product variety in rural areas.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Actions </P>
<UL><LI>	Support diversity and quality in rural tourism product
development through measures such as developing and disseminating `how

<P></P>
<P>Funding has been provided under the RTP for discrete demonstration
projects (described below) promoting product development:</P>
<P></P>
<P>	(a) the development of astronomy tours in New South Wales which
will encourage the wider promotion and marketing of tourism facilities
associated with the astronomy centres at Narrabri, Coonabarabran,
Gilgandra, Parkes and Tidbinbilla together with other local tourist
attractions and facilities in each of these areas ($46&nbsp;000);</P>
<P></P>
<P>	(b) the development of farm tours in the Huon Valley, Tasmania, to
assist the development of a quality rural tourism product and
demonstrate how agricultural resources in rural areas can be diversified
($80&nbsp;000);</P>
<P></P>
<P>	(c) the installation of suitable communications technology at the
old repeater stations--initially Alice Springs, Barrow Creek, Tennant
Creek and Darwin (later Pine Creek and Newcastle Waters)--which will
simulate conditions and experiences of an earlier era. Visitors will be
able to use the facilities at these interpretative centres for sending
and receiving telegrams ($80&nbsp;000);</P>
<P></P>
<P>	(d) the creation of an assets register, conduct of perceptual
research and establishment of a marketing identity for the Swan Valley
in Western Australia ($40&nbsp;000); and</P>
<P></P>
<P>	(e) the development of a formal system of accreditation to ensure
that high standards of accommodation and professional service in farm
and country tourism can be recognised by both tourists and other tourism
operators ($75&nbsp;000).</P>
<P></P>
<P>These projects will have national applicability. It is planned that
a demonstration booklet will be compiled and distributed.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Funding of $30&nbsp;000 has been provided under the RTP for further
analysis of the ATC's international visitor segmentation studies to
identify target visitors specifically for rural tourism.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Results of the analysis will be available to rural tourism operators
to enable them to undertake appropriately focused improvements in
product development.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The RTP has also funded attitudinal case studies undertaken as part
of the recently conducted AFACT needs analysis consultancy into major
issues in rural tourism (total consultancy grant of $102&nbsp;000
provided). The results of these studies may lead to initiatives to
improve the general public's awareness of rural tourism.</P>

</UL>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC20">6.3 Accreditation and industry standards
</A></H2>
<P>Over the past decade, Australia's tourism industry has developed
rapidly. Not only has the number of tourists multiplied, but tourists
have become more sophisticated and discerning. This means that the
quality of the tourism product or `country experience' has become just
as important as its novelty or newness.</P>
<P></P>
<P>At a time when international competition for the tourism dollar is
growing and when many countries already have firmly established rural
tourism industries, it is imperative that Australia be able to compete
effectively in attracting visitors to rural areas. In Australia's case,
the impetus to offer the potential customer `that little bit extra' is
much stronger because of the difficulties (perceived or substantiated)
in travelling to this country owing to distance and cost.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A number of industry bodies are already investigating accreditation
in specific areas of the tourism industry. Current industry-wide tourism
accreditation and standards include the National Tourism Competency
Standards, ACCESS--the Hospitality Skills and Recognition Program, and
the Australian Travel Agent Qualification program. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Industry review panels such as the Tourism Training Review Panel and
the Australian Hospitality Review Panel, established through Tourism
Training Australia (TTA), are accreditation/recognition bodies that
primarily set standards and ensure courses seeking industry recognition
have the appropriate content, facilities and staff.</P>
<P></P>
<P>An accreditation scheme for professional guides has been introduced
by ITOA with Federal assistance. A Federal Government-funded (through
TCA), industry led steering committee is investigating a national
accreditation scheme for ecotourism operations. Standards for backpacker
hostels are also being examined through a consultancy being funded by
the Federal Government.</P>
<P>While all the above have implications for the rural tourism sector,
accreditation schemes currently being developed and implemented by the
Victorian Tourism Operators Association (VTOA) and by ITOA, in the form
of its AussieHost customer service program, touch more directly on the
sector's needs. The AAA is also considering developing a national
classification scheme for guest house, bed and breakfast, and host farm
accommodation. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The considerable number of accreditation programs and benchmarking
studies, either in use or being developed in the tourism industry, has
been discussed by the Australian Standing Committee on Tourism. As a
result, in October 1994, the committee initiated a working party,
including industry, to undertake an initial audit to investigate and
evaluate current programs, models and options.</P>
<P>The success of accreditation schemes will depend on how well
consumer expectations are satisfied. Such schemes might involve a cost
to the operator such as undertaking additional training or investing in
new infrastructure, but outlays are likely to be recouped through
increased length of stays and repeat visits over time.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Issues</P>
<P></P>
<P>The needs analysis consultancy noted that operators have
responsibilities to maintain high standards, and gave an example of an
operator attempting to contact a bed and breakfast in another region to
arrange a couple of days accommodation. Four establishments were
selected, and each was telephoned. At the first, there was no answer,
the second was answered by a young child, and the third had an answering
machine with different messages for two or three different businesses.
Finally, the fourth was answered by the operator. </P>
<P></P>
<P>In working to improve the capability of rural Australia to attract
international and domestic tourists, the development of service
excellence and professionalism in country areas is a priority. The
introduction of highly regarded national accreditation schemes for the
rural tourism sector could help to establish the reputation of Australia
as a high quality tourism destination.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In developing such schemes, whether through the modification of
established procedures to encompass the special requirements of rural
tourism operations or through the introduction of new schemes, a number
of factors need to be considered. These include:</P>
<UL><LI>an emphasis on the `experiential' factor of a farm stay, rural
tourism attraction or tour. The `hosting' component is the most
difficult area to evaluate as part of an accreditation scheme;</LI>
<LI>the need for operators to have a high level of commitment to
tourism (people operating tourism businesses primarily for motives other
than profit such as lifestyle choice would be less likely to be
attracted to the accreditation process);<I> </I></LI>
<LI>the need for a scheme that assists operators to reach minimum
standards and identify improvement opportunities in their business;</LI>
<LI>the importance of consumer feedback as part of the quality
assurance process and as a means of ensuring that operators respond to
the changing demands of the market;</LI>
<LI>the need for a scheme that rewards operators who are prepared to
invest in their business and provide high quality facilities and
hosting;</LI>
<LI>the need to cater for increasing environmental awareness of rural
tourism consumers through the introduction of environmental standards
and conservation practices;</LI>
<LI>the potential role and structure of educational programs to support
the introduction of an accreditation scheme. Training and accreditation
bodies such as TTA need to be consulted when developing and implementing
accreditation schemes; and</LI>
<LI>administration, including monitoring of new schemes, whether it be
by an independent and self-funded agency, possibly across all industry
sectors, or by some form of licensing by State authorities for business
operations and facilities.</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>STRATEGY: Support accreditation and introduction/recognition of
standards for rural tourism ventures.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Actions<B></B></P>
<UL><LI>	Encourage the development and implementation of industry
standards for rural tourism as a basis for industry self-regulation and
examine options for developing national rural tourism accreditation
schemes (industry associations, TTA, educational institutions, all
spheres of government).</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>Under the RTP, the Federal Government has provided funding for the
establishment of an Executive Officer position within the national
farm-host organisation, AFACT.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A major function of this position is to promote higher and
consistent standards through development and training, and to
investigate opportunities for accreditation in the farm-stay sector.</P>
<P>Under the RTP, funding of $75&nbsp;000 has been provided to VTOA for
a pilot project to develop appropriate accreditation standards for farm
and country tourism accommodation and services in Victoria.</P>
<P></P>

<TITLE>Regional Tourism Strategy - Chapter 6.4 to End</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BACKGROUND="/images/yellow_rock.gif"><H2><A NAME="RTFToC21">6.4 Education and training
</A></H2>
<P>According to research by TTA, many small business operators in
tourism have little or no experience either in hospitality or in small
business operation. If expected industry growth in country tourism over
the next decade is to be effectively harnessed, skills in these areas
will have to be developed and upgraded.</P>
<P></P>
<P>At the national level, TTA is the peak tourism industry training
body. It comprises government, industry and union representatives, and
is funded jointly by Federal and State/Territory Governments and the
industry. It was established to advise Governments and industry on
tourism training matters and works with a network of State and Territory
committees to develop and implement tourism training strategies. It
determines competency standards for the hospitality and tourism
industries and has completed the national competency standards for all
major sectors of the industry. TTA also develops resource material to
meet individual needs as well as community training needs.</P>
<P>A May 1992 report prepared for TTA, <I>Tourism 2000: Key Directions
for Human Resource Development</I>, identified and advised on critical
education and training issues. It also outlined a detailed plan to meet
language and cultural skills needs for growth in the Japan, Other Asia
and Other European markets. </P>
<P></P>
<P>State training plans are the main way of identifying training needs.
Almost every State/Territory in the Tourism Training Network produces a
training plan which identifies training needs across all sectors of the
industry. Victoria, for example, in developing its training plan for
1996-98 consulted a wide range of industry associations and identified
key areas for exploring new methods of delivering training, to encourage
greater participation in training amongst smaller tourism operators in
regional areas.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In planning for tourism training, the characteristics of the
industry have to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the tourism
industry is highly decentralised, a fact which is demonstrated on a
national basis with 56 per cent of all accommodation rooms being located
outside Australia's capital cities (ABS March 1994). As well, 80 per
cent of all tourism businesses employ fewer than 20 people (BTR 1990).
</P>
<P></P>
<P>Such small businesses often lack the staffing flexibility of larger
operations. The needs analysis consultancy found that lack of time to
attend formal training sessions was the key reason for owner/operators
not undertaking training. Special delivery mechanisms such as videos and
manual information kits, which recognise that rural tourism operators
are frequently in isolated regions where training resources (e.g. TAFEs)
are not easily accessible, can help to overcome these barriers. Such
packages also recognise that small tourism businesses are
seven-day-a-week operations and allow training to be self-paced and
flexible.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A number of business packages exist for rural tourism operators.
Tourism Training Victoria(TTV) has produced `Getting into Tourism'--a
video/manual information kit for intending, new and existing small
businesses. The Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation distributes
the `Getting Started' and `Getting Smarter' video series, self-help
education programs which highlight the important decisions to be
considered before establishing a new tourism business and how to improve
business practices once they are up and running. Small Business Victoria
has produced ten booklets in a tourism series including advertising,
feasibility studies and guidebooks dealing with Japanese visitors and a
rural tourism specific farm tourism guidebook. AFACT produces starter
kits for farm-stay operators. State and Territory tourism authorities
have other relevant publications also. The ATC provides information kits
and has published the <I>International Tourism Marketing Manual</I>.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To meet community needs there are a number of tools, including a
Training Needs Analysis Resources Kit being prepared by TTV, that will
enable areas to assess their own tourism training and educational needs.
Corowa, in New South Wales, has acted to improve business activities
through the <I>Mainstreet</I> program which recognises links between
town centre revitalisation, the attraction of new businesses and tourism
development. Other models, specifically for the use of local people in
the planning, development and marketing of local and regional tourism,
could be appropriate.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In 1990, TTA estimated that over 18 000 students were
undertaking tourism-related courses (certificate level or courses of one
or more years duration). Of these, three-quarters were doing hospitality
courses. </P>
<P></P>
<P>More general training in a number of subject areas is available
through industry seminars and conferences. For example, at the first
Rural Tourism Conference, held at the University of New England in
Armidale, NSW, in September 1994, speakers addressed issues such as
marketing, advertising, pricing, quality, computer software programs,
public liability and networking.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The needs analysis consultancy found that some operators and
organisations were concerned that there was a shortage of skills
available locally to prepare funding submissions for government training
programs and that there was a need for a clear understanding of the
eligibility requirements for each scheme. The Department of Employment,
Education and Training, including the Office of Labour Market
Adjustment, can sometimes provide funding for the preparation of such
submissions and, in other cases, local governments are able to supply
expertise.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Department of Employment, Education and Training has a number of
initiatives which rural tourism operators may find useful. Training
programs linked to employment can be particularly beneficial, providing
direct benefits for both the unemployed and the rural tourism industry.
The Jobtrain (Commonwealth Employment Service) river guide course
conducted in Tasmania in early 1994 resulted in 11 graduates securing
jobs in the adventure tourism industry. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Graduates also received AussieHost certificates which are recognised
throughout the industry as a standard of customer-service training (that
is, trained to gauge the needs, wants and expectations of customers and
to deliver). Since AussieHost's inception in July 1993, over 5000 people
have received training at some 450 workshops. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Issues</P>
<P></P>
<P>The current skills base in the rural tourism industry may not be
sufficient for rural tourism to reach its maximum potential return.
Unmet educational and training needs can restrict the ability of
individual rural tourism operators to maximise returns and contribute to
national gain.</P>
<P></P>
<P>One of the tasks of the needs analysis consultancy into rural
tourism was to investigate the applicability of the available training
programs and indicate any gaps. The consultancy found a substantial
range of basic materials, generally of high quality, for people wanting
to establish rural tourism enterprises, particularly farm-stay or bed
and breakfast establishments. However, the consultancy found a lack of
awareness among some operators, particularly newcomers, of the
availability of such training material and associated training programs,
indicating a need for reference or contact points for operators.</P>
<P></P>
<P>There is a need to communicate the availability of tailored programs
to those who can benefit from them. Many rural operators may be linked
into networks providing agricultural education (e.g. TAFE colleges)
which could be used to deliver information on tourism programs. Local
and regional bodies might also benefit from greater awareness and
understanding of the tourism industry.</P>
<P>One way to improve training provision is to have improved
communication between the training bodies and those wanting training.
TTV advises that, in Victoria, some regional areas have set up industry
advisory bodies which communicate local industry needs to the regional
TAFE college which has the capacity to work out appropriate solutions.</P>
<P></P>
<P>It is not only in areas specifically relating to the management of
the business that education is required. The needs analysis consultancy
found a lack of general knowledge about tourism industry associations
and industry structure among both operators and regional tourist
associations. The consultancy also noted a lack of awareness among
operators of the nature of other tourist attractions in their own
region.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Besides meeting the needs of operators, it may also be that the
provision of training can be used to improve the attractiveness of
membership of regional tourism associations. The needs analysis
consultancy suggests that a program be developed for providing
professional advice to operators to be delivered as a part of regular
meetings. The consultancy suggests one hour be set aside to workshop one
theme, idea or aspect of business such as `capital gains tax
implications on the sale of renovated heritage buildings' and `effective
radio interview techniques'.</P>
<P>In preparing training strategies or packages for rural tourism, it
may not be necessary to train new educators specifically for rural
tourism development. Existing trainers in other fields, such as business
advisers in rural areas, may be able to complement their repertoire of
general business knowledge with a tourism component.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The needs analysis consultancy also reported problems with the
recent growth of four-wheel-drive vehicle ownership and increasing
incidents of vandalism and irresponsible behaviour by visitors to
country areas. Travellers need to be made more aware of their broad and
specific responsibilities in using the countryside, whether it be on
publicly- or privately-owned property. There are already some codes of
conduct, such as the 4Rs in Cape York, Queensland. </P>
<P></P>
<P>STRATEGY: Ensure the educational and training needs, with regard to
tourism, of tourists, rural tourism operators, rural communities, local
government authorities, regional tourism associations, regional
development organisations and all spheres of government, are known and
are being met.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Actions</P>
<UL>
<LI>Encourage industry training for rural tourism operators (all
spheres of government, industry associations, TTA, regional tourism
associations).</LI></UL>
<P></P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC22">6.5 Marketing 
</A></H2>
<P>Marketing can be defined as `analysing consumer needs and desires
and developing and promoting products that will meet these needs at
prices mutually acceptable to both producer and consumer' (Dickman 1989,
p. 224). Traditionally, it has also included the four Ps--product,
place, price and promotion. In the tourism and hospitality industry,
people also play an important role. This is particularly relevant in the
rural tourism sector where the enjoyment of a rural holiday can be
strongly influenced by the nature of the personal contact between guests
and hosts. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Global competition for the tourism dollar is such that being able to
target a potential consumer market skilfully, develop an interesting
product that meets that market's expectations, and then promote widely
and creatively to the specific market will determine how successfully a
country's tourism industry performs against that in other countries.
This requires governments, regional associations and industry to work in
cooperation to achieve a coordinated marketing strategy.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism is an industry segment which has the capacity to add
to the variety of product and to play an integral role in making
Australia more competitive in the world tourism market.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In January 1994, the ATC launched its Partnership Australia
initiative, a national cooperative marketing venture between Federal,
State, Territory and industry tourism bodies. The Partnership Australia
initiative aims to convert consumers' desire to visit Australia into
holiday bookings by helping the industry to develop and market a greater
variety of product, improve the distribution of information and product
to the international travel industry and consumers, and broaden industry
and consumers' knowledge of Australia.</P>
<P></P>
<P>This philosophy of cooperation to achieve marketing economies of
scale is a significant ingredient in successful marketing and can be
applied equally well at the operator level as at the national
`Partnership' level. A strong cooperative marketing approach is
essential (whether it be within the context of a rural tourism body such
as AFACT or with other operators). The Blue Mountains region in New
South Wales is a good example where operators have worked closely
together in association with the local tourism authority to present a
wide combination of product and a strong national and international
image.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Cooperative or joint marketing through informal groups of operators
or through regional, State or national marketing organisations such as
the ATC or AFACT, allows marketing to be achieved in a most efficient
and profitable manner. One of the benefits to operators of belonging to
a national organisation such as AFACT is that marketing can be more
focused and sustained than if they were to act on their own.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Other benefits of cooperative marketing include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>increased cost-effectiveness where the pooling of resources can
lead to better quality and larger scale promotions and advertising and,
usually, higher returns;</LI>
<LI>a greater variety of market opportunities where more markets can be
targeted in a wider variety of locations;</LI>
<LI>better representation at industry functions and trade shows which
can provide extensive information on industry-wide trends and activities
and also serve as a good conduit through which to promote rural tourism
products;</LI>
<LI>more credibility in the eyes of wholesalers and inbound tour
operators who tend to regard a cooperative marketing entity as more
likely to provide a quality product (A significant component of the
ATC's rural tourism price/product campaign in Asia involves
familiarising agents and conducting road show programs to educate sales
counter staff on the extent and variety of Australian rural tourism
product available.);</LI>
<LI>better access to information through networking opportunities and
increased negotiating and purchasing power; and</LI>
<LI>a greater variety of product for the tourist to enjoy, which might
affect the length of time spent in an area.</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>The packaging of a combination of country accommodation and cuisine,
horse riding, shopping opportunities, country fairs, ecotourism and
heritage visits, with appropriate transport, is an example of the
diversity of rural product that might be required to attract
wholesalers, inbound tour operators and tourists themselves. Event
marketing, including conventions and incentives, is an expanding market
sector, and there are ample opportunities for spin-offs to rural
tourism. There is potential for a greater number of smaller workshops,
seminars and conventions to be held outside the capital cities, tying in
with local events such as festivals. In such cases, through thoughtful
marketing, the delegates may be enticed to visit the area before the
convention or remain in it afterwards.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism operators will benefit from the ATC's five-year theme
year program, which is promoting the rich diversity of Australia's
unique character and heritage to the international market. In 1995, the
theme is `Celebrate Australian Art and Culture' and in 1996 it will be
`Experience the Festivals of Oz'.</P>
<P></P>
<P>As well as innovative packaging, high quality, locally made
merchandise is a good marketing tool to advertise the product to others
when the visitor returns home. Rural Australia, particularly where there
are traditional forms of agriculture, life style and transport (e.g.
horse drawn vehicles, paddle steamers and so forth) has a popular image.
The plying of old trades is also a tourist draw card. Successful
merchandising, however, is dependent on operators and local communities
having the appropriate market knowledge and skills to make and sell
products representative of a particular region. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The Cobb and Co. Museum in Toowoomba, Queensland, fulfils a number
of functions including education (the teaching of old trades such as
coach building, wheelwrighting and saddle making to young people), the
preservation of coaches and equipment, and tourism. It also has a strong
merchandising aspect where the history of horse-drawn vehicles is
profitably marketed in books, postcards, posters and other items. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Individual operators have a responsibility to ensure their
advertising budgets are used to best advantage. To this end, operators
should collect data to research target markets and the most effective
advertising avenues for their particular products. Operators also need
to be aware of their position in the market to realistically target the
competition by delivering a superior product for the consumer.</P>
<P>A summary of market needs, <I>Rural Travellers to
Australia--Summary</I>, commissioned by the ATC, provides an overview of
the types of travellers to rural areas from the major international
markets targeted by the ATC. This publication is available from the ATC.<B>
</B></P>
<P><B></B></P>
<P>Issues</P>
<P></P>
<P>Rural tourism operators who rely solely on individual marketing
efforts and fail to take advantage of coordinated marketing strategies
may deprive themselves of additional custom and therefore profitability.
They may retard regional growth and even affect overseas interest in,
and bookings for, rural holidays. </P>
<P></P>
<P>While the small scale of many rural tourism operations is their
major strength in terms of the special holiday experience they can
offer, in relation to marketing it is one of their weaknesses. This can
be overcome in part by packaging rural activities and attractions at the
regional and national levels and establishing strong links with
distribution and publicity networks. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Strong links into distribution and publicity networks are necessary
to ensure that rural tourism product is easily available to all those
who wish to access it. Unless these networks are firmly in place, travel
agencies and other trade outlets are unlikely to recognise rural tourism
as a serious product worth selling. This situation may be alleviated
slightly by the increasing numbers of free and independent travellers
(FITs), both domestic and international, now emerging as major buyers of
tourism and who may generate individual demand at travel agencies.
However, difficulties may arise even in this situation as many FITs do
not use normal trade channels to obtain travel information but get it
from travel magazines and books such as the <I>Lonely Planet</I> and
<I>Let's Go</I> guides.</P>
<P></P>
<P>STRATEGY: Promote coordinated and cooperative marketing of rural
tourism opportunities.</P>
<P>Actions</P>
<UL>
<LI>Continue to support the development of a coordinated approach by
the ATC to targeting key overseas markets, extension of promotions and
trade servicing (industry associations, Federal, State and Territory
Governments).</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>The Federal Government has provided funding for the Partnership
Australia initiative in which marketing efforts are being channelled
into a unified, national approach to market Australia overseas (in
1994-95, total contributions from the Federal, State and Territory
Governments will be at least $17.6 million).</P>
<P></P>
<P>A key benefit of the initiative will be the development of a strong
consumer push beyond traditional destinations and into regional tourism
areas.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Encourage regional marketing cooperation (operators, industry
associations, regional tourist associations and development
organisations, marketing organisations, all spheres of government).
</LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>AFACT recently launched its privately-funded `Host Farm and Country
Stays' international marketing program. The program is aimed at
increasing the profile of, and visitation to, rural Australia and began
with the Travel Australia Britain Seminar (TABS) in Bangkok in September
1994. AFACT's Executive Officer attended the seminar with funding
assistance from the RTP.</P>
<P></P>
<P>AFACT has received funding under the RTP to investigate the
feasibility of developing a national information database for rural
tourism products. AFACT intends to supplement this with a reservations
capacity which will simplify procedures for making bookings, an
important aspect of successful marketing.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A rural tourism price/product campaign is currently being run by the
ATC in Asia. The campaign, which received funding of $200  000 under
the RTP in 1993-94, is designed to convert into bookings the high level
of interest already being shown in rural Australia by Asian tourists. A
rural tourism project officer position is also being funded under the
RTP ($60  000 in 1993-94 and $40  000 in 1994-95) in conjunction
with the campaign.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Under the RTP, funding of $40  000 has been provided to the Swan
Valley Tourism Council in Western Australia to enhance its regional
marketing base through the development of a tourism assets register, the
conduct of perceptual research and the establishment of a marketing
identity for the region.</P>
<P></P>
<P>This project demonstrates the importance of taking stock of tourism
attractions already available in a region, determining how these
attractions are viewed by visitors and what action can be taken to
develop and package products such that they meet the expectations of
established and emerging markets.</P>
<P>	Encourage the rural tourism industry to ascertain and focus on
target markets which are most likely to demand the product and services
it has to offer. These might include, for example, people interested in
short breaks, families, special interest groups and seminars (operators,
industry associations, marketing organisations).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Under the RTP in 1993-94, the Federal Government provided funding of
$30  000 to the ATC to undertake further analysis of the
Commission's segmentation studies to ascertain the type of international
visitors rural tourism operators should target and to assist in the
appropriate development of rural tourism products and marketing
programs.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Encourage better knowledge and usage of the distribution and
publicity networks available for providing travel agents, wholesalers,
inbound tour operators and FITs with more information on rural tourism,
particularly packages involving a combination of activities and
attractions (operators, industry associations).</LI>
<LI>Encourage the rural tourism sector's efforts to strengthen its
profile and connections with the broader tourism industry, through such
activities as industry attendance and participation in such annual
events as the ITOA symposium, TCA's Australia Tourism Conference and
National Seminar Program (the latter is run in conjunction with the
ATC), and where appropriate, the ATC's Australian Tourism Exchange and
Dreamtime trade shows and, where possible, overseas events such as TABS
and International Tourismus Borse (operators, industry associations,
marketing organisations).</LI>
<LI>Encourage regional cooperation and the marketing of a mix of
tourism enterprises in the area for the benefit of visitors and the
local tourism sector (operators, regional tourism associations and

associations, all spheres of government).</LI></UL><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC23"
>6.6 Market analysis
</A></H2>
<P>The BTR provides the basis for most tourism market analysis in
Australia through two national travel surveys, the Domestic Tourism
Monitor and the International Visitor Survey. These surveys are
complemented by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Integrated
Regional Database, a collection of data from different ABS surveys,
particularly the Survey of Tourist Accommodation. These surveys provide
data on tourism activity at the national, State/Territory and regional
levels.</P><P></P><P>In addition to these surveys, the Commonwealth's
major responsibilities for tourism research are:</P><UL>
<LI>tourist expenditure surveys;</LI>
<LI>research in support of policy formulation at the national level;</LI>
<LI>market analysis of tourism data through both the ATC and the BTR;
and</LI>
<LI>estimation of the economic significance of tourism at the national,
State and Territory levels.</LI></UL><P></P><P>The States and
Territories contribute to many of these undertakings through their
partial funding of the BTR. In addition, many of the States and
Territories collect their own data and do research to complement the
information available from the national surveys. For example, New South
Wales conducts research into rural tourism (Country Holiday, Domestic
Holiday research project) and also produces estimates of tourism
activity at the local government area level. Queensland, Tasmania and
the Northern Territory conduct their own tourism surveys to collect
regional data. South Australia has produced a range of publications
focusing on tourism in its various regions. Western Australia has in the
past conducted a detailed survey designed to produce reliable regional
data.</P><P></P><P>The problem of obtaining reliable tourism data for
the lesser visited regions from the national tourism surveys prompted
BTR to develop the methodology for a Regional Tourism Monitor. This
methodology is being adopted in 1994-95 by both Victoria and Western
Australia.</P><P></P><P>Issues<B></B></P><P><B></B></P><P>Where
rural tourism enterprises have been developed on an ad hoc basis without
reference to relevant data, research on market trends and related
strategic issues, there is a danger that the full potential of this
industry segment has not been realised.</P><P></P><P>Planning for
sustainable rural tourism should include market analysis (e.g.
visitation to regional areas including length of stay, visitor profile
data, associated spending, visitor satisfaction levels, visitor
expectations and return visits). Reliable visitation data is essential
for informed policy formulation, the planning of regional tourism
strategies and product development.</P><P></P><P>There seems to be an
expectation in many parts of the tourism industry that government should
satisfy their research needs. As TCA recognised in its Chairman's report
of 1992: `There is always a strong temptation to look to the government
to do the necessary research, but this would not give us commercial
outcomes'. Industry, as well as government, has responsibility for data
collection and analysis.</P><P></P><P>STRATEGY: Encourage the
provision of reliable regional data and research on rural tourism
supply/demand factors.</P><P></P><P>Actions<B></B></P><UL>

leadership
</A></H2>
<P>Both the McKinsey and <I>Working Nation</I> reports emphasise the
importance of committed and energetic leadership to the development of
regional Australia. Strong regional leadership which, at its best,
consists of a group of committed people drawn from all parts of the
community, can favourably influence the local business and investment
environment, generating regional growth and new jobs.</P><P></P><P>Rural
tourism fits well into this framework. While it has the potential to
contribute to the diversification of both the tourism industry and rural
areas, it can only do so if there are people in industry and the local
community willing and able to direct its growth and development.</P><P></P><P
>At present, industry-wide leadership is undertaken by such major
tourism organisations as TCA and ITOA. The issues they deal with tend to
have national implications for the tourism industry as a whole (for
example, TCA's evidence to the current parliamentary inquiry into
tourism and taxation), although as mentioned above in section 4.1, TCA
is devoting increasing attention to regional issues, for example through
the proposed development of a National Regional Tourism Strategy. More
directly involved with rural and regional tourism are the rural-oriented
tourism organisations such as AFACT; the State-based operation, Country
Victoria Tourism Council (CVTC); and the marketing body, Tasmanian
Holiday Retreats. Although the newly-formed Bed and Breakfast Council
will represent all areas of Australia, the potential involvement of bed
and breakfasts, which are estimated to number over 2  000 in rural
Australia (approximately three-quarters of all bed and breakfasts
Australia-wide), could give this organisation significant rural
presence.</P><P></P><P>Industry leadership, no matter how committed
and progressive, cannot work effectively without community support and
involvement. At the regional level, community leaders can include
representatives from local government, regional development boards,
regional tourist associations, local businesses, community groups and
the general public. Community leaders working together with a strong
shared vision of what a region can become are essential to the
successful development and management of tourism in country areas.</P><P>
</P><P>Issues</P><P></P><P>Without strong leadership and strategic
planning at the regional and national levels, rural tourism may not
develop its full potential. The industry's decentralised nature, its
preponderance of small businesses and the diversity of its product
highlight the need for a cohesive leadership structure which can
represent the interests of rural tourism operators as a distinct tourism
industry sector, both regionally and Australia-wide.</P><P></P><P>A
strong national representative body could, on behalf of its members:</P><UL>

<LI>market rural tourism products nationally and internationally;</LI>
<LI>develop and monitor accreditation as well as higher and consistent
standards, and promote the merits of such schemes;</LI>
<LI>communicate with Government and liaise with tourism and non-tourism
bodies on rural tourism issues;</LI>
<LI>act as a conduit for rural tourism information; and </LI>
<LI>investigate such matters as sponsorship, insurance, and training
and education.</LI></UL><P></P><P>Success in achieving these
objectives would determine the extent to which rural tourism operators
would be able to take advantage of combined buying power, increased
market share, and enhanced communication and networking structures.</P><P>
</P><P>To be effective, members of the tourism industry and interested
parties must know about industry organisations and their roles. AFACT is
looking at this issue on behalf of its own members. The needs analysis
consultancy found a lack of general knowledge amongst both operators and
regional tourist organisations concerning industry associations and
industry structure. (This issue is addressed at section 6.4.)</P><P></P><P>

rural tourism sector of the industry through the development of
sponsorship, partnership and membership arrangements so that AFACT

<A NAME="RTFToC25">6.8 Transport and infrastructure
</A></H2>
<P>Rural tourism products are often found in relatively remote regions
with low population density. The availability of reliable and
competitively priced transport infrastructure is therefore important to
the development of rural tourism. </P><P></P><P>A number of
submissions to <I>Tourism Discussion Paper No. 1--Rural Tourism
</I>identified transport infrastructure as a constraint to such
development. While transport issues identified in the submissions
varied, in general they related to regional issues such as the poor
state of roads (which can add to travelling time and stress the motoring
tourist), lack of reliable transfer services and strict licensing
regulations for transport providers. </P><P></P><P>In particular,
respondents identified irregular bus and train services to regional
hubs, inadequate facilities at those hubs, and inadequate signage in
many parts of rural Australia. Signage is very important for developing
touring routes and enhancing the rural product through interpretation.</P><P
>The reluctance of some tourists, particularly international visitors,
to travel on dirt roads to reach rural attractions can be exacerbated by
hire car firms either not providing cars for use on dirt roads or
charging greater accident premiums which reflects the insurers'
perception of risk. Cutting premiums for higher risk would require
cross-subsidisation by lower risk users, an action which could affect
other sectors of the tourism industry.</P><P></P><P>Although concerns
have also been expressed about train services, including the lack of
catering on particular lines and limitations of advance booking
facilities, rail travel in some areas is assisting in the development of
rural tourism. For example, Countrylink, the business unit of State Rail
which operates long distance passenger trains and an interlinking coach
service across New South Wales, is offering travel packages to
destinations right across New South Wales and interstate. These packages
provide highly competitive deals for accommodation, tours and other
interesting activities. Among the packages offered are a variety of
Central West and outback New South Wales tours including a two-day
safari covering the Western Plains Zoo and a five-day golf enthusiasts
tour of the North Coast.</P><P></P><P>Issues </P><P></P><P>There are
two key aspects of rural tourism transport infrastructure. One is the
availability and the cost of transport to rural tourism regions and the
other is the provision of transport infrastructure within these regions.</P><P
></P><P>In general, access to rural tourism regions has been enhanced
in recent years as a result of various micro-economic reforms of the
transport sector, including aviation reforms. These reforms have
resulted, in most cases, in lower fares and a wider choice of services
for visitors travelling to major regional centres. </P><P></P><P>The
reform of the domestic and international aviation sectors, in
particular, has opened up opportunities for operators to provide new
services demanded by consumers. For example, the liberalisation of the
international charter policy has resulted in some regional centres being
used for direct international flights, offering tourists convenient and
less expensive access to these regions. </P>
<P></P><P>The recently announced privatisation of FAC airports also
allows some opportunities for regions to become more involved in the
operation of airports, with potential benefits for rural tourism.</P><P></P><P
>In addition, reforms of the road and rail sectors currently under way
have the potential to increase the competitiveness of these modes of
transport with likely benefits to rural tourism. In particular, the
recent changes to road funding arrangements and the Australian Transport
Council's national review of road funding needs, due to be completed in
April 1995, have the potential to contribute to road transport
improvements to the benefit of rural tourism. </P><P></P><P>Under the
new road funding arrangements introduced in 1994, Federal Government
responsibility for the funding of roads is confined to the construction
and maintenance of the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS circles
Australia linking the mainland capitals and other major cities and
includes certain urban roads which provide links to the National
Highway. The Federal Government will provide $820 million during 1994-95
to fund the NHS program.</P><P></P><P>The responsibility for all other
roads rests with State and Territory Governments and local governments.<B>
 </B>In 1994-95,<B> </B>the Federal Government will provide $350
million and approximately $325 million, respectively, in untied grants
to State and Territory Governments and local governments as
discretionary funding to help these governments discharge their road
funding responsibilities.Councils throughout Australia currently spend
about $2.5 billion per annum on roads.</P><P></P><P>At the regional
level, public transport sometimes offers travellers limited itineraries,
irregular services and inappropriate time tabling as schedules are
arranged to suit the major users first. While this inconvenience can be
frustrating and deter potential country visitors, there is a limited
likelihood of change without a corresponding increase in demand. It will
be incumbent on operators to direct visitors to the most favourable
services.</P><P></P><P>The establishment of National Rail which is
likely to act as a catalyst for structural improvements to other rail
services, including rural services, and the development of uniform
regulations of driving hours and road worthiness for buses may also
benefit rural tourism. </P><P></P><P>In some States, tourist operators
report their businesses are being adversely affected by the requirements
of State licensing laws pertaining to the transport of passengers
(tourists) from and to airports, bus and railway stations. It is
sometimes a requirement that the transport vehicle (which for small
operators can be, in effect, the family car) be licensed in the same
manner as a coach service and the driver may be required to possess the
same standard of licence as a coach driver.</P><P></P><P>Tourism
infrastructure needs in rural areas necessarily reflect the type and
level of rural tourism. `Hard' adventure travellers may prefer to look
after themselves, but the majority of rural tourists will expect to be
provided with at least basic facilities. In rural areas with limited
exposure to tourists, requirements may include easier access and the
provision of basic facilities such as a toilet block, while in more
tourist-developed areas, parking facilities and information boards may
be expected. To encourage higher levels of visitation further facilities
may be required such as developed heritage/walking trails, signage,
parks and information services (which could be offered as an adjunct to
another business such as a grocery store or garage). In turn, regional
centres, which act as a nucleus for tourist exploration, will require
more comprehensive visitor information centres than the local areas.</P><P>
</P><P>Providing appropriate public infrastructure is important to the
growth of rural tourism. It can be either purpose-built, modified,
renovated or simply opened up according to the needs of the types of
visitors envisaged. Whether this provision occurs at a basic level or
the infrastructure itself is made into a feature of the area will depend
on the innovativeness of local people and available funding.</P><P></P><P>
The low population density of regions providing rural tourism product
can often mean local demand is inadequate to justify the provision of
regular transport services. On the other hand, it is unlikely that
demand for transport services and related infrastructure created by
travellers would in itself justify provision of these services. Tourist
facilities of this nature can only be justified if supported by demand
from all users and should only be provided with the support of the wider
community, which in most cases will carry a large part of the financial
burden. This raises the issue of the capacity of local communities to
finance public infrastructure to support tourism and the possible need
for assistance from State and Federal Governments.</P><P></P><P>On the
other hand, rural tourism generated demand for transport infrastructure
could, in some cases, enhance returns on investment in the existing
infrastructure. Some rural communities might benefit if the demand
generated by a growing tourism industry makes it less likely that
transport services to rural areas will be discontinued due to
insufficient patronage.</P><P></P><P>Meeting the cost of
infrastructure for tourism is likely to continue to be a contentious
issue. This must be addressed when communities are deciding whether, and
how, tourism is likely to be viable in their particular area. If tourism
is decided upon, then it will be necessary to convince the community
(the rate payers) of the benefits of tourism so that they are able to
see the justification for changes in local funding priorities (or rate
increases) where it is necessary to cover infrastructure costs.
Communities must also understand the pros and cons of cost-recovery
measures and how they can best be implemented.</P><P></P><P>STRATEGY:
Encourage improvements in rural transport and infrastructure.</P><P></P><P>
Actions</P><UL>
<LI>Examine the potential for increased transport demand to specific
regions in light of expanding tourism opportunities to convince local
transport operators of the commercial opportunities available to them as
a result of growth in tourism, and encourage them to take up these
opportunities by providing transport services which cater for visitors
(AFACT, other industry associations).</LI>
<LI>Liaison between State and Territory Governments and industry
concerning licensing laws pertaining to the transport of tourists

<LI>Consider local transport needs,<B> </B>including roads, in the
preparation of overall regional and local development strategies,
including those specifically for tourism (all spheres of<B> </B>government,
regional development organisations, regional tourist associations).</LI>
<LI>Ensure that the economic benefits of rural tourism gain appropriate
attention in the consideration of road and infrastructure funding needs
and planning (State and Territory Governments, local governments).</LI>
<LI>Promote the regions to charter operators with the view to
encouraging direct flights to regional areas, where appropriate, or to
encouraging linkages with key charter programs for on-carriage of
visitors to more remote areas not accessible by direct flights or which
cannot justify direct flights because of low passenger numbers (all
spheres of government, regional tourism and development associations).
</LI>
<LI>Seek greater involvement by regional interests, where appropriate,
in the management and/or ownership of regional airports with a view to
promoting the attractiveness of their regions to airlines and potential
visitors (State and Territory Governments, local governments, regional
development associations).</LI>
<LI>Raise awareness in rural communities which have significant tourism
potential of the benefits from investing in public infrastructure to
support tourism (local governments, regional tourism associations.)</LI>
<LI>Provide funding for rural tourism infrastructure development and
for demonstration projects to develop best practice models for tourism
related local infrastructure (all spheres of government).</LI></UL><P></P><P
>Grants for the provision of infrastructure may be available through the
RTDP, the NEP, the SONTS program and the FEP. These programs are
described in the
<I>Tourism Assistance Guide</I>.</P><P></P><P>The establishment of
the Regional Strategic Infrastructure Fund ($10 million in 1994-95 and
then $20 million per year to 1997-98) by the Federal Government (to be
administered by the Department of Housing and Regional Development) is
designed to further the provision of infrastructure of regional
significance.</P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC26">6.9 role of local
government
</A></H2>
<P>Local government is a significant player in influencing the
development of tourism in rural Australia. While the tasks of the ATC
and of the State and Territory tourism authorities are to attract
tourists to Australia and the States and Territories, respectively, a
significant part is played by local governments and local tourist
associations in encouraging them to stay. </P><P></P><P>In many rural
areas, local government is operating effectively, and it is the main
provider of services and infrastructure essential for tourism and
general economic development. Local government is already a major
financial contributor to tourist associations and information centres in
much of rural Australia and is also a very significant tourism operator
in its own right (through caravan parks, local museums etc.).</P><P></P><P>
Planning for tourism development takes place at all levels, with State
and Territory Governments setting the broad regulatory framework. Within
this framework, local government is responsible for implementing the
planning and development processes for the assessment and approval of
projects, and, in so doing, finetuning those processes to reflect local
conditions. A Tourism Planning and Development Project (administered by
the Office of Local Government in the Department of Housing and Regional
Development) is currently examining mechanisms which facilitate the
effective coordination, integration and delivery of tourism services at
the local level. The Office of Local Government has also begun a Local
Approvals Review Program (LARP)--Business Regulations project which will
look at reform of business regulation by State and local governments
that affects small to medium-size businesses at the local level.</P><P></P><P
>The role of local government in developing the economic strengths of a
region is complex. Although accountable to State Governments through a
range of Acts, and in some cases constrained by this legislation, local
governments may have significant autonomy in the planning and
development decisions they make and in the way, and extent to which,
they exploit opportunities for economic growth. The situation varies
considerably from State to State. Both the McKinsey and the <I>Working
Nation </I>reports emphasise the importance of regions being able to
help themselves and bear more responsibility for their own development.
Planning for tourism needs to be proactive, and local government has a
leading role in ensuring that this occurs.</P><P></P><P>As part of
local government efforts to improve the quality of management at the
local level, the Australian Local Government Association (ALGA) has
developed a guide, <I>Integrated Local Area Planning</I>, which sets
out a recommended approach to local area planning and management. Many
of the major principles underlying integrated local area planning are
applicable to rural tourism development. These include the need to take
a holistic view of local areas when developments are planned, to ensure
community involvement in planning and management processes, and to
recognise that local areas and communities differ and therefore require
distinct responses and solutions according to their circumstances.</P><P>
</P><P>Local government involvement in, and support for, tourism
development can take many forms. They include: </P><UL>
<LI>flexible regulation of development and land use zoning controls
such that tourism projects can be easily accommodated<B> </B>(subject
to the framework established by State Governments). Consideration needs
to be given to how well current planning policies and practices cater
for the needs of tourism, and the extent to which the lack of
consistency in local government regulations and charges across the
nation impedes the development of rural tourism;</LI>
<LI>identification of the tourism strengths of an area and capacity to
cater for new and emerging markets such as backpackers and special
interest groups like agricultural education tours, which have different
implications for local area planning and decision making;</LI>
<LI>extensive consultation with, and provision of advice to, the local
community, the private sector and other government bodies on how best to
plan, develop and promote tourism in a local area;</LI>
<LI>preparation of local area tourism plans and strategies which ensure
that tourism development takes place according to the `economic vision'
set down for an area, including in the context of wider regional plans
and strategies, and which seek to maximise coordination and cooperation
between private and public interests. Environmental and social issues
also must be considered;</LI>
<LI>formulation of local area policies which facilitate the
establishment of tourism businesses, tourism infrastructure and local
beautification works in the form of streetscapes, tourist circuits, shop
fronts, town entrances and effective signposting; and</LI>
<LI>promotion of tourism through support for local tourist associations
and information centres.</LI></UL><P></P><P>Issues</P><P></P><P>While
many local government authorities have successfully taken up the tourism
cause, some have yet to come to terms with tourism as a viable economic
alternative to other rural-based industries such as mining and
agriculture, and as a sector deserving active promotion. However, an
appreciation of the potential benefits of tourism, by itself, is not
sufficient: there is a need to convert this knowledge into
implementation.</P><P></P><P>As local government exercises day-to-day
management in the environment in which the tourism industry operates at
the grassroots level, it needs to appreciate tourism issues, benefits
and opportunities and be able to deal with inquiries from the private
sector about developing new, or improving existing, tourism businesses
in rural areas. A lack of understanding of tourism specific issues may
result in missed opportunities.</P><P></P><P>There is a need to
identify best practice studies for tourism development and other
initiatives which include establishing specialised education programs to
increase the tourism skills base of interested local government and
regional tourist and economic development officers.</P><P></P><P>Equally,
operators need to cooperate with local government and be aware of the
current issues with which it is dealing; the aspirations it holds for a
region; and the planning, zoning, environmental and social impact issues
that affect its decision making. </P><P></P><P>STRATEGY: Further
enhancement of local government understanding of the benefits and
requirements of tourism, and the value of integrated industry and
government planning.</P><P></P><P>Actions</P><UL>
<LI>Encourage more local councils to consider tourism as a viable
income-producing sector for local areas, and as a means by which to
raise the quality of life, and to integrate it into overall economic and
community development frameworks (all spheres of government, industry,
rural communities, regional development organisations and regional/local
tourist associations).</LI></UL><P></P><P>In 1993-94 the Federal
Government established the RTDP which is designed to assist regional
areas, through responsible planning and management practices, to develop
tourism opportunities that guarantee long-term employment and
sustainable tourism businesses.</P><P></P><P>Under the RTDP, grants
are available to local government authorities, regional tourism
associations and regional development organisations for integrated
regional tourism planning, tourism infrastructure development and
coordination of tourism information at a regional level.</P><UL>
<LI>Consult with local communities and the private sector on how and to
what extent tourism development should take place, including the
provision of timely and accurate advice to potential developers and
investors (local governments, rural communities, private sector).</LI>
<LI>Support the ALGA's Integrated Local Area Planning program, which
promotes the adoption of strategic approaches to urban planning and
service delivery by local government (all spheres of government,
industry, rural communities, regional development organisations and
regional/local tourist associations).</LI>
<LI>Increase local government awareness of Federal and State
initiatives and programs established to assist, either directly or
indirectly, the development of tourism in local areas (all spheres of
government, regional development organisations, regional/local tourist
associations).

Commonwealth Government is encouraging the development of regional
Australia to generate long-term economic and employment growth. A
significant element of its commitment to regional Australia is the RTDP
which aims to spread the economic benefits of tourism to rural and
regional Australia by providing assistance for strategic tourism
planning, infrastructure projects and tourism information coordination
within a region. This kind of regional development will improve the
capacity and ability of regional Australia to attract international and
domestic tourists.</P><P></P><P>The RTDP will provide total funding of
$23 million over the four years to 1996-97 to local government
authorities, regional development organisations and regional tourism
associations for:</P><UL>
<LI>the development of regional tourism plans;</LI>
<LI>the provision of tourism infrastructure to increase the capacity of

</B>The National Ecotourism Strategy was released in March 1994. It aims
to identify the major issues affecting the planning, development and
management of ecotourism in Australia and to develop a national
framework to guide ecotourism operators, natural resource managers,
planners, developers and all levels of government in addressing those
issues.</P><P></P><P>The Government has committed $10 million to
implement the Strategy through the NEP for projects that assist with:</P><UL
>
<LI>the development of appropriate ecotourism infrastructure;</LI>
<LI>the monitoring of tourism impacts through baseline studies to
assess and manage ecotourism impacts;</LI>
<LI>the integration of ecotourism in regional planning; and</LI>
<LI>the organisation of ecotourism conferences and workshops.</LI></UL><P>
</P><P><B>Forest Ecotourism Program (FEP). </B>The FEP aims to
encourage and facilitate ecotourism in forests throughout Australia on a
sustainable basis. It is directed towards developing opportunities for
visitors and tourism operators to understand and appreciate forest
environments while encouraging the sustainable management of natural
resources.</P><P></P><P>The program is a competitive grants program
developed under the National Forest Policy Statement. The 1992-93 budget
included $1.9 million over four years for forest ecotourism initiatives.
Fifteen projects were funded in 1992-93 and 17 in 1993-94. Individual
grants under the program are usually limited to $30  000.</P><P></P><P>
A wide range of projects will be considered for funding. These may
include minor infrastructure projects (such as tourist boardwalks,
viewing platforms and interpretative signs), education and awareness
activities, applied research, development of forest ecotourism planning
and management strategies, and tour operator training workshops and
seminars.</P><P></P><P><B>Sites of National Tourism Significance
Program (SONTS).
</B>The SONTS program was announced in the Prime Minister's Statement on
the Environment in December 1992. It aims to encourage and facilitate
the ecologically sustainable management and use of natural sites of
national tourism significance. The Government will provide $2 million
over three years from 1993-94 to fund the program.</P><P></P><P>The
program is directed at:</P><UL>
<LI>State and Territory Governments and local government authorities
that contribute to the development, management and conservation of
natural sites of national tourism significance;</LI>
<LI>natural areas of current national and/or international tourism
significance where the environmental values are under threat by
increasing levels of tourist activity;</LI>
<LI>natural areas of potential or emerging national and/or
international tourism significance where the environmental values are
likely to be under threat by increasing levels of tourist activity; and</LI>
<LI>projects that contribute to ecologically sustainable tourism
development, natural resource management, site planning, visitor and
operator education and training, and applied research.</LI></UL><P><B></B></P><P
><B>Backpacker Program. </B>Broadly, the Backpacker Program is expected
to reduce impediments to growth, expand marketing networks, improve
standards of backpacker accommodation, encourage a strategic approach to
the development of the backpacker tourism market and ensure a positive
return to the economy. </P><P></P><P>Through funding of almost $4
million over four years to 1996-97, the program aims to:</P><UL>
<LI>facilitate the development of a viable, professional and
internationally competitive backpacker industry;</LI>
<LI>facilitate wider dispersion of the employment, economic and social
benefits of tourism through the Australian community; and</LI>
<LI>provide opportunities to broaden the tourism product base and cater
for a wider cross-section of visitors.</LI></UL><P>In August 1994,
Tourism <B>New South Wales</B> released its <I>Regional Tourism
Strateg</I>y. One of the key aims of the strategy is to establish
regional tourism organisations that are able to represent the interests
of the industry and government in their area, both in marketing and
development of tourism for their region. Area-specific tourism
strategies have also been produced for the North Coast, Illawarra,
Hunter, South Coast and Murray regions.</P><P></P><P>As part of the
ongoing development of tourism there has been a greater focus on the
marketing of rural tourism through increased promotion of farm and
country experiences to both domestic and international markets. A
`Country Holidays' brochure has been released as part of the Seven
Wonders of New South Wales campaign.</P><P></P><P>Other initiatives
undertaken include increased training for rural tourism operators,
better roads and signage, ecotourism and cultural awareness programs.</P><P>

through its Strategic Business Plan identifies regional tourism
development as an important and integral part of Victoria's tourism
strategy. Ten product regions have been identified based on the State's
natural attractions. Regional tourism development and marketing plans
are progressively being prepared for each of these areas. </P><P></P><P>
Strategic planning projects are also being developed for specific
industry segments such as bed and breakfasts, farm stays, nature-based
tourism, backpackers and Koori tourism all of which have implications
for the development of rural tourism. A regional marketing program
provides funding to the State's product areas and an opportunity for
direct participation by rural tourism organisations and operators.</P><P>
</P><P>There are strong links between the Victorian Tourism Commission
and State tourism bodies, a number of which affect the development of
rural and regional tourism. These include the Country Victoria Tourism
Council, the peak organisation representing country tourism in that
State, the Victorian Tourism Operators Association, the Victorian
Accommodation Association, the Victorian Host Farms Association, the
Caravan Parks Association, and the Victorian Wineries Tourism Council
(recently established to develop and promote wineries tourism).</P><P></P><P
>To counter deficiencies in information about regional tourism in
Victoria, a regional tourism monitor has been established. It collects
detailed information about visitor characteristics and accommodation use
and quantifies the contribution tourism makes to the Victorian economy.</P><P

developing a tourism strategy to provide a basis for the sustainable
development of its tourism industry. The issues raised by the strategy
will have an impact on rural tourism.</P><P></P><P>The Queensland
Government recently created the Office of Rural Communities, which
provides policy advice for Government to generate fair access for rural
communities to social and economic opportunities. </P><P></P><P>In
addition, a number of regional tourism strategies are being undertaken
which identify tourism as a means for diversifying rural and regional
economies.</P><P></P><P>To support this focus on rural tourism,
increased marketing research is being undertaken along with greater
promotion of outback Queensland.</P><P>Contacts:</P><P><B>	</B>Tourism

is particularly active in developing and promoting rural tourism.
Tourism development strategies as well as regional marketing plans have
been prepared for a number of rural regions. A visiting journalist
program, State marketing and funding programs, and support for such
initiatives as festivals are contributing to the growth of rural
tourism. </P><P></P><P>South Australia also administers a tourism
development fund<B> </B>to assist tourism development initiatives,
including those in rural and regional areas. Development projects which
have received assistance to date include tourist information and

areas, sign posting and specific rural attractions such as the penguins
at Penneshaw on Kangaroo Island.</P><P></P><P>Contact officer:</P><P>	Mr

><B>Western Australia</B> has been active in the development of rural
tourism. A regional tourism plan is expected to be published in late
1994 and a number of publications on rural tourism have been produced,
including <I>Towards a Nature</I> <I>Based Tourism Strategy for
Western Australia</I> and a discussion paper, <I>Getting into Host
Tourism</I> and <I>Farm, Station and Country Retreats</I>. The `Value
of Tourism'<I> </I>campaign, in November 1994, was targeted at local
communities and groups as well as local government to raise awareness of
tourism's contribution to town and regional economies and employment
opportunities. The campaign addressed the prospect of generating
confidence and optimism in rural Western Australia, through tourism, and
as a result, encouraged people to recognise the industry not only as a
business opportunity, but also as a major contributor to local
economies.</P><P></P><P>The State Government also has a number of
funding programs which are specifically directed to rural and regional
tourism. For example, grants are provided to country tourism
organisations which promote <B>a</B> region's tourism products.</P><P></P><P

is currently preparing an industry development plan which will
incorporate aspects of rural and regional tourism. The plan is expected
to be available in December 1994. </P><P></P><P>Individual tourism
operations such as the historic grazing properties of Woolmers and
Brickendon at Longford have strategic management plans to assist their
development as major rural tourist attractions.</P><P></P><P>As in
South Australia, a Tourism Development Scheme provides an important
source of funding for rural tourism with farm stays, local fine foods
and wines, and industrial tourism benefiting. Special events, such as
the Targa prestige car rally and the Great Tasmanian Bike Race, are also
sponsored to encourage the spread of economic and social benefits to
rural areas and improvements in regional infrastructure.</P><P></P><P>The
Tourism Business Information Service, along with the Tasmanian Visitor
Survey, provide all operators with relevant research, information and
market analysis on the various sectors of the tourism industry. A
handbook entitled
<I>Being a Successful Tourism Operator</I> has been prepared along with

<TITLE>National Ecotourism Strategy - Foreword - Section 5.5</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BACKGROUND="/images/yellow_rock.gif"><H1><A NAME="RTFToC64">Foreword</A></H1><P>Message from the
Federal Minister for Tourism. the Honourable Michael Lee MP</P><P></P><P>
Ecotourism provides an opportunity for Australia to take advantage of
its unique natural environment by targeting the growing domestic and
international market for environmental tourism experiences.</P><P></P><P>
To realise this potential it is imperative that any economic gains from
ecotourism occur with minimal impact to natural and cultural
environments.  A number of key issues must be addressed to ensure this.</P><P
></P><P>The Federal Government believes that an overall policy
framework for the planning, development and management of ecotourism is
fundamental to optimising the benefits it offers.  The <I>National
Ecotourism Strategy </I>seeks to facilitate an integrated approach to
the development of ecotourism in Australia.  </P><P></P><P>The
Strategy has been developed through a process of wide public
consultation, including workshops in all States and Territories and a
national call for submissions.  A <I>Draft National Ecotourism Strategy
</I>was published and circulated for public comment in November 1993. 
This consultation process revealed a need for the development of
innovative approaches to tourism planning and infrastructure
development, agreed industry standards, a national system of
accreditation, and research to facilitate more informed decision-making.</P><P
></P><P>The Federal Government has committed $10 million over the next
four years for programs to help implement the <I>National Ecotourism
Strategy.  </I>The programs are designed to help spread the economic and
employment benefits of ecotourism throughout regional Australia.</P><P></P><P
>I believe the <I>National Ecotourism Strategy
</I>provides the framework required to project Australia's ecotourism
industry into a prosperous and ecologically sustainable future.  
</P> 
<H1><A NAME="RTFToC65">National Ecotourism Strategy
</A><BR>
<A NAME="RTFToC66">Vision</A></H1>
<P>Australia will have an ecologically and culturally sustainable
ecotourism industry that will be internationally competitive and
domestically viable. Ecotourism in Australia will set an international
example for environmental quality and cultural authenticity while
realising an appropriate return to the Australian community and
conservation of the resource.</P><P></P><H1><A NAME="RTFToC67">Aims</A></H1>
<P>Identify the major issues that affect--or are likely to affect--the
planning, development and management of ecotourism in Australia.</P><P></P><P
>Develop a national framework to guide ecotourism operators, natural
resource managers, planners, developers and all levels of government
towards achieving the vision.Formulate policies and programs to assist
interested parties to achieve the vision.</P><P></P><H1><A NAME="RTFToC68"
>SUMMARY</A></H1>
<P>The <I>National Ecotourism Strategy </I>examines issues associated
with ecotourism and how it can be planned, developed and managed in the
Australian context.  </P><P></P><P>Interest in ecotourism has arisen
from increasing numbers of people visiting and learning about natural
environments and the need to adopt minimal impact practices to maintain
the quality of the environments visited.</P><P></P><P>There are
numerous definitions of ecotourism, from which common elements can be
extracted and combined to distinguish ecotourism from related
operations. These elements are, broadly, a focus on the natural
environment, ecological and cultural sustainability, education and
interpretation, and local and regional benefits.  Based on these
elements, the following definition has been adopted:</P><P><B></B></P><P>
<B>Ecotourism is nature-based tourism that involves education and
interpretation of the natural environment and is managed to be
ecologically sustainable.  </B></P><P><B></B></P><P>This definition
recognises that `natural environment' includes cultural components and
that `ecologically sustainable' involves an appropriate return to the
local community and long-term conservation of the resource.</P><P></P><P>
The major issues affecting the planning, development and management of
ecotourism in Australia have been identified through an extensive
consultation process and are detailed in chapter 5.  They are:</P><P></P><UL
>
<LI>minimal impact and <B>ecologically sustainable </B>approaches to
tourism planning, development and management;</LI>
<LI>the need to simplify the processes used in the <B>planning </B>and
<B>regulation </B>of ecotourism, increase their effectiveness and
integrate approaches across government boundaries and between agency
jurisdictions;</LI>
<LI>factors affecting the <B>management of natural resources </B>to
meet the challenges of growth in ecotourism, including the resource
constraints that could be imposed by additional use;</LI>

<A NAME="RTFToC69">1.INTRODUCTION</A></H1> 
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC70">1.1 Why have a national ecotourism strategy?
</A></H2> Ecotourism is widely considered, both in Australia and
overseas, as an area of the tourism industry with significant growth
potential.  It is seen both as an important niche market, with a
particular range of experiences sought by particular visitors, and as a
catalyst for encouraging the tourism industry to be ecologically
sustainable.<P></P><P>For Australia, ecotourism offers the potential
to generate foreign exchange earnings, employment, and other economic
and social benefits, particularly in regional areas.  It presents
Australia with the opportunity to make the most of its international
competitive advantage, with its spectacular and diverse natural
features, unique flora and fauna and diverse cultural heritage.
Ecotourism can also provide resources for environmental conservation and
management and an incentive for the conservation and sustainable use of
both public and private land.  Unless properly managed, nature-based
tourism can result in damage to, or even loss of, the resources on which
it depends.</P><P></P><P>The <I>National Ecotourism Strategy </I>fits
within the framework of the National Tourism Strategy released by the
Federal Government in June 1992.  The National Tourism Strategy
recognised four strategic goals, including an environmental goal:  to
provide for sustainable tourism development by encouraging responsible
planning and management practices consistent with the conservation of
our natural and cultural heritage. </P><P></P><P>The Federal
Government believes that the formulation of an overall policy framework
for the planning, development and management of ecotourism, for both our
inbound and domestic markets, will contribute to the achievement of
sustainable tourism in natural areas.  Accordingly, the Government has
committed $10 million over the next four years for the development and
implementation of a national ecotourism strategy.</P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC71"
>1.2 The strategy development process
</A></H2>
<P>This Strategy was developed as a result of public consultation and
comment on the <I>Draft National Ecotourism Strategy</I>, which was
released in November 1993, and further consultation with Commonwealth
and State and Territory agencies.  </P><P></P><P>Input to the Draft
Strategy was sought from a broad range of individuals and organisations,
including government, in particular local government, natural resource
managers, tour operators, tourism marketers, planners, conservation and
community groups, developers, and Aboriginals and Torres Strait
Islanders.</P><P></P><P>Public consultation prior to the launch of the
Draft Strategy included workshops in all States and Territories and
discussions with government agencies (at all levels), industry and
conservation bodies, and community groups.  This was complemented by a
national call for written submissions from individuals and organisations
interested in ecotourism.  The submissions and workshops are listed in
appendixes A and B respectively.</P><P></P><P>Considerable work on the
development of ecotourism has already been done, or is currently being
undertaken, by State and Territory Governments, local governments,
industry, and conservation and community groups.  Such initiatives have
formed, and will continue to form, an important part of the <I>National
Ecotourism Strategy.</I></P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC72">1.3
Approach
</A></H2>
<P>The purpose of the <I>National Ecotourism Strategy </I>is to
provide broad direction for the future of ecotourism by identifying
priority issues for its sustainable development and recommending
approaches for addressing these issues.</P><P></P><P>The integrated
approach to the planning, development and management of ecotourism
presented in this Strategy hinges on a relatively broad definition of
ecotourism (chapter 3), although the definition has been more carefully
specified as a result of comment on the Draft Strategy.  </P><P></P><P>There
is a degree of overlap between the various issues covered in this
document, which is a reflection of their linkages and interrelationships
and the complementary nature of the actions that address them.</P><P>This
Strategy has been developed on the basis of consultation and, therefore,
emphasises the practical experience of the people involved in the
industry and of the communities affected by ecotourism.  While it
occasionally refers to ecotourism destinations and products, these are
purely illustrative and many other examples of equal merit exist.</P><P></P><P
>The implementation programs identified in this Strategy have been
developed from the premise that the principles of ecotourism can be
applied to all nature-based tourism and to many aspects of the industry,
although funding priorities will focus on projects that incorporate all
the elements of ecotourism (these are identified in chapter 3).  </P><P></P><P
>Calls for individuals and agencies interested in participating in the
implementation of this Strategy will appear in the national press.</P><P>

</P><H1><A NAME="RTFToC73">2. BACKGROUND
</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC74">2.1 Interested parties
</A></H2>
<P>A number of interested parties are taking a role in the planning,
development and management of ecotourism in Australia.</P><P></P><P><B>
All levels of government </B>have become interested in the benefits that
ecotourism potentially offers host communities while conserving the
natural environment and some have integrated ecotourism into strategic
planning. Government involvement also includes the marketing of
ecotourism through State and Territory tourism commissions and the
Australian Tourist Commission (ATC). Federal, State and Territory and
local governments are responsible for policies, programs and regulatory
activities affecting ecotourism.</P><P></P><P><B>Tourism industry
associations </B>such as the Australian Tourism Industry Association and
the Pacific Asia Travel Association represent the interests of tourism,
including ecotourism operators, retailers and wholesalers.  They are a
central source of information, networking, and marketing, educational
and business advice for their members.  They also promote the
development and implementation of environmental policies and codes of
practice in tourism.</P><P></P><P><B>Non-profit associations </B>represent
the views of ecotourism operators, retailers and wholesalers, natural
resource managers and others interested in ecotourism.  They aim to
promote understanding, appreciation and conservation of the natural and
cultural environment, develop ethics and standards for ecotourism, and
facilitate interaction between tourists, host communities, the tourism
industry, government and conservation groups.  Non-profit associations
include the Ecotourism Association of Australia, and other associations,
such as the Australian Association for Environmental Education and
national parks associations, have complementary agendas.</P><P></P><P><B>
Professional societies </B>such as the Environment Institute of
Australia, the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales, the
Geological Society of Australia, the Australian and New Zealand
Scientific Exploration Society, the Institute of Foresters of Australia
and the Australian Association of Veterinary Conservation Biologists
have members with expertise that can be applied to ecotourism. 
Professional societies also represent the interests of designers,
including architects, industrial designers and town planners with
responsibility for the design and construction of ecotourism facilities.</P><P
></P><P><B>State-based conservation councils and conservation groups
</B>such as the World Wide Fund for Nature Australia and the Australian
Conservation Foundation have developed policies on ecotourism as a means
of promoting the ecologically sustainable, commercial use of natural
resources.  These groups provide an opportunity for members to be
involved in ecotourism, and influence its development.  </P><P></P><P><B>
Unions </B>are also developing an interest in ecotourism.  The
Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Conservation
Foundation are currently undertaking a joint project to foster `green
jobs' in a number of industries throughout Australia, including tourism.
 </P><P></P><P><B>Community groups </B>and organisations such as
Greening Australia, Community Aid Abroad and the Australian Trust for
Conservation Volunteers are an integral part of the successful delivery
of ecotourism in Australia.  </P><P></P><P><B>Recreational groups
</B>such as four-wheel drive associations, horse riders, bushwalkers,
canoeists and others who participate in outdoor recreation activities
have a strong interest in conservation and environmental quality.</P><P></P><P
><B>Natural resource planners and managers </B>balance the conservation
of natural resources with the demands and opportunities of nature-based
tourism, and the associated resource allocation and equity issues.</P><P>
</P><P><B>Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders </B>are involved as
resource managers, site and intellectual property custodians,
landholders and operators.</P><P></P><P><B>Educational institutions</B>,
including universities and colleges of technical and further education,
make an important contribution to the planning, development and
management of ecotourism through their courses and research.  In some
cases these institutions operate educational travel enterprises.  </P><P>
</P><P><B>Financial institutions </B>and other business development
and training agencies are important to the establishment and viability
of ecotourism enterprises.</P><P></P><P><B>The media </B>can
encourage the sustainable development of tourism through the use of
appropriate images and the promotion of environmental codes of practice
and minimal impact activities for tourists and operators.</P><P></P><P><B>
International organisations </B>such as the American Ecotourism Society,
the Adventure Travel Society, the Audubon Society, World Wide Fund for
Nature International, Tourism Concern and the North American Network for
Ethical Tourism provide an international context for work undertaken in
Australia and further the debate about ecotourism and sustainable
tourism.  </P><P></P><P><B>Tourists </B>are taking an increasing
interest in the long-term sustainability of the environments they visit.</P><P
></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC75">2.2 Changing community values
</A></H2>
<P>The era since the end of Second World War has been described as an
`age of mass tourism' (Holloway 1989) because of the worldwide expansion
of tourist activity.  Advances in communications technology, transport
infrastructure and tourist facilities have led to an increase in the
number of people travelling and also to changes in the way people
travel.  An estimated 3 million international tourists visited Australia
in 1993, and the number is expected to reach 4.8-6.8 million by the year
2000.</P><P></P><P>Large markets lend themselves to segmentation,
creating opportunities for service providers to cater for those seeking
ecotourism or other nature-based tourism experiences.  This group
includes a segment whose choice is influenced by the extent to which
products and services are environmentally responsible.</P><P></P><P>These
trends have been documented in recent years.  Ranney (1991) argues that
the environment is now the primary social concern of the international
community and that travellers are seeking experiences that are
environmentally responsible, primarily within a natural setting.  In a
study of young Australian travellers by Huie (1990), 30 per cent
indicated that they avoid commercial ventures.  Huie described this type
of traveller as an `anti-tourist' or `committed conservationist, pioneer
and adventurer, well-educated and a free spender'.  </P><P></P><P>Coates
(1991) and Kusler (1992) argue that various trends are shaping the
relationship between tourism and the natural environment, including:</P><UL>

<LI>growth in awareness of environmental issues in both developed and
developing nations; </LI>
<LI>growth in the proportion of relatively well-educated people with
significant disposable income and propensity to travel; </LI>
<LI>new demographic groups such as two-income households and `baby
boomers' reaching the peak of their earning capacities; </LI>
<LI>increased exposure to new and remote places through the media;</LI>
<LI>increased attention to indigenous cultures and cultural tourism;
</LI>
<LI>major political and other events that influence tourists to seek
out safe destinations; </LI>
<LI>improved scientific knowledge associated with ecological interest
and combined with a belief that many natural environments are being
permanently altered or destroyed;</LI>
<LI>increased desire for experiences that are authentic and incorporate
learning, rather than contrived entertainment; and</LI>
<LI>increased concern about crowding at existing destinations.</LI></UL><P>
</P><P>These trends indicate that community values are changing in such
a way as to increase the demand for ecotourism experiences and the
desire for a sustainable approach to tourism development.</P><P></P><P>Increased
availability and wider promotion of ecotourism opportunities have
increased community interest in ecotourism.</P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC76"
>2.3 Policies and programs
</A></H2> 
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC77">2.3.1 Commonwealth Government
</A></H3> The increasing interest in ecotourism in Australia and
overseas is reflected in national and international policy development.<P>
</P><P>The impacts of tourism are recognised in various Government
policy documents, including the National Tourism Strategy (June 1992)
and the <I>National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development
</I>(December 1992).  These documents recognise the need to provide for
an ecologically sustainable tourism industry consistent with our natural
and cultural heritage.</P><P></P><P>National Tourism Strategy</P><P></P><P
>One objective of the National Tourism Strategy is `to promote the
development of "eco-  tourism" that enhances visitor exposure to and
awareness of the ecology of our unique natural attractions'.  While this
objective is endorsed in the <I>National Ecotourism Strategy</I>, the
definition of ecotourism has been revised.  </P><P></P><P>The National
Tourism Strategy also recommends that the industry, conservation groups
and government liaise through the Intergovernmental Agreement on the
Environment to seek a cooperative approach to the management of
environmental issues in tourism contexts.  The agreement, announced by
the Prime Minister in the <I>One Nation </I>statement in February 1992,
aims to better define the environmental roles of respective governments,
reduce intergovernmental environmental disputes and provide for better
environment protection and more certain government and business
decision-making.</P><P><I></I></P><P><I>National Strategy for
Ecologically Sustainable Development</I></P><P><I></I></P><P>The <I>National
Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development </I>states that the
tourism industry can be developed and managed in a way that conserves
its natural resources and built heritage base and minimises negative
environmental, social and cultural impacts.  The strategy identifies a
number of actions that are important for the development of ecotourism:</P><UL
>
<LI>encouraging strategic planning at the regional and local level;</LI>
<LI>developing and adopting industry codes of environmental practice
and impact minimisation programs;</LI>
<LI>examining regulatory mechanisms for the tourism industry;</LI>
<LI>improving public information and education materials on
environmental impacts associated with tourist activity; and </LI>
<LI>encouraging further research into the economic and environmental
impacts of tourism.</LI></UL><P></P><P>The strategy also states that
resource allocation decisions should focus on Aboriginals' and Torres
Strait Islanders' land, heritage, economic and cultural development and
employment concerns, and that indigenous Australians' involvement in
decision-making processes and relevant consultative arrangements should
be strengthened.  </P><P></P><P>Environmental obligations</P><P></P><P>
In addition to the National Tourism Strategy and the <I>National
Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development</I>, the Commonwealth
Government has environmental obligations under other policies formulated
with the State and Territory Governments.  These include the <I>National
Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity</I>,
the <I>National Forest Policy Statement</I>, and the National Strategy
for Rangeland Management (in preparation).</P><P></P><P>Tourism is a
principle focus of the Resource Assessment Commission's <I>Coastal Zone
Inquiry:  Final Report </I>(1993).  Of particular relevance is the
proposed adoption of a National Coastal Action Program--to be
oversighted by a National Coastal Management Agency--which may have
significant implications for the future planning, development and
management of ecotourism.  This report is presently being considered by
Government ministers.</P><P></P><P>The Commonwealth Government also
works with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) and cooperates with the World Tourism Organisation, as well as
fulfilling Australia's international obligations under the Convention on
Biological Diversity and the Convention on Climate Change. The
Convention on Biological Diversity (ratified by Australia on 18 June
1993) came into force on 29 December 1993; the Convention on Climate
Change (ratified by Australia on 30 December 1992) will come into force
on 21 March 1994.  </P><P></P><P>International obligations also affect
tourism in Antarctic territories .  There is presently a small amount of
such tourism, although there is potential for growth.  The management of
ecotourism in the Australian Antarctic Territory is consistent with
international obligations deriving from the Antarctic Treaty and will be
subject to the conservation strategy currently being developed for the
Australian Antarctic Territory.  Ecotourism in the Australian Territory
of Heard Island and McDonald Islands will be subject to the provisions
of the management plan currently being developed for this territory
(Antarctic Division--Department of the Environment, Sport and
Territories, submission 536).</P><P></P><P>Legislation</P><P></P><P>Commonwealth

Statement </I>(released in December 1992), funding of $1.9 million over
four years was provided to encourage ecologically sustainable tourism
activities in forest areas through the provision of infrastructure,
education, training and research.</LI>
<LI>Sites of National Tourism Significance Program:  As part of the
Prime Minister's <I>Statement on the Environment </I>(announced in
December 1992), a total of $3.9 million over four years was provided to
encourage and facilitate the ecologically sustainable management and use
of natural sites of national tourism significance.  A total of $1.9
million was provided to the Australian Nature Conservation Agency for
management and conservation projects at Uluru and $2 million to the
Department of Tourism for a grants program to fund site hardening
projects, educational programs and interpretive displays, public
facilities and research projects in sensitive areas.</LI>
<LI>Regional Tourism Development Program:  As part of the 1993-94
Budget, the Government provided $23 million over four years to develop
tourism in regional and rural Australia.  The program aims to improve
the capability of regions to attract international and domestic tourists
by providing grants for development of integrated regional tourism
plans, diversification of the product base of regions, provision of
tourism infrastructure and coordination of tourism information at a
regional level.</LI></UL><P></P><P>A number of Commonwealth
environment programs are also relevant to ecotourism, including:  </P><P>
</P><UL>
<LI>the National Estate Grants Program (administered by the Australian
Heritage Commission);</LI>
<LI>the Endangered Species Program (administered by the Australian
Nature Conservation Agency); and</LI>
<LI>the Ocean Rescue 2000 initiative (administered by the Australian
Nature Conservation Agency, the Department of the Environment, Sport and

></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC78">2.3.2 State and Territory Governments
</A></H2>
<P>All State and Territory Governments have an interest in ecotourism
either directly, in the particular context of nature-based tourism, or
through broader planning frameworks.  Most of these strategies and plans
are being prepared through a consultative process that includes tourism
and natural resource management agencies working in conjunction with
other government, industry and conservation groups. </P><P><B>New
South Wales </B>has addressed ecotourism and ecological sustainability
within the NSW Tourism Development Strategy and is about to begin work
on a tourism master plan.  The plan is due for release in April or May
of 1994.</P><P></P><P>At the end of 1992 the <B>Victorian </B>Government
produced a policy document,
<I>Ecotourism: A Natural Strength for Victoria-Australia</I>,
identifying a 13-  point plan to stimulate ecotourism in the State.  The
plan proposed actions for implementation. </P><P></P><P><B>Queensland
</B>is preparing an ecotourism strategy; the release date is yet to be
announced.</P><P></P><P>The <B>South Australian </B>Government
initiated a major study in March 1993 to clarify market directions for
the State's fledgling ecotourism industry as the basis for the
development of an ecotourism strategy.  Work done to date has included a
review of existing South Australian ecotourism product, market research
(initially focused on the United States) and testing of sample
itineraries in the marketplace.  Developmental work on the strategy has
now commenced.  The issues to be dealt with will include product
development, infrastructure requirements, industry standards,
accreditation and training, the development of a South Australian
ecotourism brand, and a marketing and communication strategy.</P><P></P><P>
<B>Western Australia </B>has developed environmental guidelines for
tourism development and a product guide for nature-based tourism.  The
Government, through the Western Australian Tourism Commission, has
formed a Nature Based Tourism Advisory Committee to develop a strategy
for nature-based tourism in the State.</P><P></P><P><B>Tasmania </B>is
in the process of developing an ecotourism strategy that will involve
all resource management agencies and the industry.  The strategy is

Territory </B>is incorporating the principles of ecologically
sustainable development into its `master plan', which will set
guidelines for development over the next five years.  The plan endorses
the conservation of the natural environment as essential to the Northern
Territory experience and is scheduled for release in March 1994.</P><P></P><P
>The <B>Australian Capital Territory </B>Government allocated resources
in its 1993-94 Budget for the development of a marketing strategy for

economic considerations and will provide clear guidelines for ecotourism
in the Australian Capital Territory.</P><P></P><P>These initiatives
are a fundamental component of the overall policy framework for the
development of ecotourism in Australia and will complement the
<I>National Ecotourism Strategy</I>.
</P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC79">2.3.3 Local governments
</A></H2>
<P>Local governments are actively involved in the planning, development
and management of ecotourism through the marketing of their regions'
natural attractions, the development of approaches to visitor management
and the approval and provision of facilities and services.  Ecotourism
is already a major economic activity in many local government areas,
while others are looking to sustainably develop their potential in
ecotourism in order to accrue local benefits.  </P><P></P><P>The
implementation of regulations associated with ecotourism development is
primarily carried out by local governments through authority delegated
under State Acts.  Local government regulations and planning instruments
include planning schemes, by-laws, codes and regulations, developed
within State Government parameters.  Local governments are, therefore,
fundamental to the integrated regional planning process. </P><P></P><P>Local
governments also have a major role in promoting the design and
development of environmentally sensitive and energy efficient facilities
through their local planning and building approval processes.  The
potential for local governments to include `low-impact' parameters in
these processes can apply to all tourism developments.
</P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC80">2.3.4 Non-government organisations
</A></H2>
<P>The challenges of effectively managing the impact of tourism around
the world have led to the formation of international organisations that
work to raise awareness of tourism's social, cultural and environmental
impacts and seek to address these impacts constructively.  The emergence
and growth of such organisations has been marked since the early 1980s. 
They include Tourism Concern in the United Kingdom, the Third World
Tourism European Network (which has members in Germany, Switzerland,
France, Austria and the Netherlands), the Ecumenical Coalition on Third
World Tourism (which is administered from Thailand) and the North
American Network for Ethical Tourism (which runs a Centre for
Responsible Tourism).  Other examples include the National Audubon
Society, the Sierra Club and Not for Profit Travel, which operate in
North America.</P><P></P><P>Many non-government organisations are
actively promoting ecotourism through the development of their own
programs and products.  Australian examples include the World Wide Fund
for Nature Travel Club and universities that promote ecotourism through
study tours--such as Travelearn, based at the University of Queensland,
and the Centre for Continuing Education at the University of Western
Australia, which runs `Landscope' expeditions in conjunction with the
Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management.  Some
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups, including the Wallace Rock
Hole Community in Alice Springs, have also established ecotourism
enterprises.</P><P></P><P>Non-government environmental organisations
such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, the World Wide Fund for
Nature Australia and the Australian National Parks Association either
have, or are developing, policies on tourism, as are various
professional and industry associations such as the Australian Horse
Alliance and the Australian Ski Federation. </P><P></P><P>Tourism
industry associations have also been active.  The Pacific Asia Travel
Association has produced a paper, <I>Endemic Tourism </I>(1992), and
published a <I>Code for Environmentally Responsible Tourism</I>.  The
Australian Tourism Industry Association has also produced an
environmental code of practice and is investigating the potential of
applying the World Travel and Tourism Council's `Green Globe' standards
to Australia.  Adherence to a code of practice is a prerequisite for
membership of the Ecotourism Association of Australia, whose members
include conservation groups, natural resource managers, academics and
people from different sectors of the tourism industry.</P><P></P><H1><A NAME="RTFToC81"
>3. DEFINING ECOTOURISM
</A></H1> 
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC82">3.1 Background
</A></H2>
<P>Interest in ecotourism has arisen from a combination of increasing
demand for authentic tourist experiences and increasing interest in
environmental conservation. </P><P></P><P>It appears that the term
`ecotourism' was coined by Hector Ceballos-Lascurain in 1983; however,
ecotourism experiences have been offered as educational, outdoor or
adventure travel experiences for many years.  Ceballos-Lascurain's
definition of ecotourism incorporated two elements--tourism to
undisturbed areas and an emphasis on education:</P><P></P><P>Tourism
that involves travelling to relatively undisturbed natural areas with
the objective of admiring, studying, and enjoying the scenery and its
wild plants and animals, as well as any cultural features found there.
(Ceballos-Lascurain 1991.)</P><P></P><P>Subsequent definitions have
built on these principles and emphasised the importance of environmental
conservation and cultural sustainability with the condition that
economic activity generated by ecotourism should directly benefit the
local or host community and environment.  This is reflected in
Australian definitions of ecotourism:</P><P></P><P>Travel to remote or
natural areas which aims to enhance understanding and appreciation of
the natural environment and cultural heritage while avoiding damage or
deterioration of the experience for others.  (Figgis 1992.)</P><P></P><P>
Tourism to natural areas that fosters environmental understanding,
appreciation and conservation and sustains the culture and well-being of
local communities. (Young 1992a.)</P><P></P><P>Ecologically
sustainable tourism that fosters environmental and cultural
understanding, appreciation and conservation.  (Ecotourism Association
of Australia 1992.)</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism is nature based tourism
that is ecologically sustainable and is based on relatively undisturbed
natural areas; is non-damaging and non-degrading; provides a direct
contribution to the continued protection and management of protected
areas used; and is subject to an adequate and appropriate management
regime.  (Valentine 1991.)</P><P></P><P>The term `ecotourism' has been
open to misinterpretation by planners, operators, managers, marketers
and the media (Wight 1993), with the result that it has been used to
describe a range of products that do not fall within any of the
definitions cited in this Strategy.  This broad use has led to debate
throughout the industry and the community and has led to the creation of
other terms, including `sustainable', `minimal impact' and `responsible'
tourism, and also to related but wider approaches, such as `endemic'
tourism. </P><P></P><P>None of these definitions or alternative terms
provide a discrete test that will precisely distinguish ecotourism from
other forms of tourism. </P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC83">3.2 The
elements
</A></H2>
<P>The definitions quoted in section 3.1 suggest that ecotourism is
comprised of:</P><UL>
<LI>the natural environment;</LI>
<LI>ecological and cultural sustainability;</LI>
<LI>education and interpretation; and</LI>
<LI>provision of local and regional benefits.</LI></UL><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC84"
>3.2.1 Natural environment
</A></H2>
<P>Ecotourism relies on use of the natural environment and includes a
focus on biological and physical features.  The conservation of natural
areas and natural resource management are therefore essential to the
planning, development and management of ecotourism.</P><P></P><P>Many
natural areas have significant Aboriginal, European, Asian or other
cultural values.  Although the focus of ecotourism is on the natural
values of an area, it is impractical to separate the natural and
cultural components of ecotourism (Australian Heritage Commission,
submission 113).  Cultural tourism that is an authentic part of the
natural area visited can be an ecotourism opportunity (Charters,
submission 545).  Therefore, for the purposes of this Strategy, the term
`ecotourism' can embrace the sustainable use of cultural as well as
natural assets, even if cultural assets are not explicitly referred to
throughout the document. </P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC85">3.2.2
Ecological and cultural sustainability
</A></H2>
<P>Tourism activity that degrades the environment, adversely affects
the local community or fails to return worthwhile economic benefits is
not sustainable in the long term.  Ecotourism is managed to avoid or
minimise negative impacts and to confer benefits on host communities and
environments, for present and future generations.  </P><P></P><P>Ecotourism
involves active participation by tourists and tour operators in the
conservation of an area.  For example, tourists may participate in
scientific monitoring or rehabilitation projects, or may contribute
financially to the management of an area.</P><P></P><P>Planning for
ecotourism is based on resource constraints.  Ecotourism opportunities
will be lost if the resilience of an area and the ability of its
community to absorb impact are exceeded, or if its biodiversity and
physical appearance are altered significantly.</P><P></P><P>The
impacts of ecotourism can be managed through the recognition and
application of sustainable practices.  For example, environmental
impacts can be managed using facility design, equipment and waste
management practices, that minimise impact, both at the site of the
activity and in terms of broader resource use.  </P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC86"
>3.2.3 Education and interpretation
</A></H2>
<P>Ecotourism attracts people who wish to interact with the environment
and, in varying degrees, develop their knowledge, awareness and
appreciation of it. Ecotourism operators provide an appropriate level of
environmental and cultural interpretation, usually through the
employment of appropriately qualified guides and the provision of
information both prior to and during the trip. </P><P></P><P>The level
and type of education will depend on the interests and expectations of
the tourist and will include a broad range of educational opportunities
through interpretation, interactive approaches and the use of various
media. This educational or interpretive component may acknowledge the
natural and cultural values of a destination and could also address
issues such as resource management and the role and attitude of the host
community.</P><P></P><H3><A NAME="RTFToC87">3.2.4 Local and regional
benefits
</A></H3>
<P>The benefits of ecotourism should be equitably distributed with
significant benefits accruing to the local community, even though
ecotourism businesses may be based in other communities or involve
national or multinational ownership.</P><P></P><P>Local benefits may
accrue from the use of locally based operators, the employment of local
guides and use of specialised local knowledge, the purchase of
provisions and services and the use of local facilities.  These benefits
should outweigh the cost of ecotourism to the host community and
environment, although the benefits and costs are difficult to measure.</P><P
></P><P>Ecotourism generally returns revenue, or other benefits, for
resource conservation and management, as well as bringing social and
cultural benefits. It therefore offers a positive approach to tourism
development in some areas.</P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC88">3.3
National Ecotourism Strategy definition of ecotourism
</A></H2>
<P>The purpose of the <I>National Ecotourism Strategy </I>is to
provide broad direction for ecotourism, by identifying priority issues
for its ecologically sustainable development and recommending approaches
for addressing these issues.  Accordingly, in the context of the
elements identified earlier, the following definition has been adopted:</P><P
><B></B></P><P><B>Ecotourism is nature-based tourism that involves
education and interpretation of the natural environment and is managed
to be ecologically sustainable.  </B></P><P><B></B></P><P>This
definition recognises that `natural environment' includes cultural
components and that `ecologically sustainable' involves an appropriate
return to the local community and long-term conservation of the
resource.</P><P></P><P>The achievement of broad agreement on a
definition would assist in the planning, development and management of
Australia as an ecotourism destination, define the product for the
industry and the market, and establish a framework of ecological
sustainability that could be adopted by other sectors of the tourism
industry.
</P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC89">3.4 Applying the definition
</A></H2>
<P>The definition of ecotourism given in section 3.3 can refer to a
range of activities.  For example, ecotourism opportunities and
activities may be:</P><UL>
<LI><B>highly specialised or catering to a general level of
educational interest:  </B>ecotourism involves a broad approach to
education and interpretation.  Some opportunities will require
considerable background knowledge from the participant and resemble
study tours, others will be targeted to a more general audience;</LI>
<LI><B>small or large in scale of operation:  </B>for example, many
operators who run tours to the Great Barrier Reef accommodate several
hundred people on large vessels.  Naturalists are employed to interpret
the marine environment, videos and other educational material are
provided and steps are taken to ensure that impacts are kept to a
minimum.  The visitor experience can be described as ecotourism even
though it is different from the more common situation of tourists
travelling in small groups.  However, the focus of ecotourism is
expected to remain on small rather than large scale activities;</LI>
<LI><B>remote or accessible:  </B>ecotourism experiences may involve
being totally immersed in a natural environment and at some distance
from established facilities, or visiting an environment that is more
easily accessible, perhaps from a base facility;</LI>
<LI><B>based on cultural as well as natural values:  </B>such
activities may require consultation and negotiation with local
communities (particularly indigenous communities) and organisations
responsible for the management of cultural heritage values;</LI>
<LI><B>a market segment <I>and </I>a philosophy for planning,
development and management:  </B>the elements of ecotourism are usually
applied to describe a niche market but the planning principles that
underlie ecotourism, especially conservation, should be applied to all
tourism activity.</LI></UL><P></P><P>Ecotourism is not the antithesis
of high-volume tourism but an integral and complementary part of the
tourism industry.  Ecotourism activities can serve to improve the
viability of the regional industry as a whole and act as a model for the
ecologically sustainable development of all forms of tourism.</P><P></P><P>
The term `ecotourism' cannot be patented and does not have a legally
enforceable meaning.  Given the legal implications of misleading
advertising, however, the term should always be used judiciously and
operators need to be mindful of what they can realistically deliver.</P><P>

</P><H1><A NAME="RTFToC90">4. IMPACTS AND CHARACTERISTICS
</A></H1>
<P>This chapter presents an overview of the types of impact that may be
associated with ecotourism rather than other forms of tourism.  The
impacts of tourism and ecotourism have been reviewed by a number of
authors, including Mathieson and Wall (1982) and Boo (1990). </P><P></P><P>
Impacts are usually assessed according to the sphere of activity
affected--environmental, economic, social or cultural.  The categories
are not exclusive and achieving benefits in one area may involve costs
in another.  The success of ecotourism planning, development and
management will be determined by the degree to which benefits outweigh
costs. </P><P></P><P>A study of the impacts and long-term consequences
of various types of tourism development can assist management in
developing strategies to maximise the net benefits of ecotourism.  </P><P>
</P><P>Since the impacts of tourism are often cumulative, the impacts
of ecotourism could be compounded by the entry of new
operators--potentially resulting in crowding, additional impacts on
natural resources or displacement whereby operators respond by visiting
alternative sites (Valentine, submission 524).</P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC91"
>4.1 Environmental
</A></H2>
<P>Effective environmental planning and management ensures that
ecotourism and the environment can successfully coexist.  The
environment can also gain benefits in that ecotourism can: </P><UL>
<LI>be an incentive for conserving natural areas;</LI>
<LI>provide resources (both financial and physical) for environmental
conservation and management, and incentives to `repair' degraded
ecosystems or `improve' biological diversity through, for example,
client participation in captive breeding programs or volunteer holiday
programs; and </LI>
<LI>engender an environmental ethic that goes beyond the ecotourism
context.</LI></UL><P></P><P>These benefits are often difficult to
quantify and, in the absence of work to clarify the effects, tend to be
dismissed.</P><P></P><P>The establishment of industry codes of
practice and environmental guidelines demonstrate the tourism industry's
increased emphasis on the value of conservation.  Adherence to these
codes is not monitored at this stage.  An education program for
operators may assist in implementing codes of practice.
</P><P></P><P>Mathieson and Wall (1982), Boo (1990) and Buckley (1991)
have noted the negative environmental impacts that could, without
management, result from nature-based tourism:</P><UL>
<LI>physical impacts, including clearance and damage to vegetation,
soil compaction and erosion, marine impacts (such as anchor damage,
trampling on coral, over-fishing and souveniring) and hydrological
changes to rivers, estuaries and groundwater;</LI>
<LI>pollution associated with generation of waste, which may affect
water, air and fauna; and</LI>
<LI>other, related impacts, including the introduction of exotic
species and increased fire frequency.</LI></UL><P></P><P>These primary
changes are associated with travel, accommodation and recreational
activities in natural areas (Buckley 1991).  They affect the balances
and relationships within habitats and ecosystems and therefore could
contribute to habitat modification or loss, and in some cases to the
loss of a species or a reduction in its genetic diversity.  As well as
the significant environmental changes associated with large-scale
activity, small, incremental changes can also have a major impact on the
environment.  These incremental changes may only be evident over a long
period of time and require careful monitoring.</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism
destinations vary in their characteristics, values and capacity to
accommodate tourism.  Detailed ecological information is needed for each
site to determine the number of visitors that can participate in
activities in these areas with minimal impact.  This involves baseline
studies to assess the effects of ecotourism on new and existing
destinations. </P><P></P><P>Concepts such as the recreation
opportunity spectrum, carrying capacity and the limits of acceptable
change have been identified as useful tools for management planning and
decision-making, although these frameworks do not provide managers with
absolute tools for decision support.  The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
Authority has questioned the establishment of carrying capacity for
particular sites on the basis that the process is difficult and can be
controversial (submission 538).  This has led researchers and natural
resource managers to look for new ways to address this issue (Lipscombe
1993).  </P><P></P><P>The impacts of ecotourism can be reduced,
avoided or compensated for through effective and adaptive planning and
management, although in many cases, in order to respond to immediate
management needs, ecotourism will need to be managed with an incomplete
understanding of ecological and social impacts until adequate research
is conducted (Wet Tropics Management Authority, submission 550).  In
some areas conservation requirements may preclude certain levels and
types of use (Harper, submission 569; Commonwealth Environment
Portfolio, submission 141).</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism is part of a
sophisticated tourism industry that is influenced by activities
occurring both in and beyond the boundaries of natural areas.
Consequently, environmental responsibility for ecotourism rests with
ecotourists, the tourism industry and those responsible for conservation
and environment management.</P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC92">4.2
Economic
</A></H2>
<P>Ecotourism potentially offers national, regional and local economic
benefits similar to those of other types of tourism activity, although
this potential is yet to be substantiated by specific studies.  It is
claimed (Ziffer 1989; Boo 1990; Lindberg 1991) that the direct economic
benefits of ecotourism can include:</P><UL>
<LI>additional foreign exchange earnings;</LI>
<LI>economic development, diversification and long-term stability,
particularly in regional areas;</LI>
<LI>the distribution of income directly into regional and local
economies through demand for local goods and services (this income may
then be re-spent within the community, providing indirect benefits);</LI>
<LI>the tendency for greater expenditure and length of stay by
ecotourists (compared to tourists generally);</LI>
<LI>the generation of income for the conservation and management of
national parks and other public land; </LI>
<LI>additional skilled employment opportunities, utilising local
knowledge and facilities; and</LI>
<LI>local infrastructure development.</LI></UL><P></P><P>As well as
these direct benefits, there are a number of economic benefits
associated with the conservation of an area that are compatible with its
use for ecotourism.  These have been identified by Sherman and Dixon
(1991) and include protection of watershed values, control of erosion,
and protection of biodiversity and evolutionary processes.  Conservation
can also ensure the availability of an area for education and research
as well as maintaining an option to develop the area for ecotourism in
the future. </P><P></P><P>There are a number of difficulties and
ambiguities associated with evaluating the economic impacts of
ecotourism.  For example, the decision to use natural areas for
tourism--as opposed to pure conservation, or other industries such as
agriculture, mining, logging or fishing--often involves opportunity
costs for these other uses.</P><P></P><P>In some cases the total
revenue generated from ecotourism operations may not be sufficient to
effectively meet the cost of managing ecotourism impacts, which may
place an additional burden on natural resource managers.  Where
possible, however, ecotourism operators should be encouraged to make
voluntary contributions to the conservation and management of natural
resources to sustain the environment on which their enterprises depend.
 </P><P></P><P>An important element of ecotourism is that benefits
accrue to the local community.  These benefits may be difficult to
quantify and some movement of funds away from an area or community is
inevitable.  Ensuring that the benefits of ecotourism accrue to the
local community may involve the employment of local guides, the purchase
of provisions and services locally and the use of local facilities.</P><P>

</P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC93">4.3 Social and cultural
</A></H2>
<P>While the focus of ecotourism activity is on natural areas,
adjoining communities are necessarily involved and affected.  These
communities may provide tourist services, such as accommodation and
tourist information, and are often bases for ecotourists undertaking day
excursions.  The nature and intensity of interaction between the
tourists and local communities means that ecotourism can impact on the
character of local communities.</P><P></P><P>The social and cultural
impacts of tourism, including ecotourism, are demonstrated by changes in
individual behaviour, value systems, community lifestyles and
relationships, both of tourists themselves and the communities they
visit (Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Groups 1991).  The
elements of ecotourism (as defined in this Strategy) recognise that it
is possible to identify and apply management approaches that reduce the
stresses on communities and maximise the benefits of tourism activity. 
</P><P></P><P>Involvement in ecotourism can result in significant
benefits for local communities adjoining ecotourism destinations.   If
such communities actively desire this involvement and plan for it,
ecotourism can:</P><UL>
<LI>create a variety of employment opportunities that draw on the
expertise of local people;</LI>
<LI>contribute to diversifying the economic base of regional economies,
and of the tourism industry generally, and bring a greater diversity of
facilities and services;</LI>
<LI>assist in the long-term conservation of natural areas that have
cultural value; </LI>
<LI>offer an effective means of revitalising local arts and traditions,
or lead to the conservation of traditional cultural activities in a
protected natural environment; and</LI>
<LI>encourage local communities to value, and benefit from, natural and
cultural assets.</LI></UL><P></P><P>Communities associated with
popular ecotourism destinations can also experience significant
pressures from increased activity in their region, including:</P><UL>
<LI>overcrowding, particularly at peak periods, at sites valued by both
the host community and the tourist, which may lead to resentment among
the host community;</LI>
<LI>diversion of resources in the short term away from other community
priorities in order to provide for ecotourism (this can be alleviated by
the adoption of integrated regional planning frameworks);</LI>
<LI>conflict over access to natural areas and impact on places of
cultural value; and</LI>
<LI>the commodification of local cultures.</LI></UL><P></P><P>These
pressures are often associated with a lack of planning and a lack of
broad-based community consultation, or situations where development was
based solely on commercial considerations, with little attention given
to the social and cultural impacts on host communities.  </P><P></P><P>In
the case of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, impacts
being encountered in areas of significance include unauthorised access,
unauthorised use of stories, improper behaviour and environmental
degradation (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tourism Resource
Steering Committee, submission 585).</P><P></P><P>Planning for
ecotourism should take into account expressed community preferences. 
The involvement of local communities is an integral part of the
successful planning, development and management of ecotourism. 
Community consultation should be an active process if community support
and involvement is to be maintained and ecotourism growth problems
alleviated.  </P><P></P><H1><A NAME="RTFToC94">5. ISSUES, OBJECTIVES
AND ACTIONS
</A></H1>
<P>The issues raised in this chapter have been identified and developed
through consultation with industry operators and organisations,
conservation groups, government agencies and other interested parties. 
Although each issue is presented and discussed separately, there is
considerable overlap (for example, the involvement of indigenous
Australians is critical to many aspects of the development of
ecotourism).  Opinion varies on the relative importance of these issues
and the best method of addressing them.  </P><P></P><P>The discussion
of each issue is followed by suggested strategic objectives and actions,
along with indicative responsibilities.</P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC95">
5.1 Ecological sustainability
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>The need for ecologically sustainable tourism
has attracted increasing global attention in recent years, with
recognition of the need to protect ecological systems as the basis for
our economic and social wellbeing.  The tourism sector of Australia's
economy has major impacts on the environment.  In 1990, a tourism
working group into ecologically sustainable development was established
to recommend strategies for the application of ecologically sustainable
development principles to tourism planning, development and management. 
The working group produced a report in November 1991 and many of its
recommendations were incorporated in the <I>National Strategy for
Ecologically Sustainable Development</I>.</P><P></P><P>Underlying the
application of the principles of ecological sustainability to tourism is
the philosophy that the environment must be conserved if the tourism
industry is to be viable in the long term.  The principles of
ecologically sustainable development, as applied to tourism, are
summarised as follows:</P><UL>
<LI><B>Improvement in both the material and non-material wellbeing of
Australians:  </B>This principle identifies the need to maintain the
quality of the environment--and thus the tourist experience--and achieve
good results in those areas of the industry that can be measured
numerically.  </LI>
<LI><B>Intergenerational and intragenerational equity:  </B>The values
of the natural and cultural resources that are the basis of tourism
experiences cannot be replaced if they are lost.  Tourism development
must be managed to conserve experiences for present and future visitors.
 Social equity and community participation in the decision-making
process are an integral part of this principle.</LI>
<LI><B>The protection of biological diversity and the maintenance of
ecological processes and systems:  </B>Tourism activity and development
should be planned to maintain and support these systems.</LI>
<LI><B>The global dimension:  </B>Tourism in Australia should not
contribute to unsustainable activities in other countries.</LI></UL><P></P><P
>These principles may be applied to the entire tourism industry, not
just ecotourism.   However, they are particularly applicable to
ecotourism because of its reliance on natural and cultural resources. 
Indeed, ecotourism may have greater resource implications for the
maintenance of biodiversity and the integrity of cultural resources than
many other forms of tourism activity.  The achievement of a high-quality
visitor experience and the maintenance of a resource over generations
are goals against which the success of ecotourism planning, development
and management could be evaluated.</P><P></P><P>Ecological
sustainability involves the way in which environmental and human
resources are used.  This includes the equitable distribution of
benefits such as education and training opportunities, the fulfilment of
social expectations and the participation of indigenous communities. 
</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism presents some challenges for management in
encouraging the use of Australia's natural resources while also
conserving them for the long term:</P><UL>
<LI>The outcomes of ecologically sustainable practice cannot be
adequately measured in financial or other numerical terms.  (In
contrast, success in tourism is frequently measured in terms of visitor
numbers, length of stay and revenue.)  Hence there is no commonly
accepted measure against which to evaluate the comparative benefits of
development and sustainability.</LI>
<LI>If minimal impact practices are not adopted the environment may be
adversely affected.  The environment is usually a public resource and
the cost of maintaining its integrity could, therefore, be borne by
taxpayers.</LI>
<LI>Approaches that may be taken to keep visitor impacts to a
sustainable level include restriction of access, use of permits or entry
systems, or the introduction of pricing mechanisms.  Such approaches
could be seen to have an elitist dimension or to raise concerns about
equity.  </LI>
<LI>Social and environmental carrying capacities require careful
monitoring if the resource and the experience are to be maintained. 
Such monitoring is currently made more difficult by the lack of existing
baseline studies.</LI></UL><P></P><P>Ecotourism, as defined in this
Strategy, is compatible with the application of ecological
sustainability principles; however, complexities arise in translating
these principles into practice.  Environmental conditions vary with
location and time of year, and economic, social and environmental
objectives are not always compatible.  Additional ecologically
sustainable practices could be identified and applied.  The development
of ecotourism therefore involves a move towards optimum practices
through careful management.  </P><P></P><P>The `growth-peak-decline'
cycle</P><P></P><P>The `growth-peak-decline' model was first proposed
by Butler (1980), who identified that, as destinations or attractions
become popular, they proceed through a cycle of growth, peak and
decline.  This process describes a `cycle of evolution', with tourist
areas passing through six distinct stages.  Each stage of the cycle is
characterised by different environmental perceptions and uses.</P><P></P><P
>By providing the impetus for small-scale development in areas valued
for their environmental or cultural attributes, ecotourism may be
followed by additional development to accommodate increasing visitor
numbers.  The long-term outcome of this process could be a fundamental
change in the quality of the visitor experience, including the
destruction of the values that initially attracted the visitors.</P><P></P><P
>Planning for sustainable tourism requires long-term approaches aimed at
establishing the location and scale of appropriate infrastructure and
mechanisms for its careful management.  Ecologically sustainable
management practices will mitigate the cyclical growth-peak-decline
process.</P><P></P><P>Models of sustainability</P><P></P><P>One
approach to the management of ecotourism is the development of `models
of sustainability', that is, practical examples that can be developed in
one location and then transferred to other locations or enterprises as
appropriate. These models attempt to demonstrate how ecotourism, and
consequently all tourism, can be made more ecologically sustainable.  In
so doing, they provide an opportunity to apply innovative technology and
improve management techniques.</P><P></P><P>Actions</P><UL>
<LI>Promote the elements of ecotourism (as identified in section 3.2)
as a basis for the planning, development and management of ecologically
sustainable tourism more generally (all levels of government).</LI>
<LI>Develop models of ecologically sustainable tourism through a
multidisciplinary approach incorporating technological developments and
management practices.  These models could relate to such things as waste
management, product purchase, indoor air quality, air emissions, energy
conservation, the use of non-toxic pesticides and herbicides, and water
quality maintenance, and be sympathetic to the conservation of
biological diversity (all levels of government, industry, conservation
groups).</LI>
<LI>Provide leadership in the promotion of models of ecologically
sustainable tourism and produce and distribute practical information to
target groups, including tourists, operators, planners, marketers and
others (all levels of government, industry).</LI>
<LI>Examine the development of qualitative indicators--for example,
indicators of the quality of tourist experiences and the value of
natural and cultural resources--that can be used to evaluate
ecologically sustainable practices (all levels of government, industry,
educational and research institutions).</LI>
<LI>Investigate the development and design of particular environmental
technologies for tourism (all levels of government, industry).</LI>
<LI>Involve marketing agencies and the media in promoting minimal
impact practices by tourists and providing positive examples for tour
operators (all levels of government, tourism marketing agencies,
environmental education bodies, the media).</LI>

Integrated regional planning
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>As is the case in other areas of tourism and
other business activity, ecotourism operators and developers are
required to meet established standards and regulations.  This may
involve a number of government agencies at all levels and affect the
design and development of facilities, as well as field-based tours.  The
current planning process can be cumbersome and may be costly for small
operators.  In addition, licensing and zoning anomalies between regions
can be confusing as ecotourism operations often cross park, local
government and State boundaries, and may be subject to additional
regulation (M.  Yeung, submission 104).  In particular, the process is
frequently not transparent to those becoming involved in the business of
ecotourism.</P><P></P><P>Regional planning and development strategies
could assist communities to make informed decisions about tourism
opportunities and help overcome the regulatory differences across
boundaries.  This may involve community education for participation in
the planning process (Foster, submission 583).  Strategies could also
address the need for an integrated approach to tourism development and
management by government agencies at all levels.  </P><P></P><P>Integrated
regional planning and development strategies can improve the capacity of
regions to attract foreign and domestic tourists to natural areas, help
to distribute the economic benefits of ecotourism widely and help to
reduce environmental pressures on peak demand areas.  For example,
management plans for national parks take into account the needs of
competing interests and try to reconcile the requirements of tourism
with the conservation objectives of the management agency.  </P><P></P><P>
The development of the <I>National Ecotourism Strategy </I>is intended
to address the issues common to ecotourism operators around Australia
but not to homogenise products.  </P><P></P><P>Approaches to
integrated regional planning relevant to ecotourism include:</P><UL>
<LI>recognition of the long-term social, cultural and environmental
implications of planning decisions; </LI>
<LI>local participation in the planning and decision-making process,
particularly before decisions are taken;</LI>
<LI>use of local themes to deliver a product that is authentic, unique
and sustainable; and </LI>
<LI>recognition of ecosystems (interacting and interdependent
biological and environmental systems) as the basis for ecotourism
planning, since these extend beyond shire and local boundaries and
require integrated catchment and biozone management (for example,
Queensland's Great Sandy Region Management Plan, and cooperative
management of the Australian Alps national parks).</LI></UL><P></P><P>Other
important planning considerations are biological and physical elements
(for example, soil type, rainfall and topography), national estate
values, access for operators, the ongoing viability of proposals and the
expectations of visitors.  A strategic direction will help to guide
proposals through the planning approval process and an improved
knowledge of the environmental parameters and sensitivities of a site or
landscape will help to determine appropriate codes of conduct.  The
process for assessing change should be dynamic to take account of new
information, knowledge and developments as they occur.</P><P></P><P>Integrated
regional planning, such as that undertaken for the Murray-Darling Basin
and Cape York Peninsula, could provide useful models for ecotourism
planning as they look beyond the biological factors and consider social
impacts.  They also have a strong element of community participation to
provide a framework for land use policy development and decision-making.
 </P><P></P><P>Another example of an integrated regional planning
approach is provided by the Gulf Savannah region, where several
adjoining shire councils along the Gulf of Carpentaria have cooperated
to integrate their planning processes, with particular emphasis on
promoting experiential tourism based on the unique outback environments
of the region (Australian Nature Conservation Agency, submission 146). 
Planning for ecotourism in Australia's outback should be compatible with
the National Strategy for Rangeland Management, which is in preparation
(Environment Strategies Directorate--Department of the Environment,
Sport and Territories, submission 539).</P><P></P><P>The planning
process should take into account the social and cultural priorities of
host communities to shape tourism into a form appropriate for each
locality (Craik 1991).  </P><P></P><P>Actions</P><UL>

planning strategies that provide a framework for ecotourism planning

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC97">5.3 Natural resource management
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>Management</P><P></P><P>Tourism in natural
areas has a range of impacts, some less beneficial than others.  (These
are discussed in chapter 4.)  Natural resource management is an ongoing
and complex activity; many biological processes are interdependent and
decisions affecting one process or species may impact on others.  The
natural resource management task is becoming increasingly complex as
visitation to natural areas grows, and adaptive management techniques
may be necessary to respond to changes in the natural environment and
its systems.</P><P></P><P>Ecologically sustainable tourism must be
seen as a long-term activity and ecotourism activities in protected
areas should take place within the constraints created by the need to
maintain natural and cultural values.  Plans of management can play an
important role in guiding natural resource managers and ecotourism
operators, and can be developed in conjunction with local communities
(including indigenous communities), neighbouring landowners and other
interested parties.  The role of plans of management is particularly
important where tourism use is, or is likely to be, significant.  </P><P>
</P><P>Plans of management can be used to identify critical zones that
are not always accessible or appropriate for tourism use because of
their fragility, and to provide a framework for the management of such
zones.  For example, any access limitation that may arise from
management concerns about the sensitivity of an area can be developed in
conjunction with a management plan, and the conservation basis for such
a decision can be made clear to visitors.  </P><P></P><P>Increasingly,
integrated and regional planning approaches (such as the cooperative
management of the Australian Alps national parks and the
<I>National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological
Diversity</I>) are being developed to more effectively balance natural
resource management and tourism across government boundaries and between
agency jurisdictions, and to encourage the adoption of ecologically
sustainable management practices for tourism and recreation.</P><P></P><P>
Parks are increasingly managed not only for resource protection but also
for people (Kusler 1992).  Management strategies must reflect some
understanding of the basic needs of the ecotourist and the ecotourism
business while maintaining the environment.  Park interpretation
programs conducted by interpretive and ranger staff are also important
ecotourism activities.  </P><P></P><P>Many tourists want to
participate in constructive projects as part of their holiday
experience.  Involvement of ecotourists in land reclamation and
revegetation works, following the Earthwatch and Australian Trust for
Conservation Volunteers models, could increase environmental awareness
and contribute to the work of land management and research agencies.</P><P>
</P><P>Ecotourism can provide financial and physical assistance to park
managers for impact management, maintenance and restoration works. 
Additionally, contribution to long-term goals such as monitoring, data
collection, maintenance of biological diversity and provision of visitor
education programs can be achieved through ecotourism.  </P><P></P><P>The
goals of natural resource management may be achieved to some extent
through the use of permits and licences for operators.  Goudberg
(submission 508) argues that permits that are limited in availability
and tradeable could encourage industry to care for the resource and
raise revenue for natural resource management agencies.  It is
unrealistic, however, to depend on the revenue generated from ecotourism
to fully fund management of the resource.</P><P></P><P>Land tenure</P><P>
</P><P>Ecotourism activity is not confined to protected areas but
occurs in terrestrial and marine environments under private ownership
(for example, pastoral leases and native title areas) and in other
multiple-use areas, such as State forests.  </P><P></P><P>The type and
intensity of ecotourism activity should be managed within the
constraints created by the need to maintain the natural and cultural
values of an area, irrespective of tenure.  The <I>National Strategy
for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity </I>recognises
the need to establish and manage a system of protected areas that
represent Australia's biological diversity adequately and
comprehensively.  Such a system could assist in the development of a
range of ecotourism opportunities and in recognising the need to
encourage the adoption of sustainable management practices outside
protected areas.</P><P></P><P>Multiple resource use was recognised in
the Prime Minister's <I>One Nation
</I>statement in relation to the establishment of national and marine
parks. The Prime Minister said that a prior assessment of the full range
of potential alternative uses of the area in question, and the economic
opportunities (including tourism) associated with conservation uses of
the area, would be routinely carried out when considering the
establishment of such parks. Government ministers are considering
proposals on how best to implement this commitment.</P><P></P><P>Actions</P><UL
>
<LI>Encourage the development of ecotourism management strategies
within the framework of natural area plans of management and regional
plans (all levels of government, natural resource managers, relevant
indigenous groups, operators, developers and planners).</LI>
<LI>Encourage consideration of appropriate methods of access to
ecotourism opportunities through specified modes of transport, points of
entry, licensing and permits (natural resource managers, relevant

<LI>Where appropriate, integrate natural resource management and
visitor experiences through education and interpretation programs and
materials to enhance environmental awareness (natural resource managers,
conservation organisations, relevant indigenous groups, industry).</LI>
<LI>Where appropriate, encourage partnerships between natural resource

which would work to match user needs and expectations with environmental
and social impact management (government, natural resource managers,
industry, relevant indigenous groups).</LI>

<LI>Encourage the implementation and evaluation of codes of practice

</LI></UL><H2><A NAME="RTFToC98">5.4 Regulation
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>There are arguments for industry
self-regulation of ecotourism; however, the statutory responsibilities
of natural resource managers in areas such as safety and conservation
should also be recognised.  The Government's overall objective is to
minimise regulations impeding industry growth to create a framework for
the development of a productive and efficient industry while still
protecting the public interest.</P><P></P><P>For ecotourism,
environmental conservation continues to be a major focus of both
government and industry.  Effective conservation will sometimes require
greater acceptance than currently exists of the need to establish
physical limits on tour sizes, infrastructure and visitor opportunities
in fragile environments.  (Wescott, submission 109, cites the example of
Point Nepean National Park, Victoria, where vehicle access is prohibited
and numbers are carefully restricted.) Alternatively, it could require
increased investment in visitor management to minimise the impacts from
an expanded level of visitation.  </P><P></P><P>Environmental impact
assessment</P><P></P><P>Environmental impact assessment of tourism
developments is well established, though Buckley (1991) points to
several limitations of this process in the tourism context.  In
particular, environmental impact assessment operates at the scale of the
individual project--it ignores cumulative and interactive effects and is
often treated as a one-off planning hurdle, and its operational feedback
mechanisms are generally weak.  These limitations can be reduced by
using environmental impact assessment in conjunction with other planning
tools, including regional environmental planning and environmental
audit.</P><P></P><P>The environmental impact assessment process does
not cover tours or existing operations.  The criteria applied in the
regulation of tour operators (through licensing, permits and fees in
protected areas) vary considerably between regions.  While tour
operators see this as a major impediment and have called for greater
consistency, Figgis (submission 559) has noted that any attempt to
simplify the regulatory processes should be aimed at assisting operators
and not at creating a mechanism to fast-track development.</P><P></P><P>
Codes of practice</P><P></P><P>The industry's increased emphasis on
the value of conservation is evidenced by the establishment of industry
codes of practice and environmental guidelines aimed at maintaining the
resource base on which the industry depends.  The codes themselves can
take many forms, include social and cultural as well as environmental
dimensions, and target different groups (tourists, operators and
developers).  Commercial operators are not the sole users of protected
areas and all users, including independent travellers (whose activities
have cumulative effects on the environment) should be encouraged to
adopt environmental codes of practice.  </P><P></P><P>Codes of
practice provide a stimulus for influencing behaviour although they do
not provide sanctions for noncompliance.  While some sectors of the
industry are calling for formal measures that will effectively manage
and control environmental impacts, the establishment of industry
standards and a viable, internationally recognised accreditation system
would assist in improving practices (see section 5.8, `Industry
standards and accreditation').</P><P></P><P>It may, however, be
necessary to supplement codes of practice with sanctions or incentives
depending on the circumstances.  </P><P></P><P>It is clear that, as
the tourism industry and environmental sensitivity continue to grow, the
industry will become increasingly accountable for its performance
(Plimmer 1992).  There is an opportunity to encourage innovation,
excellence and creativity through voluntary practices rather than
regulation.
</P><P></P><P>Actions</P><UL>

Territory licensing and zoning regulations where these anomalies
adversely affect tour operators (all levels of government, natural

Infrastructure
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>Infrastructure for ecotourism is often
developed in protected areas and usually involves a `scaled-down' or
minimal approach to physical development and change, although minimal
impact approaches can also be applied to large developments.  </P><P></P><P
>Infrastructure such as boardwalks and viewing platforms can be used by
resource managers to provide for visitor access to ecotourism
destinations, while at the same time assisting the management of
environmental impacts and the physical protection of natural resources. 
Many protected areas and private holdings contain infrastructure (not
necessarily tourism related) that could be utilised or improved for
ecotourism.  This has already been achieved in some areas by the
transformation of fire trails into interpretive walks.</P><P></P><P>Infrastructure
can be developed to:</P><UL>
<LI>increase the capability of sites to withstand the environmental
impacts of tourism by `confining' tourists to site-hardened areas
through the provision of carefully sited and constructed boardwalks and
walking trails;</LI>
<LI>increase the social carrying capacity of a site, for example by
directing the flow of people near a popular destination to minimise the
perception of crowding;</LI>
<LI>offer an educational component, through visitor centres and
interpretive signs, to enhance visitor appreciation of environmental
values and increase their understanding of the impacts of their
activities on the natural environment;</LI>
<LI>provide accommodation and other facilities.  Buildings can be
designed to meet visitor expectations of ecotourism and to reinforce and
enhance the ecotourist's enjoyment and understanding of the setting, and
so can do much to set the stage for conservation (Anderson 1993, pp.
116-17); and</LI>
<LI>minimise impacts by utilising environmentally friendly energy and
waste management technologies.  </LI></UL><P></P><P>Lack of funds for
the construction and maintenance of infrastructure has meant that
protected areas are frequently unable to cope with intense tourist
visitation, particularly at peak periods.  Also, the most sought-after
locations are often the most environmentally sensitive, further
complicating management.</P><P>Infrastructure may not always be
perceived as appropriate for the ecotourism experience.  For example,
for visitors seeking a `true' wilderness experience, permanent
installations can be viewed as intrusive and potentially in conflict
with the objectives of ecotourism.  This view is often expressed of
accommodation within national parks.</P><P></P><P>The tourism report
of the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Groups (1991, p. 19)
noted that `the provision of even basic services for tourists can
generate a momentum to upgrade those services particularly if the
experiences offered by the national park or nature reserve are highly
valued by the general community'.  This pressure is particularly evident
in many World Heritage areas where there are increased calls to open up
new areas that may be environmentally or culturally sensitive.</P><P></P><P
>In recent years, the need to cater for, and manage, increasing tourist
use of protected areas in times of real reductions in resourcing has led
park agencies to seek alternative sources of revenue.  Along with the
introduction of park user fees in some areas has come increasing
consideration of the possibility of using the private sector to provide
investment in park facilities and services.
</P><P></P><P>The development of infrastructure will affect the
quality of the tourist experience and has limited application in the
management of some types of ecotourism activity.  This application will
vary according to the management plans for ecotourism destinations, the
development parameters these plans establish and the potential to use or
develop infrastructure outside protected areas.  The latter point, in
particular, needs increased consideration.</P><P></P><P>Actions</P><UL>

</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>The planning, development and management of
any type of sustainable activity is dependent on the availability and
application of high-quality information. Ecotourism has developed with
relatively little data and knowledge on which to base effective
decisions.  This issue is of particular importance for the management of
visitor impacts and has been highlighted throughout the process of
developing this Strategy--in academic literature, workshops and public
submissions.  </P><P></P><P>Effective decision-making would be aided
by improved data and knowledge relating to the immediate and cumulative
impacts of tourism, and ecotourism, on the natural and cultural
environments.  Systems for monitoring impacts must be clearly understood
by all affected parties and not remain the sole domain of the scientific
community (Queensland Department of Tourism, Sport and Racing,
submission 562).  It is essential that research findings are widely
disseminated so that others may learn from them and put them into
practice.</P><P></P><P>Impacts of ecotourism</P><P></P><P>Biological
and physical impacts</P><P></P><P>Natural resource management requires
a sound scientific knowledge base for land capability assessment and for
the prevention, containment and monitoring of visitor impacts.  The
application of modern scientific techniques, such as geographic
information systems, predictive computer modelling and monitoring, can
assist in determining:</P><UL>
<LI>sustainable levels of usage in different environments; </LI>
<LI>which activities relate to which environmental impacts; and</LI>
<LI>how to avoid or control degradation.</LI></UL><P></P><P>A number
of important initiatives are currently under way.  The CSIRO Division of
Wildlife and Ecology has developed methodologies capable of monitoring
and predicting the outcomes of various management regimes in different
environments, and various State resource management agencies are also
conducting valuable research programs.  The Environment Strategies
Directorate of the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, Sport and
Territories is developing a set of environmental indicators, embracing
tourism's impact on natural resources, through its development of a
National State of the Environment Reporting System.  Internationally,
the World Tourism Organisation is developing a set of internationally
acceptable environmental indicators to strengthen planners' and
managers' understanding of the principal factors influencing the tourism
industry's long-term sustainability and prosperity (Hawkes and Williams
1993).</P><P></P><P>In the workshops and submissions that contributed
to the development of this Strategy, the general consensus was that the
scientific work on the impacts of tourism is insufficient and
under-resourced.  For example, the Australian Science and Technology
Council (submission 118) stated that the further development of
ecotourism in tropical Australia will require continued support for
baseline studies on the effects of tourism on environmental and cultural
features.</P><P></P><P>While there is a need for greater study and
documentation of impacts, a more sophisticated, integrated and
complementary approach to research and the dissemination of results is
required to formulate long-term sustainable management strategies. 
There is a role for government in advancing this objective.</P><P></P><P>
Economic and social impacts</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism cannot be measured
solely in economic terms.  Social and environmental factors are
interdependent with, and equally important to, economic development.  A
sustainable approach to ecotourism can only be achieved if attention is
also given to the social context within which tourism development
occurs.  There is a need to consider the broader effects of ecotourism
on local communities and the heritage values of an area (Hall,
submission 119).  In addition, the gathering and use of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander cultural information must recognise intellectual
property rights and requires appropriate authorisation (ATSIC
Queensland, submission 546).</P><P></P><P>Chapter 4 highlights the
current lack of information on the economic, social and cultural
benefits and costs of ecotourism.  These have yet to be adequately
distinguished from the benefits and costs of tourism generally.  Further
study is required to assess the level of development and tourist
interaction that communities can sustain and the economic significance
of ecotourism at the national, regional and local levels.  </P><P></P><P>

>5.7 Marketing
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>Australia is yet to realise its full potential
as an ecotourism destination. Australia's international tourism
marketing often features the natural environment, with an emphasis on
areas such as the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu and Uluru.  In addition, a
full range of natural and cultural experiences are available.</P><P></P><P>
Concern has arisen over the misuse of the term `ecotourism', since
expectations about what constitutes an ecotour vary, both in Australia
and overseas.   This presents a problem of definition for ecotourism
operators and planners and an ethical problem for marketers.  If
operators claim credentials in ecotourism, their practices must measure
up as sustainable and their products as authentic in this very
discerning market; for many tourists, the term creates an expectation of
certain standards of environmental quality and awareness. (There are now
legal implications in the European market if the product does not meet
advertised claims.)  Related to this is the issue of whether the
activities or destinations presented in promotional materials can be
sustainably delivered.  </P><P></P><P>Accurate marketing would lessen
the degree to which controls need to be placed on operators and their
clients.  Visitor management strategies, such as access management and
signs, need to be in place to cater for the increased tourist numbers
that could result from a successful marketing campaign.  Ideally,
therefore, marketing strategies should be based on plans of management
and developed after those plans are in place.</P><P></P><P>There are
numerous problems--for example, variations in quality and availability--
associated with marketing a sector that consists of many small operators
with a diverse range of products and a lack of uniformity or agreed
standards for the ecotourism product.  These problems can be reduced
through the cooperation of industry associations, government marketing
authorities and researchers.  </P><P></P><P>Ecotourism relies on the
development of quality, authentic products and the effective marketing
and delivery of these products to potential travellers.  As ecotourism
is a new area of activity, little specific marketing data is available. 
This lack of data is therefore a significant impediment to maximising
ecotourism growth.  The type of data required includes information
relating to:</P><UL>
<LI>the travel motivations of ecotourists--the distinction between
those for whom ecotourism experiences are the primary motivator for
travel and those for whom it is a secondary component of any travel
(ATC, submission 590);</LI>
<LI>the purchasing patterns of ecotourists (Tasmanian Department of
Tourism, Sport and Recreation, submission 561);</LI>
<LI>what ecotourists are looking for--desired experiences (ATC,
submission 590); and</LI>
<LI>perceptions of Australia as an ecotourism destination versus other
potential and competitor ecotourism destinations (ATC, submission 590;
Mielewski, submission 601).</LI></UL><P></P><P>The ATC has
commissioned a re-analysis of its segmentation studies, which were
conducted in all major markets in 1991 and 1992.  The re-analysis will
attempt to derive more information about the travel motivations and
desired experiences of potential travellers to Australia, and the ATC
has been asked to consider ecotourists specifically.  The ATC considers
that, while the re-analysis will provide some further information on the
topic, more work needs to be undertaken.</P><P></P><P>Characteristics
of the market</P><P></P><P>There are variations in the level and type
of tourist participation in nature-based activities.  For example,
`ecotourists' may include a mix of independent travellers, people who
travel in organised groups of a scientific, educational or recreational
nature, and individuals or families who are interested in an ecotourism
experience as part of a varied holiday.</P><P></P><P>A large
proportion of tourists attracted by the natural environment are in fact
not seeking a `total immersion' experience but rather wish to stay in an
urban or resort setting and venture out for short visits to observe
nature.  While such experiences are not generally considered ecotourism,
if effectively managed they can provide an efficient and sustainable
means for relatively large numbers of people to enjoy some exposure to
the natural environment with a much lower impact than would occur if
they were to seek a `total' nature-based experience involving camping
overnight and other outdoor activities.  </P><P></P><P>The market
profile for ecotourism requires more detailed analysis.  General
information can, however, be taken from available data such as visitor
surveys, the personal comments and perceptions of operators, and
international data. From these, the `ecotourist' appears to be well
educated, professional/semi-professional, 20-50 years of age,
independent and individualistic, looking for alternatives to the
traditional tourist destinations and experiences, and with significant
spending power.  It also appears that more females than males
participate in ecotourism activities. This information is, however,
based on limited sources and a more reliable profile of the ecotourist
is needed.</P><P></P><P>Supply</P><P></P><P>The supply of ecotourism
opportunities in Australia is largely undocumented and this has
implications for product development and marketing.  Growth will be
limited unless tourists are aware of the range of opportunities
available and their expectations are met.  Seasonal variation in
international visitation and domestic supply compounds the difficulty of
matching visitor expectations with available product.</P><P>There is
currently no complete inventory of ecotourism operators and products in
Australia, although recent publications such as <I>Ecotourism and
Nature Based Holidays </I>(Richardson 1993) and the ATC's <I>Natural
Holiday Guide
</I>go part of the way to meeting this need.  </P><P></P><P>In public
consultations for this Strategy, there was a consistent view that
ecotourism should be supply driven in response to the capacity of
natural areas to deliver sustainable tourism experiences.  An emphasis
on effective planning and management will help to ensure the continued
supply of ecotourism opportunities and a stable future for the industry.</P><P
></P><P>Demand</P><P></P><P>The exact size and nature of the market
for ecotourism is uncertain.  Interest in the natural environment,
however, is indicated in the International Visitor Survey conducted by
the Bureau of Tourism Research and in the ATC's market segmentation
studies.  The results suggest that international tourists rank factors
such as beautiful scenery, vastness, cleanliness, natural wonders,
wildlife and good beaches as major attributes influencing their choice
of Australia as a travel destination.  Over 85 per cent of Japanese
visitors ranked these factors as important, and over 70 per cent of
European and American long-haul travellers identified similar attributes
as key elements in their travel decisions.  </P><P></P><P>Many
visitors desire an authentic Australian experience that is different to
their everyday lives.  In addition, ATC research indicates a discernible
shift away from highly urbanised locations to relatively undeveloped
places of natural beauty.  The growth in visitation to national parks
and World Heritage areas supports this trend.  For example, visits to
national parks in Victoria exceeded 10 million in 1990-91 and are
increasing by 1 million annually (Victorian Department of Conservation
and Environment 1992).  </P><P></P><P>The primary role of nature in
attracting tourists to specific destinations is generally understood and
utilised.  However, more accurate measurement is required of the
significance of the environment in influencing international visitors to
choose Australia as a destination.  Also, further study is needed into
the perceived and realised benefits to the tourist of this form of
tourism (Valentine 1992).  </P><P></P><P>Conventional measures of
marketing success, such as visitor numbers and length of stay, are not
always appropriate for ecotourism.  Quality of experience and visitor
satisfaction are perhaps more appropriate to this type of tourism.</P><P>
</P><P>The need for qualitative data, such as that flowing from visitor
motivation and satisfaction studies, has also been identified by
ecotourism operators since most operators have limited opportunity and
capacity to undertake research into distant or untapped markets.  With
improved marketing knowledge, operators can make more realistic choices
about their target markets and develop specific markets ahead of
Australia's competition.</P><P></P><P>Market development will also be
enhanced by a greater understanding of the motivations and expectations
of domestic ecotourists since most tourist activity in Australia is
generated domestically and most operators work predominantly with this
market.   </P><P></P><P>Actions</P><UL>

Industry standards and accreditation
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>As discussed in chapter 3, `ecotourism' has
been used to describe a variety of tourism products, services and
experiences, ranging from any nature-based activity to those with a
strong emphasis on environmental sustainability and a high interpretive
content.  This variation is evident in standards of service delivery,
differences in ecotourism practices and approaches to marketing.</P><P></P><P
>Diversity in standards has prompted some ecotourism operators and
natural resource managers to call for accreditation systems for
accommodation, tour guides and field operations that would identify
their products in the marketplace, enhance the desirability of products
and minimise impact on the natural environment.  </P><P></P><P>Accreditation
systems involve formal acknowledgment of adherence to agreed standards
and would:</P><UL>
<LI>encourage the delivery of high-quality, sustainable tourism
products and the provision of accurate interpretive services;</LI>
<LI>enhance the reputation of Australian ecotourism in domestic and
international markets;</LI>
<LI>acknowledge the use of sustainable practices by ecotourism
operators to provide a marketing advantage; and</LI>
<LI>allow natural resource managers to monitor ecotourism operations
and guides working within their region.</LI></UL><P></P><P>National
accreditation systems could provide a basis for industry self-regulation
and provide consumers with useful information on which to make
comparative assessments of different enterprises and activities.</P><P>The
introduction of such systems would be complicated if a large number of
agencies were involved.  Presently, involved agencies could include
educational institutions, industry associations, government agencies,
conservation groups, training bodies, indigenous groups and professional
associations.  The range of interests of these agencies and the
diversity of locations would make it difficult to develop national
standards that also address site specific concerns, although more
specialised criteria could be developed and applied at the local level
if required.  One option could be to set up an advisory body that would
ensure a wide range of expertise was fed into the process.</P><P></P><P>
If accreditation systems are to be successful in the long term they
should be financially self-sufficient, although in the short term
government funding may be used to provide the initial impetus for
developing suitable systems in consultation with industry.  For example,
the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia has a national tour guide
accreditation scheme which was established with Federal Government
assistance.  Such a scheme could be developed to deliver specialised
modules for ecotourism training and accreditation.</P><P></P><P>Accreditation
systems need to be developed and implemented by the industry in
conjunction with existing training and accreditation bodies such as
Tourism Training Australia.  This organisation can provide general
advice to industry associations on the development and implementation of
core competencies and standards.</P><P></P><P>Pearson (submission 582)
suggests that tour operators, guides and educators should be licensed
and trained under an appropriate national standard, and then should be
able to operate under a regional or local code of practice determined by
the natural resource management agencies responsible for the day-to-day
control of natural tourism assets.  Pearson also recommends that
education courses and guidelines be established for the setting up of
sustainable ecotourism business enterprises.</P><P></P><P>The success
of ecotourism accreditation systems will depend on the degree to which
industry standards meet the expectations of consumers and natural
resource managers.  This may involve a cost to the operator (such as
undertaking additional training or implementing energy efficient
operating systems) in meeting these agreed industry standards.  </P><P></P><P

</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>Appropriate tourism behaviour contributes to
high-quality tourism and brings the greatest possible benefit to all
participants--travellers, the host population and the tourism
business--without causing intolerable ecological and social damage. 
Sustainable tourism can be achieved partly by educating tourists about
the consequences of inappropriate behaviour.  It is the cumulative
effect of this behaviour that damages communities, cultures and natural
environments (Krippendorf 1984, p. 106).</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism
education can influence tourist and industry behaviour and assist the
long-term sustainability of tourist activity in natural areas.  The
development and delivery of education and interpretive services for
ecotourism requires:</P><UL>
<LI>well-trained operators and guides who can deliver accurate and
informative materials and presentations.  Tour leaders and operators
should have a good knowledge of ecology, cultural issues, conservation
and minimal impact practices, and be skilful in interpretation. 
Initiatives like the National Adventure Guiding Project commissioned by
the Australian Committee for Training Curriculum will go part of the way
to addressing this need.  This also links with accreditation;</LI>
<LI>multifaceted approaches to appeal to all visitors, regardless of
educational background or prior knowledge of the environment;</LI>
<LI>easily accessible, accurate and stimulating information (pre-travel
and during the ecotourism experience) to encourage responsible behaviour
and an ongoing interest in tourism, the environment and conservation
after the visit;</LI>
<LI>interactive learning models, such as role-plays and other
participative techniques.  These lead to the greatest information
retention, especially if combined with supporting discussions and
pictures or films (Oliver 1991); and
</LI>
<LI>the messages conveyed by television and documentary films to be
based on ecological sustainability and appropriate for the environments
involved.  The visual media can be a very powerful and effective way of
conveying best practice and increasing environmental understanding.</LI></UL><P
></P><P>The success of the learning process can be measured in
behavioural change. Management goals will be assisted through more
thoughtful and informed use of natural areas by visitors and operators. 
Ecotourism can provide a means for a wide audience to develop an
understanding of the natural world and its conservation.

>5.10 Involvement of indigenous Australians
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>Interest in cultural diversity is integral to
the desire for ecotourism experiences and provides an opportunity for
indigenous Australians to be involved in ecotourism.  A 1993 Australia
Council study of international visitors and Aboriginal arts revealed
that a substantial number of international visitors to Australia were
interested in seeing and learning about Aboriginal arts and culture at
their source as well as in museums and art galleries.  Any ecotourism
ventures that involve indigenous Australians should be developed through
a process of consultation and negotiation with Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander communities, ensuring that they have the opportunity to
make decisions about the nature of their involvement.</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism
relies on people being able to experience natural and cultural resources
in an environmentally sensitive manner.  This is often done in areas
considered to be `wilderness'.  A substantial proportion of such areas
is owned by indigenous Australians in regions such as Cape York
Peninsula, central Australia, the Kimberley region and the Northern
Territory.</P><P></P><P>Because of its focus on natural and cultural
resources and its emphasis on minimal impact tourism, usually involving
small groups and valuing the expertise of the guide, ecotourism offers
an opportunity for indigenous Australians to be involved in tourism on
their own terms should they so desire.
</P><P></P><P>Indigenous participation in ecotourism has the potential
to provide many social and economic benefits, depending on the level of
involvement.  The exposure of aspects of Aboriginal lifestyle, culture
and mythology to tourists helps to promote interracial understanding. 
It also provides employment opportunities for indigenous Australians,
and so contributes to economic self-sufficiency, in areas such as
service delivery, management, interpretation, ranger activities,
recording and management of sacred sites and other culturally important
places, construction of visitor facilities and preparation of management
plans.</P><P></P><P>However, the potential economic benefits of
tourism may be offset by related social and cultural costs to Aboriginal
communities (Western Australian Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority,
submission 130).  Consultation with indigenous communities during the
planning stage will assist an understanding of what ecotourism involves
and help to minimise impacts.</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism is not always
appropriate for all indigenous communities. Successful participation by
indigenous Australians will depend on achieving a long-term balance
between three variables:  commercial success, the resilience of cultural
integrity and social cohesion, and the maintenance of the physical
environment.</P><P></P><P>Native title, initially recognised by the
High Court, was given further recognition and protection by the passage
of the Commonwealth Government's
<I>Native Title Act 1993</I>.  The Act protects indigenous peoples'
native title rights and interests over traditional lands.  As many of
these areas are currently Crown land or national parks, it is expected
that native title will have implications for the development of
indigenous tourism and ecotourism.</P><P></P><P>National Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander Tourism Strategy</P><P></P><P>In line with
the Government's commitments under the National Tourism Strategy, and in
response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) and the
Department of Tourism are jointly developing a National Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander Tourism Strategy.  </P><P></P><P>A Tourism
Industry Advisory Committee has been established to develop the
strategy, which is expected to be available in draft form by mid-1994. 
The Committee is made up of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
representatives, tourism operators, and representatives of tourism
industry organisations and Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies,
and is chaired by an ATSIC commissioner.</P><P></P><P>It is intended
that the strategy include information on employment and training, the
development of economic opportunities and the nature of tourism. Because
many potential indigenous tourism products will be ecotourism based, the
National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tourism Strategy will be
linked to the <I>National Ecotourism Strategy </I>and programs.</P><P></P><P
>The Tourism Industry Advisory Committee considers it important to
involve regional and remote communities and tourism industry operators
in the process of developing the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Tourism Strategy.  It has met in varied locations to facilitate
this involvement.</P><P></P><P>The Committee has determined that,
before detailed work can begin on the development of the strategy, there
is a need for more information on the current level of indigenous
involvement in the industry.  To this end, two major consultancies have
been commissioned to provide national statistical and attitudinal data
on such involvement.</P><P></P><P>A multimedia campaign calling for
submissions to the Committee (`Have your Say') was undertaken in May
1993.  In addition, in February 1994 the Committee distributed an issues
paper to stimulate further discussion.  </P><P></P><P>As an initiative

>5.11 Viability
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism has the potential to be
economically beneficial on a national level by attracting inbound
visitors (thus generating foreign exchange), by encouraging domestic
tourism, and through the creation of local employment and markets. 
These national economic impacts are discussed in chapter 4.</P><P></P><P>
It appears that the structure of parts of the tourism industry favours
large-scale activity, especially in market research and product
distribution. Although ecotourism is generally suited to small-scale
operations and personalised service it is not necessarily profitable
even though the price per day to the visitor may be comparatively high. 
This raises concerns about the long-term viability of some ecotourism
ventures.  </P><P></P><P>Many of the challenges and impediments to
establishing ecotourism businesses are similar to those applying to
other small tourism operations:</P><UL>
<LI>Minimal impact practices can involve additional costs since
recycling and waste minimisation services are not easily available in
some areas.</LI>
<LI>Economies of scale, which may affect the cost of maintaining an
office or undertaking market research, are often not available to small
operators.</LI>
<LI>Small developments may be less profitable because the provision of
environmentally responsible facilities and services may be more
cost-effective on a large scale.</LI>
<LI>The distance from markets and the seasonal nature of some
operations increases distribution and promotion costs.</LI>
<LI>Public liability insurance has proved to be expensive for many
ecotourism operators.</LI>
<LI>Small operators are required to have a range of skills to lead
tours, manage an office and interact in the marketplace, as it is not
possible to employ specialists in each of these areas.</LI></UL><P></P><P>
Although these factors may represent additional costs to operators, they
are a necessary part of ecotourism.  Viability may be improved by
operating on a large scale, although large visitor numbers may produce
unsustainable levels of impact and a failure of the experience to meet
visitor expectations of ecotourism.  Some minimum impact practices--for
example, energy conservation, use of alternative fuels and water
conservation--would be economically advantageous in the long term; small
operators could also investigate the possibility of collective
purchasing or asset sharing to achieve economies of scale.</P><P></P><P>
The viability of ecotourism operations is frequently affected by the
availability of adequate capital.  Difficulty in attracting financing
often occurs because business planning is inadequate.  This can be
addressed through greater access to existing business development
programs (for example, the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation's
Self-Help Training Package).  In addition, approaches such as
accreditation may enable operators to compete more effectively in the
marketplace.  </P><P></P><P>Many operators view their businesses in
lifestyle terms and believe there is a need to assess viability in ways
other than net profit.  Ecotourism operations will fail, however, if
profits do not adequately cover costs and risk.  </P><P></P><P>There
is considerable potential to overcome or minimise the impediments to the
viability of ecotourism operations.  Many of the actions identified in
this paper will positively assist operators to become more viable.  </P><P>

Equity considerations
</A></H2>
<P>Issues</P><P></P><P>Ecotourism is one of the purposes for which
some public and private land can be utilised.  Alternatives include
commerce, recreation, cultural activity and conservation.  Ecotourism is
compatible with some of these uses but may also, at times, conflict with
them.  Forms of land use may also have differing equity implications for
community and business groups.</P><P></P><P>A number of approaches are
available to manage access and protect fragile areas, including:</P><UL>
<LI>control of visitor flows--for example, advance bookings, queuing,
or the use of a ballot or other forms of quotas.  These approaches are
not based on the ability of the tourist to pay for access to an area;
and</LI>
<LI>economic instruments--for example, user charges, development
charges, access rights or tradeable permits, subsidies, or rates or
taxes that place some kind of value on resources.  Economic instruments
can be used to fund management of natural areas, manage the level of
visitation or control tourism impacts.  </LI></UL><P></P><P>Equity
considerations relate to the distribution of the costs and benefits
associated with various uses of public resources and the balance of
these costs and benefits. 
</P><P></P><P>Failure to use economic instruments may mean a heavier
burden on the wider community through taxes, with the main benefits
accruing to tourists and operators (who may not directly support the
resource).  On the other hand, economic instruments bear more heavily on
low-income groups because they are not generally adjusted on an income
basis.</P><P></P><P>Each of these options will be subject to practical
constraints.  These are often site specific and relate to available
access, topography, management regimes, the administrative costs of
collection and alternative management priorities.  </P><P></P><P>The
control of visitor flows or use of economic instruments may have
implications for operators' marketing and financial planning--for
example, operators may be required to offer definite schedules for a
minimum of three years in order to participate in the international
market, as well as five-year business plans for financial institutions
(On Track Consultants, submission 556; and Richardson, submission 578).
 </P><P></P><P>Management of equitable access to the natural
environment will depend on the resilience of the environment and its
capacity to sustainably accommodate tourists, as well as on management
priorities, since resources may be valuable for reasons other than
revenue generation.  </P><P></P><P>The use of particular management
tools will be constrained by administrative issues such as methods of
collection and whether the cost of collection is high relative to the
revenue raised.  </P><P></P><P>A mixture of techniques, depending on
the particular circumstances of the site, could be used to allow access
to ecotourism opportunities for all tourists. The use of these
techniques should be equitable and consistent, linked to an actual
service provided and capable of cost-effective implementation.</P><P></P><P

</A></H3>
<P>This program will provide assistance for projects--such as baseline
studies, predictive modelling and monitoring--that assess and contribute
to the management of changes to natural environments caused, or likely
to occur, as a result of ecotourism.  Such research activities link with
improved management practice.</P><P></P><P>Objective</P><UL>
<LI>Encourage the establishment of indicators and the collection of
data at ecotourism destinations to provide a more informed basis for
decisions by planners, operators and natural resource managers.</LI></UL><P>
</P><H3><A NAME="RTFToC116">Program G:	Integrated Regional Planning
</A></H3>
<P>This program will fund pilot projects or case studies that
demonstrate the effective integration of ecotourism planning at the
regional level.  Projects will involve collaborative approaches between
local communities, natural resource managers, local governments and
other levels of government.</P><P></P><P>Objectives</P><UL>
<LI>Incorporate ecotourism into the regional planning process and
provide examples of integrated approaches that can be readily adapted by
other areas.</LI>
<LI>Sustain the long-term future of ecotourism in regional Australia by
encouraging recognition that ecosystems cross more than one
administrative unit or local government area.</LI></UL><P></P><H3><A NAME="RTFToC117"
>Program H:	Business Development
</A></H3>
<P>This program will aim to improve the level of business skills among
ecotourism operators through workshops, short courses or distance
education modules focusing on business practices and ecotourism
management issues. </P><P></P><P>Objectives</P><UL>
<LI>Improve the business skills and environmental knowledge base of
ecotourism operators and so increase the viability of operators and
their capacity to provide ecotourism experiences in an ecologically
sustainable manner.</LI>
<LI>Encourage the establishment of networks for cooperative marketing,
purchasing and skill sharing to provide competitive advantages for small
or developing ecotourism businesses.</LI></UL><P></P><H3><A NAME="RTFToC118"
>Program I:	Conferences and Workshops
</A></H3>
<P>Limited support will be available to assist the organisation of
major national and international ecotourism conferences in Australia. 
Funding may also be provided for regional workshops or to produce
material that can be distributed in Australia and overseas.</P><P></P><P>
Objectives</P><UL>
<LI>Broaden knowledge of ecotourism, including current trends in
ecotourism planning, development and management (both in Australia and
overseas), across the community.</LI>
<LI>Promote the application of best practice in ecotourism planning,
development and management by facilitating access to high-quality,
practical information.</LI>
<LI>Encourage the exchange of views to help ecotourism operators to
form networks and address common problems through cooperative or
collaborative projects.</LI></UL><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC119">6.3
Realising the vision
</A></H2>
<P>Australia is well advanced in its development of policy and
commitment to planning for ecotourism, as reflected in the policies of
State, Territory and local governments and through the interest of the
industry, land managers, conservation groups and individuals in
contributing to the development of this Strategy.  Steps toward
translating these policies and planning initiatives into practice are
identified in the objectives and actions in this Strategy.
</P><P></P><P>The implementation of this Strategy, through the actions
outlined in this chapter and the continuing development of complementary
strategies and programs by other agencies, will direct Australia towards
an ecologically and culturally sustainable ecotourism industry and, at
the same time, make a major contribution to environmental conservation
and management.</P><P></P><H2><A NAME="RTFToC120">APPENDIX A

<TITLE>30,000yen Unlimited ISDN 64K Access</TITLE>
<body bgcolor=#FFFFFF>
<IMG SRC=crisscross.gif>

<H3>The wait is over!</H3>

<FONT SIZE=4>It came from a hole in the road dug by NTT, through a rather ordinary pipe, up to the sixth floor, 
through the celing and down into a sinister, very expensive,  black box. There it sits humming softly like the 
sentinel in 2001. But what is it? Oh no! It can't be! It's.....<b>64K ISDN access from CRISSCROSS!!</b>

<P>We are happy to announce that we have completed installation of 92 64k ISDN lines into CRISSCROSS tower. 
We can pass on the benefits of our new technology directly to you, offering full 64K ISDN unlimited access 
for one year at what we think is the lowest price in Japan - 30,000yen. This is in line with our commitment to 
fast, friendly and reasonable internet services.

<P>We have upgraded all of our servers to 166MHz Pentium machines running Windows NT, ensuring that our 
customers have trouble-free email and speedy access.

<P><b>What is ISDN?</b>

<P>ISDN is a system for sending digital signals over ordinary metallic telephone lines, like the one in 
your home. One metallic line can have two 64K channels which can be combined to make a rather speedy 128K access. 

<P>If your current modem is 28.8kbps you will be able to access the web and download files almost 
<b>THREE TIMES FASTER.</B>

That makes me29.</P><P>I grew up in a small town called Irvine, 30 miles south ofGlasgow. It's on the sea. Scotland is a beautiful country.</P><P>I don't remember my childhood very much. I remember I had aChopper bike. It was cool. One day I fell off on some gravel andscraped my arm. I was never very close to my parents. They are prettyyoung. My father has been sick most of his adult life and doesn'twork. My mother works in an office.</P><P>I went to Strathclyde University when I was 16. I took a five-yearcourse called Manufacturing Sciences and Engineering. I met MaryMcQueen-Molloy (now Mary Devlin), my partner, on my first day atuniversity. We have gone through a lot but we're still together andhaving fun after 13 years. <IMG SRC="SparkyTheBoyGenius.gif"WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=234 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeightALIGN=left></P><P>The picture on the left was taken in August 1968. Such a cutie!</P><P>We moved to Glasgow in 1984. Glasgow was undergoing a hugecultural renewal and the spirt of the city was very positive.</P><P>We had to work in the summer as a course requirement. I worked at<A HREF="http://www.linn.co.uk">Linn Products</A>, a famous hi-ficompany and at GEC where everyone in the office stared at the walland I screwed accelerometers into the inside of power stationgenerators. You can feel the power.</P><P>In 1985 I went to Live Aid at Wembley.</P><P>Manufacturing Sciences was too hard so I left after four yearswith an Honours degree in Production Engineering and Management. Ihad the idea I wanted to start a recording studio. I got 11,000poundsas a loan from the bank but we could not find suitable premises. Iknew I had to leave Glasgow to get a decent job.</P><P>I decided to come to Japan because London was too near. I soldsome tape recorders that I got from the university for free and leftwith 400pounds in my pocket. When I went to the bank in Tokyo I had abig problem-half of the notes were Scottish and useless.</P><P>I worked as an English teacher for Time/Life. I was always missingclasses because it's natural for me to stay up late. One day I wentdrinking with my students-they had to carry me home.</P><P>Then I was an editor of financial reports.</P><P>I left that job on Tuesday and was hired on Thursday to be managerof a PC network for East West Consulting. I also did some financialanalysis for them. I left them because they had a policy of takingone day off of your holiday if you were late more that five times inone month. I really did try, but...In that month I worked 17 hoursovertime. I was late a total of 15 minutes. They took one day off. Ileft.</P><P>I was unemployed for four months and getting a bit desperate. Itook the advice of one of my headhunter friends and started callinground companies instead of waiting for letters. Bingo! In 2 weeks Iwas Network Manager for Jardine Fleming Securities. They had about100 Macs which acted as a giant fax machine. The analyst would visita company, write the report into a template, hit the button and itwould be faxed to hundreds of clients around the world.</P><P>I like computing not computers.</P><P>My favourite book is Angel Love by Tadanori Yokoo. His photoshoppaintings are great and it has something special about it. It's agood present 'cos it's in Japanese and English and it only costs&#165;1999!</P><P>I am very optimistic person. I truly believe that anything ispossible. That makes me hard on people sometimes. I also like toanalyse things a lot.</P><P>Around this time I discovered Techno. It's a shame Tokyo clubsdon't play more positive energy dance music. The best</P><P>Simplicity, Reuse of a few core elements and</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>I don't drink much and don't like smoking anything. I don't likecoffee.</P><P>In the past I used to like fast, positive energy techno. Now Iprefer slower, more emotional tracks. Emotional Techno? Try RenegadeLegion's "The Weeping Waste'. The best peice of music ever made thatI heard today.</P><P>My contract at Jardine Fleming ran out and I thought I was goingto have to look for another job, but they rehired me as a consultant.I became the world's most highly paid Filemaker Pro programmer. I wasmaking databases for them for 17,000yen ($170) an hour.</P><P>So I only worked a few days in a month. Until they gave me a lotof work at once. Mary had been working at UBS but when her contractfinished, due to the gloomy Tokyo market she had trouble finding ajob. I had money for the first time.</P><P>A few years ago I went back to Scotland to take my motorbike test.My mother's husband decided to have a physical fight with me becauseI was on the phone too long. Local call. My dad found out and blamedme for what happened and disowned me. He apologised later and we talknow. I don't have any contact with Ruth, my sister. She is 24 andlives in England.</P><P>In September 1993 Mary and I started Tokyo Classified with afriend. He had to pull out later. We used our own money which wasn'treally enough. We also started STROBE, a free paper about the TokyoUnderground party scene. We run parties too. They are a lot of fun.We are currently building an internet version of Strobe. It will comeout in the new year.</P><P>I used to play the guitar pretty well, but I gave it up to makeTechno. I have a studio in my apartment. I have not recorded manytracks, but what I have recorded has been well received. I was veryhappy when I heard my track on Tokyo Pirate FM. I used to play itevery few days. I'm not making music at the moment because I don'thave a computer at home and I can't afford to buy one.</P><P><IMG SRC="Wedding.gif" WIDTH=227 HEIGHT=374 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=right></P><P>I only started to work on Tokyo Classified seriously after I cameback from India. At that time I was designing each issue and makingall the ads using Quark XPress. I also designed the companyinformation system (which needs to be updated).</P><P>When we first started we had to go to National Azabu, write downall the ads on the noticeboard and put them in the issue. We had over1000 classifieds in the</P><P>I drive a Steed 400cc motorbike. I live in Bunkyo-ku on the sixthfloor. I like looking out over the city and lying in bed looking atthe sky. I don't like ornamentation so the place is stark. I have nodesire to have children.</P><P>We have been publishing for almost two years. We have seven staffand a leased line. We moved into a big office and need some cactus tomake it more homely.</P><P>We have been working on<A HREF="/tokyoclassified/Default.html">Tokyo Classified</A>, ourinternet classified ads system for a while and just released it tothe public. So far so good. It's hungry for ads so please feed it. Wehave all been working hard and we hope to see rewards in a fewmonths. The big news is that Mary and I got married in September.Sometimes you just have to grab onto something good.</P><P>Things I'd like to do:</P><UL>   <LI>Skydive (well we did this in Hawaii the day after we got   married)      <LI>Buy the ultimate hi-fi and the room to play it in      <LI>Make a good album      <LI>Go to the beach      <LI>Write the book-It's coming along</UL><P>Remember, in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is deaf.</P><P>So now you know...<BR>But maybe I just made it all up.</P><P>Sparky &lt;..&gt;<BR><BR><BR><BR><IMG SRC="SparkyProduct.gif" WIDTH=451 HEIGHT=36 X-SAS-UseImageWidthX-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></P><P>Copyright Mark Devlin 1997</P><P>Any comments?

<p><font SIZE=-2>Modified May 30, 1996</font></p>
<h2 align=center>---Welcome to Alex's Home-Page---</h2>

<p>
<hr></p>

<p><font SIZE=+2>What is the <b>Post Modern Juxtaposer's Society</b> (besides just a hokey name)
? I'm hoping that it is as yet undefined, and that it's name will keep it like
that for some time. The name itself should both define it's members and
keep it's members from being truly defined. We are post-modern it that
we accept that we are not simply defined, and do not define ourselves by
one label. We create ourselves from childhood by what we see around us,
and not by just one image, but by several, dozens, hundreds, or perhpas
millions of them. We juxtapose these images one over the other, taking
a bit from each to create ourselves, both our self image and the image
we show others. We recreate ourselves continuously every day. In this recreation,
it appears that we are all a bunch of posers, people who take on new styles,
for whatever reason, that seem strange when contrasted with the styles
that we used to have. Of course, we have all done this to some degree or
another, and not just in the fashion sense, but in a perceptual and philosophical
sense. You are probably not the same as you were at age 5, but are you
still the same person? Is there some core you that remains as the other
aspects of you change? You could say that some people are bigger posers
than others, but I can't help but see everyone as such. Now I ask you,
we ask you, is this wrong? Tell us what you think and believe. </font></p>

<p>
<hr></p>

<p><font SIZE=+2>Actually, I have had a bit of input on this while off-line,
from a very artistic and gothic friend here in Tokyo. She found the whole
idea of taking on new identities, posing in a sense, depressing especially
when it involved anything commercial. Tokyo is an especially commercially
oriented city, and both of us often find ourselves trying to escape this,
but I could point out many instances where we had failed. I then began
to discuss with her how I found it difficult to devote myself to any particular
art form, when it is almost always commercialized. For instance, a Blues
song that was once probably an incredible expression of the artist's life
has now become the theme music for a whiskey commerical. Rolling Stone's
songs sell beer (and the operating system that I use). I cannot help but think that NIN will be used to advertise
chocolate chip cookies someday. What is new, outside, different and original
today is used to sell things tomorrow, or at least the essense of it is
stolen and used. Of course, it is depressing, but I think it is so because
we stake too much of our identities on these external expressions. Does
a particular type of music or art express you or a part of you? Well then,
of course you're going to be upset when you wake up in a few months and
find that a picture that moved you, that touched something in your heart,
is glued to the outside of a roll-on deodorant. I wouldn't mind writing
down my personal answers to these questions here (my own philosophy), but
I don't want to yet. I want more imput from you. The PMJS is a place to
discuss such things, not a church where the answers are given. I doubt
that my answers would satisfy you anyway, since they are just that; mine.
I should say that I am not usually depressed by the posing I see around
me, and for the most part, neither are my close friends. How do you deal
with the modern world (or post-modern, or whatever), or do you even try?
</font></p>

<p>
<hr></p>

<p><font SIZE=+2>Interested at all in my <i><a href="http://www.crisscross.com/users/aleaxndr/biography">biography?</a></i>
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>As I'm writing this, I'm listening to <a href="http://www.realaudio.com/contentp/npr.html ">National
Public Radio</a> which is not that strange except that I'm listening to
it in my apartment in Tokyo, Japan through my new Pentium 166 with 28.8 modem.
  This is a big improvement over my old PowerMac 7100/66 which only had a 14.4 modem
and was falling behind in the new technologies race on the internet.  Don't get me wrong, 
it was very difficult giving up my Mac and its ease of use, but I saw the future (at least
 an immediate future) where I will have to know the Windows operating system.  Anyway, 
I use a program called RealAudio to listen to NPR and it works very well.  I love keeping up
 with the latest news, and this allows me to even while I'm in Japan.  Best of all, it's all free,
 so check it out.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>So, I'm studying on an exchange program in Tokyo, Japan
at Sophia University and I only have about 2 more months left!  I really can't wait to 
get away from this school and back to UCSD.  Of course, Sophia is not entirely bad (there 
are a couple of exceptionally good teachers of non-Japanese language courses), but I
 came here to learn Japanese and I don't think that their program is very good.  I guess
 that I had just hoped for a lot more...</font></p>


<p>
<hr></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>My older sister lives and works in Portland Oregon. Her
best friend opened an alternative music store a few years back that is very good
. They have a vary large selection of hard to get recordings, and they can special order 
<i>anything.</i>
They are even on the web...<a href="http://www.teleport.com/~ozone/">The
Ozone.</a> </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>I think that eventually I'm going to set up a couple of
different pages that will relate to different subjects, like a page for
stories contributed by friends, a page for my own philosophical impressions,
and pages for things I've yet to <b>consider</b>. So, send your ideas to
me, or your stories, and I'll put them on my pages.</font></p>

<p>
<hr></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Two of my good friends, Travis and James, work at a great
little computer company called PFMagic in San Francisco. I worked there
a bit a long time ago (I painted a wall in one of their offices) but they've
since grown quite a bit. They have a great new program for your computer
that gives you a pet to play with <a href="http://fido.dogz.com/dogz/">Dogz</a>.
The founder of the company, Rob something or other, wrote Demon Attack
and the Atari 2600 version of Missle Command which I loved to play when
I was in the third grade. So check out!</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>This is my new home-page, my first attempt ever at writing
one (I think I'm getting the hang of HTML), and I'm wondering what everyone

<HTML><TITLE> Crisscross 20,000 Unlimited Access</TITLE><BODY bgcolor=#FFFFFF><CENTER><IMG SRC=Unlimited.gif><IMG SRC=UnlimitedE.gif><H3>Why you should choose Crisscross... </H3>The two most important which are important when choosing an internet provider:<BR> bandwidth and modem ratio. <H3>10:1 Modem ratio</H3>Modem ratio refers to the number of telephone lines with a modem, in relation to the number of members. A modem ratio of one modem for every 10 users is considered to be a very good service. Some providers may only have a ratio of one modem to 30 users, which can mean busy signals and a long wait until lines become free for your connection<H3>High Bandwidth ratio</H3>Bandwidth refers to the capacity of the line available for the flow of data back and forth. If too many users try to use a limited bandwidth, the flow gets clogged, which means you have to wait.The bandwidth in relation to the number of users is much more important than not the absolute bandwidth. For example 128K for 200 users is better than 512K for 5,000 users.<H3>Our Guarantee</H3>At Crisscross we guarantee a modem ratio of 1 modem for every 10 users. We also guarantee to maintain our bandwidth ratio which means that you will spend less time waiting and more time finding the information you want.<H3>Plus...Technical Support in English</H3>Our technical support stsff are here to answer any of your questions. Call us or send email to <A HREF=mailto:support@crisscross.com>support@crisscross.com</A><P><HR></FONT></CENTER></BODY>

<TITLE>Making your Homepage!</TITLE>
<body bgcolor=#FFFFFF>
<IMG SRC=MakeHomePage.gif>

<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>
CRISSCROSS gives all our members 10 Megabytes of disk space free!
You can use this to make your own personal home page.
Read on to see how easy it is!
</FONT>
<P>
<HR>

<H3>FIRST THINGS FIRST...</H3>
<FONT SIZE=4>

The first thing you have to do is to <A HREF="mailto:support@crisscross.com">send us a note</A> asking us to set up a homepage directory for you.
    
<P>Then you can upload HTML files and graphics into your directory to a maximum of 10MB. You can upload and download files to the directory using any FTP compliant program. 

<P>For Macintosh you can download Fetch 
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>HOW TO CONNECT AND UPLOAD FILES</H3>
<P>Open your FTP program<BR>
Click 'Open Connection...' and fill in the following...
<BR>
<BR>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>Host:       <TD>ftp.crisscross.com or 202.243.58.6
<TR><TD>UserID:     <TD>Your UserID
<TR><TD>Password:   <TD>Your Password
<TR><TD>Directory:  <TD>/YourUserID/
</TABLE>
<P>Click OK.You will see the login screen. If you have a problem please email <A HREF=mailto:support@crisscross.com>support@crisscross.com</A>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>HOW TO MAKE YOUR HOME PAGE</H3>

<P>Webpages are made using HTML (HyperText Markup Language). You have to use HTML tags to format the page. You can use any text editor to write the tags, but if you are going to make a lot of pages we recommend you use a dedicated HTML editing program such as Adobe PageMill.

<P>Make a text file called "default.html". Copy the following into it:

<PRE>
<CODE>&lt;HTML&gt;</CODE>
<CODE>&lt;TITLE&gt;</CODE>My HomePage<CODE>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</CODE>
<CODE>&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=#123456&gt;</CODE>
<CODE>&lt;H1&gt;</CODE>This is my HomePage<CODE>&lt;/H1&gt;</CODE>
Hey this is cool! I've got my own page!
<CODE>&lt;A HREF=http://www.crisscross.com/&gt;</CODE>Where does this link go?<CODE>&lt;/A&gt;</CODE>
<CODE>&lt;/BODY&gt;</CODE>
<CODE>&lt;/HTML&gt;</CODE>
</PRE>

<P>Upload the file to your crisscross directory (format should be Raw Data). 


<P>You can access your homepage with the following URL: 
<B>http://www.crisscross.com/users/yourUserID/default.html</B>

<P>Remember that noone will see your page unless you give them the URL or they come through the crisscross users homepage. 

<P>Play around with the above and see what you can do. The best way to find out how to make your own pages is to look on the web itself! Have a look at the HTML guides in <A HREF=http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/Data_Formats/HTML/Guides_and_Tutorials/>yahoo</A>. There are lots of sites with buttons and graphics you can use (you can also take things from other websites by holding down the mouse button on the item and selecting 'copy to hard disk'. Please remember to ask for permission.

<P>Another useful tip is to go to a page which has a design you like and select View-Document Source from Netscape's menubar. You will see the HTML that makes up the page.

<P>To test your page before you put it on the web just drag the file onto Netscape. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>THINGS TO TRY</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Add your own text and play with text formating tags
<LI>Add a backgound pattern with <CODE>&lt;BODY BACKGOUND=MyBackground.jpg&gt;</CODE>  . You can find some <A HREF=http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/Programming/Backgrounds/>here</A>
    
<LI>Upload a graphic and make it display on the page 
        <B><CODE>&lt;IMG SRC=myphoto.gif&gt;</CODE></B>. 
<LI> Make a second page and make a link from the first to the second
        <B><CODE>&lt;A HREF=Page2&gt;</CODE>This is a link to page 2<CODE>&lt;/A&gt;</CODE></B>
<LI> Organise your work. Put all your graphics in a new folder called
        "Graphics" and call them using <B><CODE>&lt;IMG SRC=Graphics/Myphoto.gif&gt;</CODE></B>
</UL>
<BR>


<H3>THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Dont put any spaces in file names
<LI>A missing / or " can make a big difference. 
<LI>Graphics should be in gif or jpg format eg. mygraphic.gif or mygraphic.jpg
<LI>Test, test and test again BEFORE it goes on the web.
<LI>Ask a friend to help if you can't make graphics. Otherwise you may end up with the CRISSCROSS ugly page award :) 
<LI>Nothing commercial or immoral please.
<LI>No sex sites or sex links sites please.
</UL>


<P>If you are really stuck, send webpage problems to <A HREF=mailto:support@crisscross.com>support@crisscross.com</A>
<P>Once you have got your home page set up send us some email and we will add the address to the CRISSCROSS user homepage list.

<P>Happy pagemaking!
    
Sparky

    <P>Dr. Berger graduated from the <A HREF="http://www.uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</A> in 1980 with a double major in biology and pathobiology and a minor in anthropology. He obtained his M.D. from  <A HREF="http://www.nymc.edu/">New York Medical College</A> in 1985. He then completed a 4-year residency in psychiatry at New York Medical College from 1985-89.</P> 
     <P>After residency, Dr. Berger did a one-year fellowship at the <A HREF="http://www.aecom.yu.edu/">Albert Einstein College of Medicine</A> in New York and is currently an Assistant Professor of <A HREF="http://quark.aecom.yu.edu/psychlab/quark.htm">Psychiatry at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</A>  Dr. Berger's training included over 5 years of receiving supervision as a psychotherapist. He has had a private practice of psychiatry/psychotherapy since 1989, in addition to seven years of university hospital-based experience in the United States. Dr. Berger is Board Certified in Psychiatry from the <A HREF="http://www.psych.org/med_ed/abpn_sec1.html">American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.</A></P> 
     <P>Dr. Berger first came to Japan as a medical exchange student in 1985 where he studied psychiatry and neurology at <A HREF="http://mfs.med.u-tokai.ac.jp/medsch.html">Tokai University,</A> and as a researcher in psychiatry also at Tokai in 1988 on a grant from the <A HREF="http://www.ortge.ufl.edu/fyi/v22n19/fyi037.html">Matsumae International Foundation</A>. He has been in Japan now since 1992 as a psychotherapist and psychiatric researcher,  receiving a Ph.D. in Medical Science from <A HREF="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html">Tokyo University</A> in 1994 while on a research grant from the <A HREF="http://www.nih.gov/fic">U.S. National Institutes of Health</A> sponsored by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.  He is bilingual in English and Japanese.</P></A>
<P>
Dr. Berger often uses the metaphor of a computer with his patients. Although a computer has a garbage can to throw away unneeded or disturbing documents, humans have no way to permantly rid themselves of emotional waste. Humans can only rearrange their feelings and memories, though they often try to "forget" painful things. One of Dr. Berger's approaches is to help patients rearrange these ideas, memories, and their associated feelings in a better way than they have up to now using  a psychodynamic, object relational, and cognitive-behavioral framework.
<P>
Some other analogies Dr. Berger has noticed between the human mind and computers are: 1.) that there is an "unconscious" behind the screen that is doing things the user can't readily see that sometimes causes glitches;  2.) Programming a computer, or putting in the system software, is like bringing up and educating a child: resultant functioning reflects the initial input;  3.) If your hardware is broken, like in a stroke (actual brain damage), new software (experiences, learning, relationships) will usually not fix the damaged areas easily.  

Some differences between humans and computers is that although they do relate to each other (ie. networks), computers have no feelings, and they don't grow up, play, or romance with each other (not they have told us about yet).


<P>
About being in Japan, most of the problems seen in the foreign community seem to be part of difficulties people have had well before they came to Japan.  Although there are many stressful situations related to being a foreigner in Japan, and these can cause lots of frustration with the Japanese, some people seem to project <I>their own</I> problems onto the Japanese (ie. label them as the cause of their problems). Dr. Berger is now doing a study on expatriate adaptation and has developed the "Expatriate Adaptation Inventory" data base to look at a number of issues on living in Japan. One's stress, perception of stress, and ability to cope with stress are important factors that likely predict one's adaptation to foreign culture. Interest in the culture and language of Japan, and keeping a balance of Japanese and Western friends of both sexes, is of course, important to decrease stress and improve coping. When these fail, it is often important to look into that person's pattern of early relationships when they were growing-up, in addition to a possible biological basis for the problem.

<h3>Ambient Description</h3>

<table width=600><TR><TD>
<P align=left><font size=+1>October in Helsinki - it's cold and windy - the window of the MUU-Base is
almost closed, because someone nailed wooden panels across it - but the gaps
between the panels allow a look inside - the entrance is like always - you
enter the room.

It is a yellow-brownish light in that room - very bright -  and it is
rather hot (we can manage this becouse of the strong spots) - it is not 
very nice to breath because of the stickyness of the air  - it smells a 
little bit -  it's a long time ago since somebody let fresh air in. There 
are 3 big wooden boxes standing around - boxes which are used for transportation 
on cargo-ships. They are closed with big nails and they look like having been 
on a long journey - (may be this movie comes to your mind where they transport 
boxes filled with rotten dynamite) - the floor you walk on is soft - 
it is covered with earth, sawdust and dry hey which is obviously also inside 
the wooden boxes - you can see it coming through the cracks hindering you from
looking at the real content - an old metal gascan is in one corner - in 
the other one there are 3 metal cubes - parts of a machine - maybe to cool 
down something - 4 oiltins of 10 litres each, as used by  restaurants,  
are besides one wooden box - somebody took away the top so that they look like pails.</FONT SIZE=+1>
</TD></TR></table>

<H3>The Sound</H3>
<table width=600><TR><TD>
<P align=left><font size=+1>You have the feeling that there are a lot of insects caught inside these
objects - trying to get out - you hear every now and then this buzzing
getting louder, which happens when flying insects are clashing against a
thin metal wall or glass - when you look very carefully you see the tins
moving in this moments - but you hear also other sounds which remind you
immediately that you haven't been at the dentist's since to long - the
noises of dentists' drills in action - very soft, but impossible not to be

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2><FONT SIZE=+1><P ALIGN=LEFT>In 1993 we visited the Duchamp exhibition in Venice. One of the black&white movies shown
there had a short sequence of a female dancer jumping towards the observer. The shot was taken from underneath a glass plate with
the dancer jumping down on it from above. We found the sequence so appealing because of its reversal of orientation and
the irritation concerning the nature of the object which is visible. It reminded us of a blossoming flower, shot with a
time-lapse camera. Our intention was to create a whole video clip from variations of the observed situation and thereby
embrace the visitor with a pulsating imagery of quasi-abstract movement.

During a 3 weeks investigation on rhythmical patterns in the domain of sound and image we composed a video sequence
featuring steps from different people at various pace and gestural expression. In this way the steps being the main
constituent of the piece helped us to explore one bodily movement in detail: the approximation of a human foot to the
sensorium of the observer (i.e. the ear, the eye, but also the microphone, the video camera).</P>

Inside this sphere there was a microphone and a lamp. The microphone picked up the sounds of the river. The sounds were transfered into the gallery space, where a hemisphere was situated on the wall at visitors' eyelevel. The hemisphere contained a central hole inside which a loud-speaker and a little videomonitor have been placed. The loudspeaker emited the sound of the river, the video showed the scenary of the night, when the sphere was floating glimmering like a fallen moon on the river and fishes were swimming over this pictures. The original sounds were manipulated by a digital effects processor in realtime.The sphere on the river had to be fixed to the ground with an anchor. The glimmering sphere was not only a container for the microphone but also a nice object pointing to the exhibition at Titanik gallery.</P></FONT SIZE=+1></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2><A href="matsyl.htm"><B>fuchs-eckerman</B></A></TD></TR></TABLE><NOBR><A HREF="jump.htm"><IMG SRC="../links.gif" border=0></A><AHREF="rewind.htm"><IMG SRC="../rechts.gif" border=0></A></NOBR></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

The location of the SAFE changed its shapeduring 14 days in September 1993. A series of artists transformed the visual and acoustical appearance of the SAFEdaily. The REWIND project was presented at the last day of the exhibition series. The idea was to store/save thechanges having taken place during the previous fortnight, i.e. different szenarios created by the artists and thechanges coming from visitors and the light situation during the day. This freeze-frame pictures and sounds were madeavailable whenever somebody came in and wanted to go for a trip - not in space but in time. Each day we took a number of video-stills and of tape recordings which threw a glance at the place. All the sounds andpictures taken were then  fed into an interactive program, which we exhibited on the fourteenth day of the exhibitionseries.The REWIND project set up a scenario which mainly consisted of the SAFE itself and the memorized sights and sounds ofthe SAFE. A Macintosh computer and four loudspeakers served as the memory of the room. The visitor who entered wasencouraged to navigate in the room's memory by typing commands into the computer. In this way he was able to make thesounds and sights of the recent past audible and visible at his own will.</FONT SIZE=+1><BR></P><P align="left"><A href="matsyl.htm"><B>fuchs-eckerman</B></A><center><NOBR><A HREF="moon.htm"><IMG SRC="../links.gif" border=0></A><AHREF="link.htm"><IMG SRC="../rechts.gif" border=0></A></NOBR></center></HTML></BODY>

The project LINK attempted to draw attention to the locality of a staircase. We showed the piece in
Bolzano/ Italy,
Vienna/ Austria and Helsinki. Each site wass equipped with a different soundtrack accompaning the
visitor on his way up
or down the stairs. Also the buildings housing the stairs and the stairs themselves were different: a
metal staircase
construction in Vienna; classicist stone stairs in Bolzano and a large multi-winged staircase in
Helsinki. The orange
carpet however linked the different locations like a red thread. For ISEA 94 in Helsinki  we choose
the staircase of
the Museum of Contemporary Art as the project location. The sounds of walking people which were
usually audible on the
stairs, were superimposed by sounds especially designed for the specific circumstances.<BR> 

By covering the staircase with an orange carpet we confronted the visitors with a new sensual
impression when walking
up the stairs. Not only had their auditory environment changed - the visual and tactile surroundings
seemed altered as
well. As a consequence of the alterations in the audio-visual environment we  achieved a fundamental
change of the
visitors'  perception of the location.<BR>

Over one-third of psychiatrists had some agreement with the statement, "It is valuable to accept a medical patients decision to die even if depressed." Physician assisted suicide was approved of most often in cases of terminal illness/no depression (41%), and termination of life-support was considered as "letting the patient die naturally" by 62%.  Psychiatrists with fewer years of experience felt that only rarely or sometimes was distorted thinking or psychopathology involved in medical patients wishes to die and were more likely to rate termination of life support as "letting the patient die naturally".     <p> These results point to an influence on Japanese psychiatrists of the Japanese cultural value of duty and responsibility to others as equal to that of life itself and raise the importance of sensitizing Japanese doctors and legal systems to the relationship of psychopathology with suicidal ideation and to the effect of depression on patient's medical decisions.  Other cultural factors affecting these issues and recommendations for future research are discussed.<P>INTRODUCTION   <P> In 1961 in Japan, the son of a hospitalized man suffering from severe pain after a stroke mixed a cup of milk with insecticide and arranged for his unsuspecting mother to give this to the patient, who had requested that his son assist him in dying. The son could not endure his father's condition and killed him in order to show his love1.     <P> In 1962, the Nagoya High Court outlined six conditions that must be met for a killing to be recognized as euthanasia. 1.) Terminal illness and approaching death. 2.) Unbearable Suffering. 3.) The purpose of the euthanasia is to relieve suffering. 4.) If lucid, then the the patient must have consented to, and requested the euthanasia. If not lucid, the person's family has made  a proxy request. 5.) The euthanasia must be performed by a physician or with full consent of the patient in the rare case where a physician is not able to preform the procedure. 6.) The methods used must be ethically acceptable.   <P> In this case, because the procedure was not done by a physician, and because the method used could not be considered ethical, two of the above conditions were not met. Because the victim acted on his own free will, however, the court ruled this a case of "Requested Murder"  and sentenced the defendent to a one year prison term and three years probation. This case formed the current background in Japan for the wishes of medical patients to die1,2.     <P>The most recent case in Japan of a hospital-based killing took place in 1991 at the Tokai University Medical Center in Kanagawa2,3,4. After a terminally ill 58-year-old man with multiple myeloma, renal failure, severe pain and convulsions became unconscious, the doctor removed the IV lines at the family's request, and then gave the patient a lethal injection of potassium chloride.  Although the doctor testified that the patient's family had urged him to perform euthanasia to ease the patient's suffering, the police investigation reported that the family had not meant for the patient to be killed when they requested intervention to ease his suffering.      <P>In 1995, in a ruling that supported the self-determination of a terminally ill patient, the court decided that because the euthanasia was not the expressed wish of the patient, the act of euthanasia was not lawful. The doctor was sentenced to two years in prison, but the sentence was suspended for two years because of the family's suspected pressure to end the patient's suffering and the lack of a system to manage the terminally ill. The court also stated that a patient could request to have treatment stopped and that a family can make inferences about a patient's will if the patient is comatose.    <P> While the majority of public responses reported in the media expressed admiration and respect for the physician's actions, some have pointed out how this case illuminates the tendency in Japanese society for families to make serious medical decisions on behalf of a sick family member sometimes even without discusssion with the patient, without informing the patient of their diagnosis, and even overriding the patient's own decisions2,5. One Japanese neurologist wrote, "...we should reconsider our current policy of everyone from the patients' friends to their boss feeling they have the right to inquire about a patient's condition "6.   <P>   These issues may come more to the fore since the Japan  Science Council approved a report in 1994 advocating voluntary euthanasia for patients in a deep, irreversible coma, provided the patient has previously stated opposition to life-prolonging measures4,7.  Because suicide is culturally more acceptable in Japan than in western countries8 (Japanese society usually feels sympathy for a  mother who commits "oyako shinju", murder-suicide of herself and her children9), there is the concern that a loose interpretation of the law might put too much decision making power into the hands of physicians. There are also concerns that if 'dignified death' is overvalued in Japan, rescue efforts that can save some patients may be overlooked6.  In addition to the problems of an aging society that are now becoming more acute in Japan7,10, these legal changes might lead to a situation where what should be an individual question could be extended to a kind of "social euthanasia". In 1993, while those 65 and over accounted for 13% of the total Japanese population, this group made up 26% of all suicides, and is expected to comprise 24% of the total population by the Year 202010. Intervention for Japanese elderly suicidal patients may be particularly difficult because of the strong sense of shame about seeking help from a mental health professional, and primary care physicians often do not correctly diagnose a mental disorder10.          <P>Consultation/Liaison (C/L) psychiatry in Japan is not a well established subspecialty as it is in other countries like the United States and psychiatric problems encountered on medical units are often handled by the primary physician, with little experience in this area11.  The population of Japan is about 120,000,000 and there are about 10,000 psychiatrists. About 50% of general hospitals have departments of psychiatry which provide some consultation service, however there are very few full-time C/L psychiatrists largely because this service is not reimbursed by the National Heatlth Insurance (11, Personal communication-Japanese General Hospital Psychiatry Association).       <P>While medically ill patients' refusal of lifesaving treatment is more and more viewed as "allowing to die", in psychiatric settings, a patient's desire to die is generally considered evidence of a mental disorder and disturbed decision making capacity12. Studies of suicide victims in both the west and in Japan have consistently found high rates of pre-existing mental disorders13,14. While court rulings in the West that have legitimized patients' decisions to limit treatment have labeled these refusals not as suicide but as  allowing the patient to die naturally, there is a minority of the public who construe this as suicide or killing. If suicide is a behavior that intentionally leads to death,  some treatment refusals may represent suicide15.  Recent studies support the view that suicidal ideas among the terminally ill are linked to  psychiatric disorder,  and psychiatrists will need to determine when depression in the terminally ill may affect one's decision to forgo life-sustaining medical treatment16-18.    <P> The burden of proof the desire to die psychiatry is on the patient who desires to die; in internal medicine, the burden is to prove that the patient lacks competence to refuse life-sustaining treatment on the physician who wishes to override the refusal. Because psychiatrists are in the pivot seat on these decisions in the clinical setting, it is imperitive to clarify their attitudes on this. With this as a backdrop, psychiatrists consulting in general hospitals in Japan will likely be called on more and more to evaluate patients' their family's requests for euthanasia, assisted suicide, suicidal ideation and treatment refusal.       <P>Education and professional guidlines on these issues for psychiatrists in Japan are lacking6, and Japanese psychiatrists attitudes on these issues have not been studied. Issues of whether patients in general medical hospitals who have a desire to die should be allowed to or assisted in this regard, and whether they require psychiatric evaluation and intervention are important areas for Japanese psychiatrists to take the lead in guiding their medical colleagues. The present study was an attempt to begin to systematically investigate these issues. <P>METHODS   <P>  The investigators initially planned a direct study of medical patients'  suicidal ideation in the general hospital, but because questions such as "Do you ever feel like you would rather die?" were seen as being too direct for Japanese patients, this approach had to be abandoned. Japanese are in general reluctant to discuss personal matters openly19 and this may necessitate changes in research design, ie.-anonymous self-report in place of  interview20,21.           <P>For this study we developed the Suicidal Attitudes Inventory (SAI) data base (Not available on-line). The questions were designed to tap the issues discussed in the introduction and were based on prior surveys and literature on these topics12,16,22. The SAI given to the psychiatrists was in Japanese, the English translation in the table was checked by three bilingual psychiatrists (D.B, T.H, and Y.T.). To avoid bias, we did not use the term "euthanasia" in the data base. Anonymity was optional. The instructions to the SAI were as follows:Suicidal Attitudes Inventory (SAI) <P>    This questionnaire is aimed at understanding the attitudes of psychiatrists working in general hospitals toward medical/surgical inpatients who exhibit suicidal ideation or behaviors while in the hospital for a medical/surgical illness. Your answers should be directed towards patients with medical or surgical illnesses who exhibit suicidal ideation or behaviors to staff or family. Do not include those patients brought to or admitted for the medical consequences of a suicidal attempt.  Please circle the choice or fill in the circle that best fits your answer, or fill in the blank where appropriate.<P>     Five data base sets with return-address stamped envelopes were sent to  eighteen psychiatrists working at eighteen different university hospitals chosen from a list of members of the Japanese Society of General Hospital Psychiatry. These psychiatrists were then requested to have up to five members of their departments who do C/L work fill out the questionnaires. These psychiatrists were known by one of the authors (T.H.) to be active in seeing patients on medical services but otherwise there was no knowledge of their attitudes toward medical patients with suicidal ideation, physician assisted suicide or euthanasia.   <P>    Data was analyzed as described in the results section. P values of less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. N's in the results section that do not add up to the total N of 62 respondents indicates no response on that item for the missing subjects. <P>RESULTS  <P>  Fifty-nine data bases were returned from fifteen of the hospitals within a month and on re-mailing after two months one more hospital responded for a total of sixty-two data bases (56 male and 6 female, average age of 36.3+9 years, age range 25 to 55 years. The mean number of years of exprience of the psychiatrists was 10.2+6.52 years (range 1 to 29 years). Number of years of experience was found to correlate with age (r=.92, t=18.3, p=.0001). Demographic variables were otherwise not examined in this study, nor was breakdown by sex or hospital due to the small number of respondents from each hospital and the low ratio (10.7%) of female psychiatrists.   <P> The remaining three hospitals had still not responded after six months.  It was decided not to contact these hospitals in order to inquire as to why they did not respond as in the Japanese context of relationships this might put unnecessary pressure on them and they would not likely answer directly if there was a sensitive reason to not responding.      <P>    Comparison testing among the questions on the SAI was carried out in order to study those factors that had significant relationships. Unpaired student t-test (two-tailed) used for two-group comparisons, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing used for three-group or more testing revealed the following significant relationships.    <P> Question 2: Those subjects who agreed that there may be times when commiting suicide is logical or reasonable had significantly greater degrees of agreement on items a,b,c, and d on question 3 (that commiting suicide is logical or reasonable in terminal patients with or without major depression regardless of quality of life) compared with subjects who responded "no"; association with 3a, p=.003, 3b, p=.002; 3c, p=.02; 3d, p=.02.  Subjects who responded "yes" on question 2 also had a significantly greater degree of agreement on item a on question 4 item a (physician assisted suicide is logical or reasonable in terminal illness with poor quality of life and no major depression, p=.02).      <P> Question 5: Subjects responding that termination of life support in an incurable non-terminal patient with poor quality of life who requests termination is a "suicide" had significantly greater degrees of agreement on question 3 item g (that commiting suicide is logical or reasonable in cases where a non-terminal patient cannot fulfill family duties) compared with those who labeled termination of life support as a "killing" or "letting the patient die naturally". (ANOVA P=.03). Post hoc t-testing revealed that on item g, the "suicide" group, m (mean analog response)=0.8+1.2, was significantly different from the "Killing" group  m=0.2+.4 (Fisher PLSD=.52, p=.02); and from the "letting the patient die naturally" group m=0.2+.4 (Fisher PLSD=.47, p=.008).       <P>     Also on question 5, subjects responding that termination of life support in an incurable non-terminal patient who requests termination is a "suicide" had significantly greater number of years experience as a psychiatrist (20+4.8) compared with those who labeled termination of life support as a "killing" (11.7+5.1, Fisher PLSD=5.4, p=0.003), or those labeling this as "letting the patient die naturally" (8.1+5.7, Fisher PLSD=4.9, p=0.0001). Years of experience was also significantly different between the "killing" and "letting the patient die naturally" groups (Fisher PLSD= 3.5, p=0.04). Three-group ANOVA testing: P=.0001. This was also true for age with the "suicide" group's average age of 46.2+5.0 significantly different from the "killing" group (avg. age=36.9+5.0, Fisher PLSD 6.0, t=3.1, p=.003) and "letting the patient die naturally" group (avg. age= 34.3+6.6 years, Fisher PLSD=5.4, t=4.4, p=.0001) groups. Three-group ANOVA testing: P=.0006.      <P>  Question 8: Subjects responding that it is "sometimes" important to give optimal medical and psychiatric treatment before acceding to a medical patients wish to refuse life saving treatment had significantly greater degrees of agreement on question 4 items f,g,h,i (situations related to failure in duty to others where physician assisted suicide is logical or reasonable)  than those subjects who responded "usually"  or "always"  on this item. After three-group ANOVA testing, P=.03, post hoc t-testing revealed  that for items f,g,h,i the "sometimes" group, m (mean analog response on table 1)=0.4+0.9, was significantly different from the "usually" group  m=0.0 (Fisher PLSD=.3, p=.01); and also from the "always" group m=0.06+.2 (Fisher PLSD=.29, p=.19) (exact same statistics for f,g,h,i items).        <P> Question 11: Subjects responding that medical patients wishes to die are "rarely" rooted in psychopathology had significantly greater degrees of agreement on question 4 item e (that physician assisted suicide is logical or reasonable  in cases where a non-terminal patient is a burden on family for care) than those subjects who responded "sometimes"  or "usually" on this item. After three-group ANOVA testing, p=.047, post hoc t-testing revealed that for item e, the "rarely" group, m (mean analog response on table 1)=0.7+1.2, was significantly different from the "sometimes" group  m=.06+.2 (Fisher PLSD=.48, p=.01; and from the "usually" group m=0.1+.4 (Fisher PLSD=.49, p=.03).         <P> Also on question 11, subjects responding that medical patients wishes to die are "rarely" or "sometimes" rooted in psychopathology had a significantly lower number of years of experience (8.7+5.8) than those subjects who responded "usually" on this item (12.8+6.8), t=2.54, p=.014. <P>DISCUSSION<HR><LI><A HREF="SAI2.html"> (CONTINUED ON FOLLOWING PAGE)</A><HR>

Fifty Japanese female bulimic outpatients filled out a 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire, the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule, the Bulimic Inventory Test, and a clinical database questionnaire. <p>Among 50 bulimic patients, 16 reported a history of physical abuse, and 20 a  history of sexual abuse.  The nature of the sexual abuse reported was relatively mild compared to western reports.  Although the age of onset of dieting, anorexia, binge eating, vomiting, and severity of bulimia had no relationship to abuse history, the patients with sexual abuse histories had more absenteeism in junior high school and  reported more sexual activity than those without such histories.  The patients who reported physical abuse histories scored greater on the somatic symptom section of the General Health Questionnaire.<p> The findings of this study suggest that,  while abuse experiences  themselves do not seem to be a cause of bulimia, these experiences may affect the style and level of adaptive functioning in later life,  and  the type of abuse may  influence the nature of future psychological difficulties.  Differences in the severity of child abuse between Japan and western countries requires further study.<p><HR>

For the purposes of this chapter we would like to introduce a few common concepts related to the Japanese concept of the unconscious.  First is that there is an overwhelming and intense desire for the establishment of an identity by belongingness to a group (Berger, 1985; Christopher, 1983; Doi, 1973; Sugiyama-Lebra, 1976; Takahashi, 1992).  A sense of oneness  "ittaikan" is generated unconsciously with the group and there is a social sensitivity to any possible disruptions in the harmony of this relationship.  Ostracism from the group is to be avoided at all costs.  Pressures to conform to a limited pattern of behavior and thought and an expectation for a total commitment to the group accompany this. <P>A consequence of this is that both the pride and shame of an individual are shared by the group and vice-versa.  Shame, conscious and unconscious, is thus quite powerful and is often an important factor in suicide in Japan.  Guilt is involved in relationships of reciprocity where a favor "on" is accompanied by the burden of the duty of reciprocity "giri" which may be very intense and emotionally uncomfortable (this is in contrast to the western sense of guilt that stems from an internal sense that one has done something wrong).  This sense of a never ending "owing" is quite pervasive in the unconscious of the Japanese especially in relation to those who have taken care of oneself.<P>Suicidal Japanese have similar "risk factors" for suicide to those in other countries.  These risk factors include psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, prior suicide attempts, lack of social support systems, male gender, older age, various kinds of loss, family history of suicide, accident proneness, etc. (Takahashi, 1992, 1993a, 1993b).  Reports on suicide in Japan in English language often overemphasize the cultural difference.<P>This paper will discuss some of the culturally-related dynamics and unconscious processes related suicide in Japan.  After a review of the demographics of suicide in Japan, we will present two exemplary kinds of suicide peculiar to Japanese context, "shinju" and "inseki jisatsu."<P>DEMOGRAPHICS<P>After World War II, there was a peak in the number and the rate of suicide in Japan in the 1950s, followed by a decline, then a second peak in mid-1980s (National Police Agency, 1993; Takahashi, 1993a).  In 1986 there were 25,524 suicides in Japan, which was the highest number of suicides in any year since the war.  However, since 1987 both the number and the rate of suicides gradually decreased despite various socio-economic problems such as changes in social values, family structure, increase in crime and substance abuse, severe competition in society, and a widening gap between the rich and the poor.  All of these factors have been reported by suicidologists to be associated with an increasing suicide rate.<P>In 1992 the declining tendency waned and there were 22,104 suicides, an increase of 4.8 percent.  Economic recession might be an explanation for this increase, but interpretation should be postponed for several more years.In summary, there have been about 21,000 to 22,000 suicides in Japan annually in recent years, which represents a suicide rate of 17 to 18 per 100,000 per year.  Although this number is about twice as many as that of those killed by traffic accidents, attention to suicide prevention in Japan has unfortunately not been adequate.<P>As for the variation in suicide rates by age, in the 1950s and 1960s the suicide rate showed two peaks, one in young adults and one in the elderly.  At that time, Japan had one of the highest suicide rates in the world.  For the past three decades, the suicide rate in young people has been decreasing.  The suicide rate in the elderly has also decreased, but this decrease has not been very large.  Japanese still exhibit higher suicide rates with aging.  In 1992, while those over 65 years old accounted for 13 percent of the population, suicides in this age group represented 27 percent of all suicides.  While suicide is an especially serious problem for the elderly, it has been mostly ignored by Japanese society (Takahashi, Hirasawa, Koyama, Asakawa, Kido, Onose, Udagawa, Ishikawa, & Uno, in press).  <P>Although it has been suggested that attitudes toward suicide vary between cultures, there have been few comparative studies between Japan and other cultures.  Domino and Takahashi (1991) studied medical students' attitudes toward suicide in Japan and the United States using Suicide Opinion Questionnaire and the findings indicated that the Japanese students were more likely to think that suicide is not always an abnormal behavior and it might be permissible in certain situations.  In contrast, the American students were more likely to think that suicide is usually a result of some psychiatric problem with aggression expressed toward oneself, and that suicide should be prevented.  Because the sample size was limited, in this study the findings should not be overgeneralized.  The study is meaningful, however, because it utilized the same data base in both countries.  The results suggest that, in a culture where suicide may be permissible, social factors may need to be taken into consideration.  Attitudes toward suicide may differ in these cultures even if the suicide takes place while the person is in a normal mental state. <P>SHINJU<P>The word shinju in Japanese, originally meant a mutual suicide agreement by lovers in order to prove the genuineness of their love to each other.  According to the strict and original definition described by Ohara (1985), shinju is an act where more than two people commit suicide voluntarily at the same place, at the same time, and for the same purpose.  The definition has become looser and now also includes murder-suicides where some of those involved are killed against their will (Fukushima, 1984).  The definition of shinju now includes both a genuine suicide pact, extended suicide (assisted suicide followed by suicide), and murder-suicide in which the killer and the victim(s) have a strong emotional tie with each other before the act.  The feeling of "oneness" of those involved in shinju is important.<P>Shinju literally means "heart-inside" or "oneness of hearts" (Walsh, 1969) and this probably reflects a psychological joining of the participants. The participants may likely have a conscious awareness of wanting to join or unite with their partner in the afterlife, but unconsciously there may be a wish for infantile symbiosis and an intolerance of separation anxiety.  The development of clear ego boundaries is probably impaired in these individuals though state-related regressions  may also be at play in some individuals.  Uniting with their suicide partner may be a reaction for failure to fit into society or a group.<P>The Japanese language has diverse words for shinju.  Shinju has been classified into two major categories, johshi (mutually consented lovers' suicide) and oyako-shinju (parent-child suicide), the latter of which is subclassified further such as boshi-shinju (mother-child suicide), fushi-shinju (father-child suicide), and ikka-shinju (family suicide).  The number of johshi have been declining in the past three decades.  Although the number of oyako-shinju has been declining since the 1950s as well, it is still a serious problem.<P>Most cases of shinju are boshi-shinju in which the children, who are too young to decide on suicide themselves, are killed by their mothers.  Ohara and Inamura have both pointed out that boshi-shinju and fushi-shinju have important differences (Ohara, 1963, 1965; Inamura, 1977, 1993).  In boshi-shinju mothers in their 20s and 30s kill their children and then commit suicide.  The children most often victimized in boshi-shinju are of preschool age.  In fushi-shinju the fathers (who are usually older than the boshi-shinju mothers) kill their children (who are older than the victims of boshi-shinju), and then commit suicide.  The most common reasons for boshi-shinju are psychiatric disorders and family conflicts, while those of fushi-shinju are financial problems and physical illness.  Japanese often show considerable sympathy toward parents who are not able to find any other recourse but to commit suicide with her/his children.<P>Japanese society as a whole fosters a mutual interdependency in the socialization process and this is quite a contrast to the emphasis placed in individuality put in the west (Christopher, 1983).  In order to promote this mutual dependency there is probably some unconscious muting of the separation-individuation process on the part of caregivers as described by Margaret Mahler (1972).As a consequence, the boundaries, both conscious and unconscious, in ones nuclear family can be more blurred than in western society and this may have lead to the development of shinju as a Japanese cultural phenomena.  Post partum depression may also be an important factor in boshi-shinju.<P>Marzuk, Tardiff, and Hirsch (1992) have recently reviewed research on murder-suicide, but the term "murder-suicide" used by Marzuk et al. has some important differences from "shinju".  Thus, it should be kept in mind that "murder-suicide" and "shinju" are not quite the same, an indication that suicide is often interpreted differently in different cultures and will be discussed below.<P>Marzuk et al. reviewed the studies on suicide published in the United States over the past 30 years and found that the incidence of murder-suicide was 0.2 to 0.3 per 100,000 per 100,000.  The overall suicide rate, which has been fairly stable over this period in the United States, was about 12.  They estimated, therefore, that the portion of murder-suicide among all suicide was about 1.7 to 2.5 percent.  They also reviewed 17 papers published from 1900 to 1979 in various countries in North America and Europe and found that the rates of murder-suicide in those countries were similar, 0.2 to 0.3.  While the reason for this similarity is not clear, Marzuk et al. pointed out that, although the incidence of murder-suicide is similar, the type of murder-suicide may differ from country to country.  For example, in the United States one-half to three-quarters of murder-suicides are those in which a husband murders his wife and then kills himself.  In Britain and Japan, most murder-suicides are those in which a mother kills her children and then commits suicide.<P>Inamura (1993) reported that shinju has accounted for 1.6 percent of all recent suicides.  Based on this figure, the rate of shinju among all suicides is estimated to be 0.29, which is similar to that reported by Marzuk et al.  In Japan, the type of shinju has been changing; in 1950s johshi was the most prevalent, but since the 1960s the number of boshi-shinju has become the most common.<P>While the incidence of murder-suicide is not all that different in different cultures, each society deals with it differently, as Marzuk et al. have noted.  Aizawa (1975) also pointed out in his paper on shinju that "The important thing in studying the relationship between shinju and Japanese culture is not to focus only on statistical analysis and literature on shinju in Japan and other cultures, but to concentrate on the sympathy Japanese have toward shinju." (p. 143)  Similar cases may be interpreted differently in different cultures.  Most Western cultures would consider this to be a murder-suicide, and not a parent-child suicide, because the children usually do not commit suicide on their own free will but are killed by their parents.  The Santa Monica (California) case was a typical example of this kind of suicide (Japan Times, 1985).  On January 29, 1985, a 32-year-old Japanese immigrant woman tried to drown herself, her infant daughter and her four-year-old son by entering the ocean on Santa Monica Beach.  Although they were quickly pulled out from the water, only the mother survived.  She was tried in a California court for child abuse and first-degree murder.  When this was reported in Japan, it shocked Japanese society.  There was also the added feature for the Japanese of being subjected to foreign censure in this case, something not easily accepted.<P>This mother had attempted oyako-shinju about a week after discovering that her husband had been having a secret extramarital affair for years, leaving her depressed and ruminating about suicide.  The reasons for her despair were personal, and although maladaptive, the method she chose to resolve it was cultural, and very Japanese.Although she had lived in the United States for 14 years, she remained Japanese in her thinking and life style, isolated from American culture.  She did not drive, spoke little English, knew nothing of her husband's business, and had no hobbies or close friends outside the family.  In other words, she was virtually without any kind of support system which might have sustained her in time of emotional distress.  Social supports have also been found to be important for preventing suicide in Western society (Berger, 1993).<P>In Japan, the mother-child bond and the mother's dedication to the child are very important.  Why then, is infanticide committed by the mother relatively common in Japan?  Paradoxically, it is this very bond between mother and child that causes oyako-shinju.  According to Japanese logic, the suicidal mother cannot bear to leave the child to survive alone; she would rather kill the child because she believes that nobody else in the world would take care of the child better than she, and that the child would be better off dying with her.  <P>At this point we should introduce the concept of amae which was popularized by Takeo Doi a well-known Japanese psychiatrist (Berger, et. al., 1994; Doi, 1973).  Amae may be described as a mutual dependency where the assurance of another's good will permits a certain degree of self-indulgence.  Much of this process is unconscious and partly explains the insularity of Japanese society because foreigners cannot readily fit into this mutual good will interaction.<P>A western concept that Doi felt was equivalent to amae is that of "passive object love" described by Michael Balint (1965).  The importance of amae is that it is a harmonious state of affairs where one can be relieved of the  burden of "on" and "giri".  When the unconscious expectations of amae fall apart, or if for example the mother feels she cannot provide for an amae relationship for her children in the face of severe family conflict, this may be a risk factor for shinju. Shame and severance of ones connection to the group (family) are important factors as discussed above.<P>This feeling of oneness (which may be delusional in quality) and symbiosis between a mother and her children has intensified as a result of the breakdown of the traditional community in which children belonged to a wider circle where they had fictive as well as substitute parents along with their real parents.  Today, because of the development of the nuclear family, children, particularly those of preschool age, belong to their parents alone.  The mother-child bond may also be reinforced in Japanese society because females do not usually have the emotional and social supports afforded by a career owing to the male-focused orientation in the work place, lack of an outside social support system and a 24-hour focus on the family.When boshi-shinju takes place, sympathy is usually given to the mother who was not able to think about ways other than shinju to solve her problems.  Japanese society in general rarely accuses the mother of infanticide.<P>In Japan, or in other Asian countries where Confucianism is prevalent, conscious and unconscious, symbiotic ties between oneself and significant others are very common and these kinds of relationships may be valued highly (Takahashi, 1989).  In this situation, murdering one's children can be unconsciously regarded as murdering a part of oneself.  The mother may not necessarily realize that she is killing another human being separate from herself, but unconsciously rather feels as though she is killing a part of herself.  In the psychology of the mother who commits boshi-shinju, killing her own children is equivalent to actually killing herself, and this is interpreted as a kind of "extended suicide".  It is impossible for her to imagine a world for her children after her death. Japanese society is often sympathetic to this dynamic.  In addition, Japanese have a general reluctance to criticize each other which may be related to a filial piety to the group.  However, we should also note the proverb "Shinu kiga areba nandemo dekiru" which means "If one has a will to die, one could do anything."  The existence of this proverb probably reflects Japanese society's ambivalence to shinju, both praising and demanding suicide in the same proverb.<P>Some boshi-shinju may be a way for a wife to get revenge on her husband.  She may react to the discover of her husband having an extramarital affair or demand for divorce by killing her children in order to punish her husband after she commits suicide.  In most of cases of boshi-shinju, however, there is a strong tendency for the mother to consider the children as an essential part of herself.  In Japan, this tendency is observed even among parents with much older children.  It is believed that children cannot or should not be left alone in the world where parent(s) have killed themselves.  The children are killed before the parent commits suicide, because they are loved deeply.  It may also be that because they are considered a part of the parent, she/he should take care of them by themselves.  An alternative interpretation could be that pathological separation-individuation (in the Western sense), or an overly symbiotic oneness (in the Eastern sense) could have caused blurring of unconscious ego boundaries.<P>Western society, in contrast, would usually consider a child, even an infant, as having a separate existence from the parent.  The concept of oyako-shinju would not easily take root in this cultural context.  In Western society it would be felt that the suicidal mother chooses to kill her children for selfish motives.  The converse is true in Japan where the concept of children separate from their parents has not taken root.  (Though there is intervention by social agencies, children are rarely taken from their parents in abusive situations).  In the Western cultural context the mother is usually held responsible, and may be tried for murder.  In Japan there would also be a court case, though the sentencing would likely be lighter and more sympathy given to the mother.<P>Though there are different unconscious dynamics involved here from those of Western psychology it should be emphasized that the adults involved in shinju do not represent the norm of Japanese society.  These are usually individuals who become desperate due to a combination of a life stressor, concomitant psychiatric illness such as depression or psychosis, and premorbid personality vulnerabilities (possibly personality disorder) which then interact with certain cultural tendencies.  The average psychologically healthy Japanese would not consider shinju as a solution to their problems (The vast majority of Japanese who experience the family stressors thought to be associated with shinju do not engage in this behavior).<P>As clinicians practicing in Japan, we have to weigh the risk of shinju carefully when we evaluate patients who may be at risk.  If the patient has a poor social support system, therapists have to mobilize available resources and solicit as much support from relatives as possible in order to prevent shinju. <P>INSEKI-JISATSU<P>Throughout the history of Japan, there has been almost no period when suicide was prohibited by law.  The exception was in the early 18th century when a cluster of joshi  suicides (lovers' suicide pact) was triggered by melodramas written by Chikamatsu Monzaemon.  The government prohibited johshi in order to prevent these suicides.  If a joshi occurred, a funeral was prohibited, and the bodies were left in the public view at Nihonbashi Bridge for three days.  If one died and the other survived, the survivor was convicted of murder.<P>The most widely known form of suicide outside of Japan is harakiri, or seppuku, which means suicide by stabbing one's abdomen.  Harakiri was the ritual form of suicide practiced by feudal warriors to show that they accepted responsibility for their actions (Fus, 1985), and had its beginnings about 1,000 years ago.  Japanese warriors used to respect the abdomen because it was considered to be the seat of the soul, so when they assumed responsibility for some serious action or course of conduct, they would cut open their abdomen to demonstrate their innocence and bravery.  Cutting one's abdomen itself was not a very effective way to kill oneself so that in the ritual another person severed their neck.<P>Since the late 19th century when the Edo era ended, harakiri has rarely been practiced either as a form of suicide or as a punishment.  The harakiri suicide of the famous Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima in 1970 was an extremely exceptional case, and astonished even the Japanese.<P>While contemporary Japanese do not commit suicide by harakiri, inseki-jisatsu is a form of suicide sometimes regarded as a way of taking responsibility.  Inseki means taking responsibility and jisatsu means suicide in Japanese.  Toyomasa Fuso, a sociologist and suicidologist, has been conducting suicide research from a cross-cultural perspective and suggested that suicide often takes place when political or social scandals occur in Japan.<P>Fuso (1985) noted an interesting difference here between Japan and the United States.@Some of the officials who were found guilty in the Watergate Scandal, when on bail or after release from prison, wrote memoirs, and gave lectures.....Almost no one killed themselves suffering from the crime they committed.  When scandals occur in Japan, persons who hold important information and feel loyal to the key figures who actually control from behind the scenes often commit suicide.  It is rare for the key figures themselves to commit suicide.  (p.208)@The key differences here may relate to the strong bond people have to members of the same group in Japan, reminiscent of the bond to the mother (the other side of the coin is the strong exclusion of those not in the group).<P>The Japanese individual will feel an intense indebtedness to their group, and as noted above their unconscious need to relieve this burden can result in their taking responsibility as a way to prevent ostracism from the group.  This can be seen in everyday life where workers may work late into the night for fear that their coworkers would resent them if they left earlier than the group as a whole.  While superficially it seems that the individual is sacrificing for the group it is actually the unconscious and preconscious needs of the individual to maintain group acceptance that is expressed in manifest self-sacrifice.<P>Ono has stressed how Japanese evaluate themselves in his discussion of the difference between the western concept of social phobia and the Japanese concept of social phobia or "taijin kyoufu" (Ono, 1991).  The western social phobics are concerned about their behavior as assessed by their own standards while the "taijin kyoufu" patients assess this by the standards of others.  This is related to two kinds of shame. In western shame the feeling comes from the discrepancy between the person's own ego ideal and his behavior, resulting in anxiety that this discrepancy will be noticed by others. The Japanese type of shame on the other hand is characterized by the feeling that comes from the concern about how others view their behavior and the fear that as others become aware of their shortcomings they will be excluded from a group of significant others.<P>The mass media in Japan has not recently reported suicide cases in an exaggerated fashion.  This does not hold, however, for cluster suicides in young people or for suicides of those involved in political scandals.  The mass media report such cases repeatedly and sensationally.  While only the facts are briefly reported for ordinary suicides, great details of the behavior before the suicide and the methods of the suicide are often reported for inseki-jisatsu.  They usually do not touch upon the psychiatric problems that might have existed in those killing themselves.  There is also a trend for the suicide to be reported as a way of taking responsibility for some wrong doing.<P>Often, someone who has important information about the facts of the situation commits suicide and leaves a note saying something like "I did nothing wrong.  However, I have caused a great deal of trouble to my organization.  Therefore, for this I will take responsibility by committing suicide."  De Vos (1968) called exaggerated self-identification to a role given by others or an organization to which an individual belongs, "role narcissism."  De Vos pointed out that suicide may take place because unconscious identification to a group (or its leader) is so strong that it becomes almost impossible to imagine dissolution of the group.<P>In Western culture, the high value placed on individuality does not lend itself to the type of suicide resulting from over-identification to a group (such as inseki-jisatsu), consequently, statistics are not available to compare with inseki-jisatsu in Japan.<P>CONCLUSION<P>Suicide is a complex human behavior that includes multiple unconscious processes and needs to be interpreted multidimentionally from a biopsychosocial perspective.  Suicide should not be interpreted on a psychiatric or a cultural perspective alone but by an integrated view of these variables.  We have presented a general overview of those unconscious and cultural factors involved in suicide in contemporary Japan, though by no means the only important aspect involved in any individual suicide.<P>REFERENCES<P>Aizawa, S.

Tokyo Institute of Psychiatry, Tokyo Japan <P> ABSTRACT    <P>@Due to economic pressures and the development of pharmacotherapy,  it is becoming more and more difficult to spend fourty-five or fifty minutes per session.  In order to modify the mental schemas and personality structures that predispose to psychiatric symptomatology to a degree that will prevent relapse and improve well-being, psychotherapeutic approaches are indispensable in our experience.  In Japan, many patients benefit from a brief session cognitive approach of approximately fifteen minutes per session with medication.  The main purpose of this approach is to help patients to modify their distorted cognitions in order to foster a sense of control internally as well as externally, and to improve their communication with important figures.  Several techniques of such brief-session psychotherapy are discussed in this paper: 1)Respecting  the patient's abilities and individuality to help the patient to make most use of them.  2)Modifing cognitive distortions by focusing on the so-called "hard-core" schema of "I'm unlovable" and "I'm helpless".  3)Follow the patient's activity both inside and outside the treatment.  4)Discuss long-term goals, and promote acceptance of their limitations.  Application of the above technique with Japanese patients using the concepts of Zen Buddism and the Japanese Tea ceremony as a background base, and their relation with modern western cognitive and dynamic therapy theory, is also discussed.<P>INTRODUCTION<P>@   Psychotherapy appears to have become less important recently due to the advent of more effctive psychotropic medication with fewer side effects and increasing evidence of neurophysiological and genetic factors in mental disorders.  Especially in the United States, this trend has been facilitated by economic pressures causing psychiatrists to cut the time spent with each patient.<P>@   These facts, however, do not mean that psychotherapy is actually unnecessary.  If the DSM-III-R (1987) Axis I state disorders become more treatable with pharmachotherapy, then the Axis II personality disorders or traits will become the main target for psychotherapeutic approaches which can be effective in a limited time frame.<P>@   One model for this kind of approach is found in Japan where interview time has been restricted due to the public insurance system.  Japanese psychiatrists who can spend only ten to fifteen minutes per session have tried to develop techniques to understand and help patients in brief sessions.  This paper will describe the techniques which one of the authors (Ono) has developed in this regard.   <P>  The basic principle of these techniques are based mainly on Beck's cognitive theory (1976) and dynamic psychotherapy.  Beck (personal communication) stresses the importance of two schema, "I am unlovable" and "I am helpless", in the pathology of personality disorder patients and calls them "hard-core schema".  The authors think that these two schema are important to understand and treat not only in personality disorders but also in other psychiatric disorders. <P>     Beck's "hard-core schema" concept overlaps considerably with the "triple C concept" (cognition/control/communication) which the authors have used in creating psychologic change and in the amelioration of symptoms. With the help of the clinician, patients try to change their distorted cognitions into more rational and adaptive ones which helps them regain a sense of control internally as well as externally.  This change can improve their communication with important figures which then strengthens social suppots.  Regaining a sense of control leads to modification of the "helpless schema", and improvement of communication leads to modification of the "unlovable schema". <P>    The idea of helping oneself with helplessness through self-empowerment has a long history in Japan in Zen where one's potential strength lies only within oneself, and only by one's efforts can one increase it  (Benedict, 1946). As a fencer must learn to stand easily on a pilliar, a patient must learn to stand on their own emotionally. In Zen, one might associate oneself with a teacher, but the teacher cannot teach in the Occidental sense as only what is internally learned is of any importance. <P>    Statements from the therapist might be akin to the Zen "Koan", or problems given which have no rational solution. For example, "to concieve the clapping of one hand", or "To feel the yearning for one's mother before one's own conception". The koans are felt to be bricks which help one knock on the door to enlightenment about human nature. For Japanese this door is the door of haji (shame), and once one finds a way out of their shame one is free to experience life without bonds. This can be seen as one abandoning on'e "observing self" that for many Japanese patients keeps them bound in obsessions on duty, responsibility and how they are percieved by others. Further discussion of Zen will be presented below. <P>MEDICAL INSURANCE SYSTEM IN JAPAN<P>@   Almost all medical fees in Japan are covered by the public health insurance system with patients having a ten to thirty percent co-payment.  If the fee becomes high (over appoximately nine hundred dollers in total), or if the patient is indigent, the fee is subsidized.  Psychiatric patients are also supported by a special law which provides subsidies for psychiatric treatment if a patient applies.  Although everyone has to pay for this heath system, the payment is affordable for everyone because it is based on a sliding scale depending on income.<P>     In this health insurance system, however, the importance of psychological approaches such as psychotherapy tend to be neglected compared to that of more medically oriented procedures.  For example, the fee for psychotheapy by a psychiatrist is 2800 yen (27 dollars) at a hospital and 3300 yen (31 dollars) at a small outpatient clinic regardless the length of the interview.  This situation makes it necessary for Japanese psychiatrists to see as many patients as possible during their clinical hours.  This tendency is also related to the the fact that 8000 psychiatrists are working for one hundred and twenty million people in Japan.<P>@   According to a 1987 survay by Nishizono (1988) the avarage number of outpatients per day at 252 facilities was about 50 including 1.7 new visits.  These patients are seen by only one psychiatrist in most of these settings with an average interview length of less than fifteen minutes.  According to a study by Fujita, Koga, Takeuchi, and Takemasa (1993) in which anxiety disorder vignettes were given to psychiatrists, more than 90 percent of the respondents answered that they would spend less than 30 minutes with each patient.<P>NON SPECIFIC FACTORS<P>Clinician's Attitude<P>@   In order to treat a patient effectively in a brief session, nonspecific factors (Frank, 1979) such as the atomosphere of the treatment setting play an important role.  A clinician's empathic attitude and nonverbal communications are important in this regard.  This contribute to the development of a "holding environment" (Winnicott, 1965) which is a nonspecific factor thought to affect the outcome of psychotherapy.  An especially important nonspecific factor in Japan that is felt to connect the patient and the therapist is "silence" which, in Zen Buddism, is considered to be the essence of human existence (Kino, 1966).   <P>  Silence in the therapeutic relationship is colored by the clinician's internal and external attitudes.  Internal attitudes consist of the clinician's way of thinking about the patient's psychological experiences.  External attitudes consists of clinician's facial expressions, postures, intonation of voice, timing of verval and nonverval expressions, and other various factors.  These attitudes contribute to an affect attunement in the therapeutic dyad which is similar to the relationship between a mother and an infant as described by Stern (1985).  This therapeutic relationship helps to produce a corrective emotional experience (Alexander, 1966), helps a patient reconfirm their existence, and modifies both the "unlovable" and the "helpless" schema. <P>Therapist's Internal Attitudes<P>     One of the most important internal attitudes of the therapist can be explained by the concept "Ichigoiche" of the Japanese tea cermony.  Ichigo means a "whole life" and Ichie means one meeting.  Naosuke Ii (1815-1860), a famous politician who tried to open Japan after two hundred years of isolation, quoted the term, "Ichigoichie", to describe the psychological attitude of the tea ceremoy host (Kino, 1966).  The host should think that this is the only opportunity they will ever have to see the guest.  With this in mind the host is able to treat the guest with feeling, enabling meaningful psychological interaction.  The guest, in turn, also feels the thoughtfullness of the host and is able to leave the room with satisfaction.  This kind of experience makes it possible to internalize a good object image, and both the host and the guest are able to "see" each other internally at any time in the future.  <P>@   This attitude of the host can also be applied to psychotherapy.  The clinician should conduct an interview by keeping the Ichigoichie feeling in mind.  This means that the clinician should try to help the patient feel that they have gotten something important out of the session.  For example, a meaningful experience for the patient could be to just spend time with the clinician if they had not been able to associate with other people for a long time despite a desire to do so.  Patient whose problems developed secondary to cognitive distortions would need to begin cogntive restructuring techniques.<P>@   Focusing on the patient's needs allows the patient to leave the room with the satisfaction that a tea ceremony guest does even if the length of the session is brief.  This kind of experience helps patients to internalize the clinician's good object image as well as a good self image with its accompanying warm affect; this modifies the "unlovable" schema.  Furthermore the patient can also internalize the strategies and attitudes the clinician has used in the treatment.  These internalizations cultivate the patient's ability to cope with difficulties outside of the sessions, which can then modify the "helpless" schema. @<P>   In order to strengthen these experiences the "Zanshin" concept of the tea ceremony is also useful.  ZAN means remain and SHIN means mind.  Zanshin is the word used to express the psychological attitude at the time when a host sees a guest out.  The host should not just start cleaning-up after the meeting.  They are expected to stay, quietly reexperiencing the excitement of the meeting which still remains in the room.  These psychological attitudes are also important for a clinician.  The clinician should silently spend at least several seconds reflecting on the meeting with a patient before beginning the next work.  This attitude will be sensed by patients.<P>Respect the Patient's Ability  <P>   The clinician's attitude is basically to acknowledge that the patient has a leading part in the treatment and to respect their position in this regard.  This is a basic principle of cognitive therapy.  In cognitive therapy patients' distorted cgnitions need to be identified by the patients own cognitions.     In order to make the most of the patient's capability in treatment, a clinician can utilize Socratic questions. The clinician should avoid giving an interpretation regarding the patient's unconscious fantasies. When a patient complains of distress and psychological pain, it should be taken at face value.<P>Patient-Therapist Match@ <P>  In order to make the most of nonspecific factors, therapists and patients need to be congenial to each other. Okonogi (1987) suggested that the drop-out rate in the psychotherapy of borderline patients is low when the clinician-patient combination is well matched, and that this is important for referring psychiatrists to keep in mind.@<P>   In the Japanese system in which the medical fee is low, patients can easily choose a clinician because they can decide after a few trial visits.  The advantage of this is that patient can independently find a clinician they match with.  On ther other hand, these patients might end up in a "revolving door syndrome".  In order to avoid this problem the clinician should ask about treatment history, especially about prior patient-therapist relationships at the initial session.  This information is important in predicting future therapeutic relationships.  If necessary, the clinician should recommend the patient to go back to their former clinician.@ <P>  The experience of behaving independently in the therapy allows patients to practice coping strategies and problem solving by themselves.  The patient also feels that they have achieved or aquired something in the session.  This enhances the patient's self-efficacy, strengthens their motivation for the treatment, and finally modify the "helpless" schema.  Usually patients have been neglected by important others. The experience that their thoughts and feelings are respected induces a corrective emotional experience and modifies the "unlovable" schema. <P>Preventing Patients' Regression    <P> Respecting the patient's decisions in a collaborative way may prevent further regression.  Most patients when first seen are already regressed.  If the patient is allowed to regress further, there is the danger of experiencing a "malignant" regression as described by Balint (1968).  This can lead to various types of iatrogenic borderline-like behaviors.  Preventing regression can strengthen both the "helpless" and "unlovable" schema.  Shortening session time can also help to prevent unnecessary regressions.<P>SPECIFIC FACTORS <P>Treatment Process<P>   @The principles of cognitive therapy can be applied to the usual treatment process.  This consists of four stages which can be conceptualized based on the "KiShoTenKetsu" (introduction, development, turn, and conclusion) process.  The description of "KiShoTenKetsu" originates from classic Chinese writing style and is also used as a model for the Japanese writing style.  Although the actual treatment process usually can not be clearly classified into four stages, this conceptualization is useful for clinicians to estimate where they are in the treatment.    <P>  In the first stage, the clinician and patient collaboratively and concretely assess the patient's realistic life problems and their psychological problems.  Based on the asessment, psychological and biological treatment approaches are proposed, clarifying the similarities with, and differences from the patient's expectations. <P>    At the second stage, cognitive approaches are applied to focus on, and modify distortions of automatic thoughts, and review the the daily schedule.  In order to utilize these cognitive approaches effectively in a brief session the focus is put on the automatic thoughts derived from the "helplessness" and "unlovable" schema.  At the third stage, the "hard-core" schema themselves should be identified and modified based on the themes that repeatedly appear in the automatic thoughts.  In the fouth stage the patient is helped to prepare to seperate from the clinician, and to start moving in to the real world on their own.<P>Basic Model for the Treatment <P>    As Beck (1976) has pointed out, clinicians need to have their own basic blueprints for understanding and treating psychopathology.  Figure 1 shows the basic model for treatment  (Ono, 1993).  An individual responds in different ways to internal and external stimuli.  These could be interpersonal conflicts, realistic burdens, physical conditions, and internal experiences such as fantasy and memory.  @ <P>  These stimuli induce reactions in thought, mood, behavior, and body.  These reactions themselves can then become stimuli.  These stimuli and reactions are mediated by cognitions which are determined by the underlying schema. The formation of the schema is influenced by both genetic and environment factors.    <P> Recently, the treatment of personality disorder patients has led cognitive therapists to pay more and more attention to the underlying schema  (Beck, Freeman, et al., 1990).  As mentioned before, Beck stresses the importance of "hard-core" schemas as "I am unlovable" and "I am helpless" in the treatment of personality disorder patients.  It is also useful to utilize the "hard-core" schema to identify and modify distorted cognitions, and to heighten a sense of control and communication in other disorders as well.<P>Initial Interview <P>    Although the interview time per patient is limitted the clinician should try to spend between 30 and 60 minutes at the initial interview.  In this session the clinician and the patient collaboratively try to assess the problems based on the model described above.  First, the realistic problems are asessed.  Are there any problems in the family and/or work?  How much are they supported in these situations?  What is his/her fiancial condition?  How much have they achieved in the tasks related to their developmental stage in life?  @<P>   Then, a screening physical exam is done and a mental status is taken.  The clinician should assess the patient's assets and strengths as well as the problems. Throughout the therapy the clinician repeatedly conducts this kind of assessment and identifies which areas have improved and which have deteriorated.     <P> During this assessment the clinician tries to find the relationship between the manifest problems and the underlying hard-core schema.  Inquiring about the characteristics of the patient's personality as described by the patient is also useful to get to the underlying schema.  The descrepancies between the clinician's impressions and the patient's descriptions are important because they may reflect the patient's cognitive distortions.  The results of the assessment are discussed with the patient, and this is important in order to promote the patient becoming able to conduct a similar assessment on their own.  The amount of information to be given to the patient is determined on the context of the treatment.@ <P>  Through this assessment, the clinician and the patient can deliniate the concrete problems and decide their hierarchy.  This process enables  the treatment to focus on more important and treatable issues and shorten the session.  The patient and their significant others are encouraged to describe the characteristics of the patient's personality.  They use both dimensional and categorial descriptions.  These descriptions are useful because they usually reflect the patient's self image and interpersonal relationships.   <P>  The other important issue in the initial interview is to discuss the long term goals in the patient's life.  If this can be made clear, it strengthens the patient's motivation.   This kind of communication also conveys that the main purpose of treatment is to increase psychological well-being as well as to reduce symptoms.    <P> If the clinician and patient can not make long-term goals clear they should at least try to image a certain picture of the patient's future.  This picture might then become clearer as both participants achieve the short term goals.  <P>   Some patients may feel frustrated from the start of the treatment.  If the patient has strong expectation to be cured they will soon realize that the clinician is not powerful enough, and they can become easily disappointed.  If that is the case, the clinician can point out that the patient tends to have unrealistic expectations and that this tendency might have caused other interpersonal problems.     <P>  Because of cultural factors, however, Japanese patients rarely express these intense negative feelings outwardly and instead tend to keep them supressed.  It is therefore important for Japanese clinicians to look for discrepancies between what the patient says and their behavior, attitudes, and facial expressions as information about hidden feelings.  The more severe the personality disturbance (ie.--borderline structure), the more obvious these discrepancies will become.<P>Psychoeducation@ <P>  After the initial assessment the clinician tries to share the imformation with the patient in an educational way.  Patients are usually afraid of the idea that they are suffering from a psychiatric disorder or have psychological problems.  Psychoeducation can reduce this kind of unnecessary fear and help patients to face these problems.         <P>  Booklets which describes disorders in lay terms is useful.  One of us (Ono) recently wrote a book entitled, "Utilizing the Depressive Experience -- Cognitive Therapy for Depression" (1990) which has been well recognized by Japanese patients and patients' relatives as well as specialists.  Some patients that have severe depression, however, had compained that it was difficult to read even an easy book.  In response to this, Ono wrote a comic book (1993) which describes a middle aged man who suffered and recovered from depression by restructuring his cognitions with the help of his family.  Comic books are widely read in Japan and are a good means to provide educational information visually as well as verbally.   <P>  Pharmacotherapy      <P>   Psychoeducation is also necessary for pharmacotherapy.  It has been widely acknowledged that pharmachotherapy and psychotherapy are not contradictory but rather complementary (Manning, Frances, 1990, Hollon, DeRubeis, Evance, 1990).  Pharmachotherapy is expected to ameliorate the symptoms initially, which then makes it possible to focus on psychological or personality issues using psychotherapeutic approaches in shorter sessions.       From the authors' experience in Japan, however, more than half of patients have concerns about medication.  They fear that medication would cause a disasterous change in their body or that they might become dependent on the medicine.  Some of them do not want to take medicine because they do not want to accept the idea that they have difficulties in their mind, or to be controled from outside.     Because cognitive distortions can be identified in patients' reactions, it is useful to discuss concerns related to medication.  At the same time the clinician should ask a patient how much and in what way they want to take medication. <HR><LI><A HREF="ZenPage2.Html"> (CONTINUED ON FOLLOWING PAGE)</A><HR>

</strong>    <P> Department of Psychiatry Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx New York U.S.A.; Visiting Researcher, Tokyo Institute of Psychiatry, Tokyo Japan <P> Key Words: suicide, medical illness, medical patient <P> Abstract:@ <P> This paper reviews the relationship between physical illness and suicide, the studies of attempters and completers of suicide in general hospitals, and those studies that have investigated the characteristics of patients in the medical setting who have suicidal ideation. Study of suicidal ideation in a general hospital setting aimed at characterizing patients' suicidality may allow psychiatrists to better discriminate those patients who are at greater risk for completed suicide. Comparison of medical patients with suicidal ideation to those who had attempted or completed suicide, and recommendations to reduce suicidal impulses and treat  these patients are discussed. <P> INTRODUCTION <P>      Suicidal patients are among the most challenging patients to confront a psychiatrist in the general medical setting. Chronic medical illness and pain have been found to be risk factors for suicide (2,8,11,17). Psychiatrists working in general medical hospitals often get called to evaluate patients for suicidality.  Because of this and because these high-risk patients have not been well studied, we felt that characterizing this group would provide a more empirical foundation for evaluation and treatment recommendations.                     This paper will first give an overview of the relationship of physical illness to suicide, review the studies of attempted and completed suicides in medical patients, and then discuss some recent studies that have attempted to characterize and evaluate patients with suicidal ideation.<P>RELATIONSHIP OF PHYSICAL ILLNESS TO SUICIDE <P>      Mackenzie (14), reviewed several studies on the relationship of suicide in physical illness. A meta-analysis of several studies over the years led Mackenzie to make the following conclusions. First,  physical illness is reported to be involved in between 20%-70% of  suicides, and felt to be important in from 11%-51%. Suicide attempts  are more often lethal when related to physical illness than when not. Suicides related to physical illness are more often in older males leading to the speculation that men are less able to emotionally accept passivity and feelings of helplessness. Depression secondary to pain, changes in physical function and structure, and changes in appearance and socialrelationships are  common themes.       <P> Mackenzie also discussed ways that physical illness could affect suicidal impulsivity. These include, 1.) that of the illness itself causing the initiation or exaccerbation of a mental disorder (ie.-post MI depression), 2.) illness causing organic mental disorder (ie.-command suicidal hallucinations secondary to delirium), or 3.) the patient gives up on the treatment which leads to an effectual suicide. Studies to date suggest that the first cause is the most common. Suicides in patients with physical illness usually have a concomitant mental illness, most commonly depression and alcoholism. The terminally ill who suicide are least likely to have mental disorders. Organic brain syndrome was found in only 10%-20% of suicides in the medicall ill.     <P>  Certain diseases that were found to have higher incidences of suicide include cancer, head injury, Huntington's Chorea, peptic ulcer disease, and spinal cord injury. In cancer patients, males (but not females) with disseminated disease were at greatest risk especially soon after diagnosis. GI cancers as well as chemotherapy or no treatment compared with surgery or radiation therapy placed patients at higher risk. The increased risk with chemotherapy is thought to be related to greater disease severity and consequently poorer prognosis and hopelesness. Huntington's is thought to be related to affective symptoms, peptic ulcer to alcoholism, and spinal cord injury to the possibility that the personalities of these individuals are inherently impulsive and self-destructive. Interestingly, while increased disease severity increased suicide risk in cancer patients, partial injury in spinal cord injury victims was associated with increased risk, possibly reflecting a decreased ability for these patients to adapt mentally. Head injury and suicide is related to cognitive function loss, personality change, and alcohol use.      <P>  Other diseases with a questionable increased risk for suicide include epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Increased suicide risk after improvement in temperal lobe epilepsy has been thought to be due to the possibility of depression emerging after cessation of recurrent convulsions and/or difficulty adjusting to life without a handicap. Rheumatoid arthritis may elevate suicide risk secondary to chronic pain, progressive disability, isolation from others, and steroid use. Multiple sclerosis may have an association with depression. <P>STUDIES OF ATTEMPTED AND COMPLETED SUICIDES IN MEDICAL PATIENTS      <P> A number of retrospective studies have looked at completed suicides. One (19) found 10 of 11 related to jumping or falls, with 7 of 11 having symptoms of delirium. The authors speculate that these patients may have either been paranoid and jumped in order to escape something and/or had motoric impairment. Defining these patients as suicidal may be problematic as it seems unclear whether the patients in this study wanted to die or whether they died accidently due to OBS.       <P> Another study (4) reviewed suicides at the Bronx VA  and found a relationship to severe, chronic, terminal illness, with pain dyspnea and disfigurement. These investigators concluded that lonliness, loss of function, loss of  physical and financial independence, and the prospect of certain death lead patients to make their own life-death risk/benefit analysis.      <P>  Other studies (7,18) characterized patients as having impaired relationships, high family stress, excess emotional stress over their illness, a low pain tolerance, and a need to control the treatment. These patients were anxious and depressed over their illnesses and had poor relationships with staff who in turn reacted to them in a less supportive fashion. A general lack of emotional support as well as prior suicide threats were also present. Impaired alertness or disorientation was not correlated. There were 32 suicides in this study (18) from 1955 to 1960 at the Bronx VA hospital, 56% suicided by jumping, with wrist cutting and hanging next most frequent.        <P>  In another study of 22 completers from 1967-1973 (10), delerium tremens was common, and from 1967-1973 at Brigham Hospital in Boston, a study (20) of 17 mostly female attempters found a relationship to imminent discharge or a change in social supports. This study found all attempts to be impulsive, associated with anger, and precipitated by loss of emotional support. These attempts were largely by patients with personality disorder and psychosis.       <P> Dialysis (1) and malignancies (6) have also been associated with suicidal behavior. Reports differ from 30% to uncommon in the number who threaten suicide beforehand.      <P> To summarize these studies, the suicide completion rate in general hospitals is low, usually in males who jump and leave no suicide note. Many are associated with alcoholism and OBS, cancer and dsypnea, often these patients are demanding and dissatisfied. Because the OBS patients may be better considered as accidental deaths, these reports may actually be describing more than one population of patients. No cases of murder-suicide were found in the literature. Protection from open stairwells, laundry chutes, and upper story windows, and removal of sharps and potentially harmful substances are important protective measures. Suicides that seem rational in medical patients were unusual. <P> STUDIES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CHARACTERIZE AND EVALUATE PATIENTS WITH SUICIDAL IDEATION      <P>  Very few studies have reported on suicidal ideation in medical patients and fewer have been a prospective attempt to characterize these patients. One study (16) over a two year period in Nova Scotia reported 24% of 692 consultations for suicidal ideation, 11.6%  wishing to die imminently. More than 50% of suicidal patients were under 35 years of age, 42% dependent on alcohol, and many of those with abuse of street drugs. The report was in French and the English abstract did not specify whether the suicidal cases included those admitted for medical complications of a suicide attempt, which seemed likely due to the age distribution of the patients.       <P>  Hale et al. (12)  reported on an analysis of patients in the general hospital with suicidal ideation. 116 patients admitted for suicide attempts as well as those consulted on for suicidal ideation were studied. This made up 13% of all consultations. 66%  were patients admitted folowing an attempt and 34% had suicidal ideation during admission for a medical illness. The average age of the attempters (35.4 years) was significantly lower than those with suicidal ideation (45.5 years), and while the the vast majority (89%) of the attempters were transferred to a psychiatric ward, fewer of those with suicidal ideation (25%) were transferred to psychiatry. Medically ill patients were more likely to have an adjustment disorder whereas suicide attempters were more likely to have schizophrenia. Though there was no systematic attempt to identify the precipitants of suicide, the authors noted that suicidal ideation seemed to arise during periods when pain and suffering were intense and survival questionable.        <P> We had recently published a prospective report on the characteristics of patients in the medical setting who have suicidal ideation (3). The purpose of this study was to formulate a data base that would allow psychiatrists to better discriminate those patients who are at greater risk for completed suicide. Comparison of medical patients with suicidal ideation with those who had attempted or completed suicide, and recommendations to reduce suicidal impulses and treat these patients were discussed.      <P> We also looked at those vaiables that were associated with greater suicidal impulses in our study in order to further deliniate potential high-risk patients. Our study did not limit itself to a retrospective analysis of actual attempts or completed suicides as in previous studies. Data were collected from the pool of psychiatric consult requests at Montefiore Medical Center, a 700-bed general hospital located in the Bronx, New York City.     <P>  The study was conducted over a 4-month period, from February to June 1991. These were patients who verbalized suicidal ideas to the treating clinicians, nursing staff, or family, who then relayed this information to staff. Approximately 9% of all psychiatric consultations at our institution  were to evaluate suicidality.     <P>  Because of this study's focus on suicidality in the hospital, consults to evaluate patients admitted for medical consequences of suicide attempts were excluded. Psychiatric consultants completed the Suicidal Ideation Assessment Form (SIAF) (see Appendix), a consultant-rated questionnaire, during the course of a consultation for suicide evaluation. Degree of suicidal intent was rated  by subscales from the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center Psychiatric Emergency Room Violence and Suicide Assessment Form (9). Other data was collected via the Patient consultation Record (PCR) described elsewhere (15).       <P> The main findings included a possible trend towards high male representation among the suicidal subjects, high axis four stress ratings, and a large drop in GAF in the prior year. There was a trend towards acute medical conditions and acute suicidal ideation, few with prior attempts. Few required constant observation, but in our institution, 15-minute checks could also be recommended and were not recorded on the database. The average age of the patients with suicidal ideation was 55 years, and neither age nor any other demographic variable differed from the consultations as a whole. Interestingly this compares to a study by Collins et al. (5) who found more requests for suicide and  depression evaluation in Hispanics and fewer such requests in Blacks.     <P>  The more serious recent suicidal behavior patients were those who tended to have poorer social supports and prior attempts compared with the less serious recent suicidal behavior patients. The more serious patients on current suicidal thoughts were those who had greater current physical distress ratings.It may be that the more serious suicidal patients represent a different subgroup with different characteristics than the less serious group.    <P> Prior studies (7,20) of suicidal attempter/completer medical patients describe these patients as being demanding, angry and impulsive, personality disordered and psychotic, with precipitants of staff conflict and lack of emotional support. In contrast, this study found a trend towards acute changes in medical condition, minimal staff conflict and no psychosis. There was also only one subject with neoplasm compared with prior studies (6) that found a relation between neoplasm and suicidality. Our findings were consistent with prior studies, showing a correlation with maladaptive (emotional) reaction to illness, loss of physical and role functions,  depression (though this was mentioned only briefly in one past study) (7), and few patients with delirium or dementia (who might hurt themselves, but since they were not considered suicidal, would not have been included in the subject group in our study). While including patients with any suicidal ideation and not just attempters or completers of suicide in our study we may have picked up a population not comparable to the other studies (13), some of the prior studies which included OBS patients may have been studying accidental death rather than suicide.      <P> Treatment for suicidal patients in the general hospital should include those that can enhance social support and address high stress levels (family meetings, therapist support), interventions to diminish physical distress (medical or surgical), treatment for depression (psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy), and interventions to improve physical and role functioning (physical therapy, interpersonal therapy). Attention to patients' reaction to acute changes in their medical condition is also important.     <P>  The detailed study of suicidality in the medical setting is important to an understanding of the interplay between medical, psychological, and social factors in patients referred to psychiatrists for this reason. Further prospective study needs to be done in order to clarify those at risk for suicide and which interventions are most effective. <HR NOSHADE WITH=30%> <P> References   <P>  1.

Instruments included the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), and the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS). Those with physical abuse history, but not sexual abuse history, had significantly different  parental bonding scores and higher DES scores compared to subjects without  physical abuse. DES scores and PBI scores were not corelated. While the PBI was useful in discriminating between those with and those without abuse histories, it did not detect differences in degree of dissociation. Lack of association of sexual abuse to PBI and DES scores may have been due to mild abuse. <P>INTRODUCTION     <P>     While a handful of studies (1-7) have reported on the relationship of parental bonding patterns in eating disorders as measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) (8), none have looked for differences between those with and without histories of child abuse.A number of studies have shown that eating disorders have an association with childhood abuse (9-12), and it seems likely that a history of childhood abuse would be reflected by the pattern of bonding with parents. The PBI may be a suitable instrument for this because it specifically focuses on two axes of bonding: care and protection.      <P>The only study that mentioned childhood abuse in their use of the PBI looked at PBI scores in an inpatient borderline group (13), 86.7% who had histories of sexual abuse. This study found significantly lower care (especially low paternal care) and more overprotection from both parents when compared to normal population data. To date, no study has compared the PBI scores of those with abuse histories to those without in any diagnostic sample.       <P>Studies that have looked at childhood abuse histories and dissociation in eating disorders have found higher levels of dissociation in the group with abuse histories (14, 31) and there has been a significant literature on the association of eating disorders with dissociation (15-22). These studies suggest that  trauma-induced dissociation may be a significant factor in symptom development in a subgroup of eating disorders. Up to now, no studies have looked at the relationship of PBI scores with dissociation.      <P>The anecdotal stereotype of the overbearing mother and the ineffectual father in anorexia (1), as well as the formulation of the families of eating disordered as being rigid, overinmeshed and overprotective (23) have  been studied with the PBI (1-7). Results of these studies have found varying patterns of significant differences on the care and protection scales for each parent when compared to controls (2-7), though notably some (2,3,6,7) found evidence of paternal overprotectiveness tending to go against the picture of the ineffectual father.       <P>The present study sought to investigate the relationship of parental bonding patterns as measured by the PBI with abuse histories and dissociation, and was a pilot attempt to determine the usefulness of the PBI in the assessment of parental bonding of those with abuse histories and/or dissociation.  Considering the high rate of abuse and dissociation in eating disorders, failure to take these variables into account in studies of parental bonding in eating disorders may be one cause for                                                some of the variability in the results.  Characterizing the relationship patients with abuse histories and/or significant dissociative symptoms have with their parents  may help with treatment planning. <P>METHOD<P>Subjects  <P>   Fifty-two female Japanese females diagnosed with eating disorders by DSM-III R criteria (24) (avg. age 24.1 years, S.D.=4.45, age range 17-33) attending  an outpatient eating disorder group were studied. Participation was voluntary and no remuneration was given. 44 of the patients had anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, 4 had bulimia nervosa, 2 had anorexia, and 2 had eating disorder not otherwise specified. None of the patients had evidence of delusions or thought disorder, active mood disorder, organic mental disorder or mental retardation on clinical exam. The patients averaged 13.6 years of schooling.  <P>Instruments      <P>    The PBI (8) is a 25-item self rating questionnaire that asks the subject to describe their parents attitudes and behaviours towards them up to the age of 16. Two subscales, "care", and "protection", are scored for the relationship with each parent. The "care" scale measures warmth, empathy, and emotional support. The "protection" scale measures overprotection, control, and intrusiveness. The subject rates each parent on a Likert-type scale, each item scoring 0-3 (Very like-Moderately like- Moderately unlike- Very unlike).  "Care" items are reflected by statements like, "was affectionate to me", and "protection" items are reflected by statements like, "tended to baby me".      <P>While the responses rely on the subjects own recollections, the validity of the instrument has been supported by studies that show that subjects' ratings correlate strongly with ratings of their parents themselves, siblings, and impartial raters (2,8,25). Age, sex, and social class have minimal effect on scores (Y). Also, by administering the PBI to depressed patients and repeating this when they remitted, it has been shown that the care and protection scores were stable over time (25,26).      <P>The PBI was previously validated in a Japanese population by giving it to 300 high school seniors and their parents (27). Factor analysis yeilded results that were similar to those reported in the original PBI validation studies (8). This study also translated the PBI into Japanese, backtranslating it with minimal differences found.    <P>The Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) is a 28-item visual-analog self reporting scale that is a screening instrument  for dissociative disorders (28). DES scores over 30 are felt to reflect a high likelihood of post-traumatic stress or multiple personality disorder (MPD)( 29).      <P>We used data obtained from a modified self-report version of the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS) (30) to ascertain histories of sexual and physical abuse. The DDIS is a 131-item structured interview that makes DSM III-R diagnoses of all the dissociative disorders, somatization disorder, major depression and borderline personality. It also inquires about a history of substance abuse, child physical and sexual abuse, trance states, schizophrenic symptoms and secondary features of MPD. The DDIS has an overall interrater reliability of 0.68 for the diagnosis of MPD, with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 90%. There is no overall score, results are compared with norms established for MPD in North America. The self-report format was used because Japanese subjects often do not respond directly about sensitive issues in interviews. Detailed analyses of the results of the DDIS given to a Japanese eating disorder cohort are presented in a separate report (31).     <P>The severity scale of the Bulimic Inventory Test (BITE) (32) was used to measure the severity of bulimic behaviors. Other demographic and patient history data were collected from clinical databases. All the instruments used in this study were in Japanese. <P>Procedure    <P> Subjects signed informed consent and were given the questionnaires to take home for completion. Primary treating clinicials both handed out, as well as collected completed questionnaires. Patients were  informed that this was a study looking at various psychologic and childhood experiences, and that the results of the study would in no way affect their treatment. Confidentiality was insured. <P>Data Analysis   <P> Scores were analyzed by correlation testing, t-testing of means, or chi square testing as described in results section. An N for an item reported less than the total N for that group studied reflected a failure of that subject to record an answer for that item or r an "unsure" response.<P>RESULTS<P>(Note: Tables not available on-line).<P>     PBI scores were compared for those patients who reported sexual abuse or physical abuse to those who did not report a history of that category of abuse (Table 1).   Maternal care and  both paternal care and  protection scores were significantly lower for those subjects who reported physical abuse, but not for those with sexual abuse histories.  Maternal protection scores did not differ significantly in either group.   <P>   There were no significant correlations (Fisher's r to z) found between DES scores and PBI scores on any subscale.  There were also no significant differences when we looked at the PBI subscale mean scores in those subjects who scored over 30 on the DES (N=7) versus those scoring below 30 on the DES (N=37), and this may have been  due in part to a small N. The largest visible difference in means, and the only PBI subscale whose mean score had a trend similar to that seen with any of the abuse comparisons, was that of paternal care (DES<30 mean PBI score of 15.4, S.D.=10.2, versus DES>30 mean PBI score of 10.0, S.D.=10.4), the over 30 DES scorers having lower care similar to that seen in those with physical abuse histories.    <P>  Eating disorder severity as assessed by the BITE was compared to PBI subscale scores as well as to DES scores and no significant correlations (Fisher's r to z) were found. <P>     While physical abuse history was associated with those subjects who scored over 30 on the DES (4 of 13 with, and 0 of 27 without physical abuse histories, x2=19.4, df=2, p<.0001), presence of sexual abuse history had no significant relation to DES scores. The average DES score of those with histories of physical abuse was 22.8 vs. 7.3 for those without physical abuse histories and this was significantly different (t=4.03, df=35, p<.0003).    <P>   Of the 51 subjects who completed the DDIS, 7 subjects filled the three required criteria for the DSM III-R diagnosis of multiple personality and one subject filled the additional two NIMH criteria for multiple personality. The implications of these findings are presented elsewhere (31).    <P> The eating disorder patients with histories of either sexual and/or physical abuse did not differ in number of separations experienced as a child compared with those with no abuse history, and both groups depended mostly on their mothers for care. The group with histories of sexual and/or physical abuse however did experience more changes of residence as a child,18 of 24 for the abused group, 11 of 24 for the non-abused group (X2=4.27, df=1, p=.039). <P>DISCUSSION<P>     This is the first report to our knowledge that has compared parental bonding patterns using the PBI in those with, and those without histories of child abuse in a diagnostic sample, and is the first to use the PBI in a psychiatric population in Japan.<P>     The main positive finding of this study is that patterns of parental bonding significantly differed between those eating disordered patients with histories of child physical abuse compared with those without such histories. Maternal care and Paternal care was significantly lower and  paternal protection was significantly greater in those with histories of physical abuse, but not sexual abuse. Maternal protection scores did not differ for any category of abuse.   <P>   The pattern that emerges is that of an affectionless mother and an affectionless/constraining father in those with histories of physical abuse. The bonding patterns measured on the PBI seemed to be useful in deliniating differences between those with and those without physical abuse histories in this cohort.  Patterns seen in the family relationships of eating disordered patients may also reflect  a reaction to the patient's illness rather than the cause, as well as it is possible that the pattern of parental bonding is a reaction to changes in the patient because of the abuse rather than a primary relationship style.   <P>   One of the reasons why the presence or abscence of sexual abuse histories did not have a significant relationship with paternal bonding as did physical abuse histories, and why physical, but not sexual abuse is related to DES scores over 30, may be that the severity of sexual abuse reported by our subjects did not have the same traumatic impact as that for physical abuse. High dissociation scores have been associated with sexual abuse histories in western studies (29), and it may be that the sexual abuse experienced by the Japanese subjects was milder. This would be consistent with our clinical impressions. Reporting more mild forms of sexual encounters as abuse could potentially dilute any relationship with dissociation or PBI scores.  <P>   While the interpretation of the word "abuse" may have different cultural connotations, our clinical experience is that although sexual abuse seems to occur more frequently in Japan than is acknowledged publicly here, both the frequency and severity of the abuse when it occurs seems to be lower on average than that reported in western studies. We are now examining data on this issue. <P>    The low incidence of child abuse officially reported in Japan (about 6.6 per 100,000 for children under the age of 12) has been explained by the strong family bond and the high value put on children in Japan (33) though there may be other cultural factors. For example, it is common for Japanese mothers to give up their careers to focus almost exclusively on the upbringing and education of their children. An extreme example of the degree to which the mother-child bond can become fused in Japan is illustrated by the murder-suicide in Japan called "oyako-shinju" (34). This is usually committed by a mother on her young children, and is explained that the mother, under severe family/social stress, finds suicide as the only solution. She cannot imagine her children as being able to live-on without her after her death and psychologically considers them to be a part of herself rather than as separate individuals. Although considered a tragedy, Japanese society in general is sympathetic to the mother in this situation. <P>    The greater degree of paternal overprotectiveness  associated with those with physical abuse histories indicates that, at least for the subgroup with histories of physical abuse, the stereotype of the ineffectual father in eating disorders is inapplicable, and indicates that the father-patient relationship is important for therapy in these patients. It should be noted here as well that abuse history may play an important role in the development of eating disorder symptoms in some patients (14).  Because of the differences seen in PBI scores between those with and without abuse histories seen in this study,  it seems prudent to take history of abuse into account when interpreting PBI scores in eating disorders, this had not been done in prior studies (1-7).  <P>   The increased frequency of moves experienced by those with histories of sexual and/or physical abuse may reflect more disruption in these families though we did not examine further details in this study.  <P>    Degree of dissociation measured by the DES and PBI scores had no statistically significant correlation.  Though a possible trend was seen with high DES scores and low paternal care, this needs to be studied in a larger sample.  Because high dissociation is thought to reflect a high likelihood of trauma as a child (29), we hypothesized that parental bonding patterns as measured by the PBI  would correlate with DES scores. This was not the case. It could have been that  while this was true for some subjects,  group heterogeneity  may have  diluted this out. Alternatively, it may be that the PBI is not sensitive to those bonding patterns that may be associated with high levels of dissociation.         <P>   While it is possible that relationships with parents do not have an effect on and/or are not affected by dissociation, this does not intuitively seem to be the case and requires further study.   <P>   The limitations of this study include a relatively small sample size, cultural and translation considerations in the interpretation of the questions, and problems inherrent in the PBI itself. The PBI relies on the subjects own retrospective recollections rather than actual documentation of paternal bonding patterns. As mentioned above, however, the PBI has been validated in a Japanese sample (27) and studies have shown that subjects' ratings correlate well with those of significant others (2,8,25).  While the PBI is limited by the rigid nature of the questions and its limited scope of inquiry, it is more objective than clinical interpretations, though they have the advantage of a fuller and deeper description (1). Additionally, although the self-report format of the DDIS was a modification, it is unclear whether this was a limitation or, within the cultural context used, may have actually strengthened the reliability of the data due to the privacy afforded.   <P>   It seems reasonable to assume that because parental bonding values were less optimal for those with abuse histories the quality of the attachment to the parents is poorer in these cases. This may be one way in which the failure to experience security in one's relationships leads to the development of what Bowlby termed, "anxious attachment" (35). "Anxious attachment", as opposed to the more pejorative term, "overdependency", may predispose to adult psychopathology and may be a useful concept in the interpersonal treatment of these patients (36).   <P>   The results of this study reinforce the importance of bringing child abuse to attention in Japan. The actual incidence of child abuse in Japan does not seem to be reflected by the official statistics, public awareness is minimal, and neither medical nor mental health workers are adequately trained in this area. Consideration of the quality of parental bonding has important implications for therapy, and possibly for social change in Japan. For example, long work-related absences from the home for the father may impact on paternal care. Future studies conducted in a variety of cultures that address the issues presented in this paper can contribute greatly to our understanding of parental relationships and psychopathology.  <P>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  <P>    The authors thank Drs.

A self-report version of the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS),which includes data on physical and sexual abuse, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) were used. Nine of forty-one subjects who completed the DDIS reported symptoms suggesting DSM-III R multiple personality, and six of the thirty-nine subjects who completed the DES scored over thirty (reflecting a high likelihood of post traumatic stress or multiple personality). Subjects' sexual abuse history rates were considerably greater than those in the Japanese general population. Though physical abuse history was associated with high  dissociation, no difference between the high and low dissociators in  sexual abuse histories was seen.<P>INTRODUCTION   @     <P>Outside of North America there is considerable skepticism about the validity of the dissociative disorders, especially multiple personality disorder (MPD), whose existence is felt to be strongly influenced by culture (1,2). As defined by DSM- III R (3), dissociative disorders are those in which there is a disturbance or alteration in the integrative functions of identity, memory, or consciousness. These include  Psychogenic Fugue, Psychogenic Amnesia, Depersonalzation Disorder, and MPD. The distinctive feature of MPD is the existence of two or more personalities or personality states within the individual (3).    <P>  The large majority of the literature on  dissociation comes from North America (3-9) where the APA created a new diagnostic category, the dissociative disorders, in 1980 (MPD is slated to be called "Dissociative Identity Disorder" in the DSM IV) (10). Additionally, the British literature has suggested that MPD may be culturally specific to North America (11). Although recent reports have found evidence of MPD in the Netherlands (5,12), as well as in Switzerland (13), a study by Takahashi looking at the diagnoses given over a five year period in 489 Japanese psychiatric inpatients did not find one case of MPD, and only seven cases of dissociative disorder (5 with psychogenic fugue and 2 with psychogenic amnesia)(1). This compares with data in North America that suggests 20% of psychiatric inpatients may have a dissociative disorder, 5% of that group having MPD (14).     <P>The Takahashi's study noted the infrequency of the diagnosis of MPD in India (15), and concluded that  the strong family bond in Japan (divorce rate about one third that of the U.S.), the high value put on children, and the low incidence of child abuse there (about 6.6 per 100,000 children under the age of 12), might explain the lack of MPD diagnosed in the sample. This study was criticized for it's failure to use structured diagnostic instruments, the inability to control for skeptical bias, and the failure to report the incidence of childhood abuse in the sample (2,16,17). Very few prior case reports of MPD had been in the Japanese literature (18,19), and these were met with much skepticism in Japan.     <P>The present study was a preliminary attempt to more systematically study the occurance of dissociative and MPD symptoms in Japan. This study used structured instruments already well studied in North America, employed a bicultural team of research psychiatrists, and included an analysis of the relationship with child abuse.     <P> Because of the difficulty studying groups of child abuse victims in Japan (they are often secretive and unwilling to participate in research), we looked at a group of eating disorders (ED) who might be likely to exhibit dissociation. Both ED and MPD have been shown to have an association with childhood physical/sexual abuse (4-6,12,20-23), dissociation has been correlated with eating disorders (8,12,24-28), and both ED and MPD are much more frequent in females(3,6,7).<P>METHOD<P>Subjects     <P> Forty-four Japanese female patients attending an eating disorder out-patient group at the Tokyo Institute of Psychiatry Research Center participated in this study. Participation was voluntary and no renumeration was given. Thirty-five of the patients had bulimia nervosa (eighteen of these had prior histories of anorexia nervosa), one anorexia nervosa, and eight  both anorexia and bulimia. None of the patients had evidence of psychosis, active mood disorder, organic brain syndrome or mental retardation, and none had a history of substance abuse.     <P>The mean age of the patients was 24.2 years (range=17-37). 11 of the patients were married or living with a mate, one divorced, and 32 single. 15 were students, 15 were employed, and 14 were unemployed. The average number of school years completed was 13.6 years. <P>Instruments            <P>The Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) is a 28-item visual-analog (possible scores of 0-100) self-report rating scale, that has a test-retest reliability of 0.84 and good clinical validity (29). It is a screening instrument for dissociative disorders, does not make diagnoses, and takes about ten-minutes to complete. Scores above 30 are correlated with a high likelihood of MPD or post traumatic stress (30). The DES is able to discriminate patients with MPD from other diagnostic groups and normal controls (29,31).     <P>Tanabe et al. recently administered this scale to 445 Japanese university students and found that 28.1% of the subjects scored over 30, with an overall mean of 19.5 (32). A  North American  study of the general population found  mean scores of 15.2 (men) and 15.6 (women) for the 18-29 age group, with declining scores as the subjects age , 5% scoring  over 30 over all age groups (30). While both studies concluded that dissociative symptoms are common it should be noted that the Japanese study only included college students whose young age may have contributed to the 28.1% DES scorers over 30. Based on  the North American data, this percent would be expected to drop as the cohort ages.What proportion of this group actually represents those with dissociative disorder vs. normative "adolescent" data was not investigated, and the North American data did not report what percent scored over 30 in an 18-22 year old group so this can not be compared.     <P>Though the DES has not been validated with a clinical sample of dissociative disorders in Japan, Tanabe reported that DES scores were significantly different in a subgroup of students (N=12) whose frequent dissociative episodes were confirmed by interview compared with  another group (N=23) without dissociative episodes and concluded that this supports the validity of the DES in  a  normal Japanese population (32).       <P> The Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS) is a 131-item structured interview that makes DSM III-R diagnoses of all the dissociative disorders, somatization disorder, major depression and borderline personality (9). It also inquires about a history of substance abuse, child physical and sexual abuse, trance states, schizophrenic symptoms and secondary features of MPD. The DDIS has an overall interrater reliability of 0.68 for the diagnosis of MPD, with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 90%. There is no overall score, results are compared with norms established for MPD in North America. We are not aware of any prior use of the DDIS in Japan.          <P>The DDIS used in this study  was modified  into a self report  questionnaire because Japanese subjects often do not respond directly about sensitive issues in interviews. Additionally, somatic symptoms, psychiatric/substance abuse history, and depressive symptoms were omitted as these areas were covered by clinical reports. The DES, was used in its intended form. Both scales were translated into Japanese; these translations were checked by bilingual  Psychiatrists. The DES version was translated anew and may differ slightly from the version used by Tanabe et al.    <P> We had previously reported on a Japanese case with MPD symptoms who was given the DES and modified DDIS (33). Because the dissociative symptoms in this case as well as other cases in our experience in Japan  were accurately reflected by these instruments, and because of the need to avoid direct questioning about sensitive issues in this population, we feel the preliminary use of the modified self-report DDIS is appropriate.<P>Procedure      <P>Subjects signed informed consent and were given the questionnaires to take home for completion. The primary treating clinicians both handed out, as well as collected completed questionnaires. Subjects were informed that this was a study of looking at various psychologic experiences as well as histories of child abuse. Physical and sexual abuse data was collected via section VII of the DDIS (9). No mention of a purpose to study  multiple personality was made. Confidentiality was ensured. Any subject who filled the three DSM-III R MPD criteria were interviewed to confirm that the subject understood the questions and answered correctly.<P>Results <P>(Note: Tables not available on-line) <P>    Forty-one subjects completed the DDIS section for MPD diagnostic criteria.  Nine (22%) filled the three criteria necessary to make  a DSM III-R diagnosis of MPD. Only one subject filled all five NIMH criteria. Twenty six (63.4) recorded a score of zero in this category.    <P> The subjects who filled three or more MPD diagnostic criteria (DDIS MPD+ group), N=9, m=3.33, SD=0.71, were compared with those filling less than three (non-MPD group), N=32, m=0.25, SD=0.57, on multiple variables. Associated with  the DDIS MPD+ group (Table 1) included an earlier age of onset of anorexia, increased Schneiderian symptomatology, more MPD associated features (includes amnesia-related experiences, flashbacks, voices, derealization, fugue, etc.), higher DES scores, and more subjects were positive for psychogenic amnesia, and fugue.           <P>The DDIS MPD+ group versus the non-MPD group did not differ on any of the areas of: age, eating disorder diagnosis, age of onset of bulimia, height, weight, educational level, social class (34), parental loss, marital status, history of school absenteeism, kleptomania, antisocial features, suicidal ideas/attempts, self mutilation, drug/alcohol abuse, use of psychiatric or medical services, physical and/or sexual abuse histories, domestic violence, Supernatural/Possession/ ESP/ Cult Experiences (supernatural experiences include questions about ghosts, spirits, telekinesis, clairvoyance, telepathy, deja vu, etc.).  <P>  Thirty-nine subjects completed the DES (m=13.56, SD=14.68, range=0-61.1). Because it has been reported that scores above 30 indicate a high likelihood of  MPD or post traumatic stress (30), we compared the subjects who scored above thirty (N=6, m=43.6, SD=10.4) to those below thirty (N=33, m=8.1, SD=6.3) on multiple variables. Variables associated with the greater than 30 group compared to the less than 30 group  (Table 2) included: greater Schneiderian symptomatology, more MPD associated  features, higher scores on borderline pathology, greater total NIMH MPD criteria, histories of physical abuse,  more psychogenic fugue, more depersonalization, and higher scores on the Supernatural/Possession/ESP/Cult experiences section.    <P> The greater than 30 and less than 30 DES score groups did not differ in any of the areas of: height, weight, eating disorder diagnosis, age of onset of anorexia or bulimia, educational level, social class, parental loss, marital status, domestic violence, school absenteeism, kleptomania, antisocial features, suicidal ideas/attempts, self mutilation, use of psychiatric or medical services, sleepwalking, trances, imagimnary playmates, psychogenic amnesia, or histories of sexual abuse.     <P> For the eating disorder sample as a whole (N=44), the combined physical and sexual abuse rate was 45.5%, for physical abuse alone 25.0%, and for sexual abuse alone 36.3%.       <P>As can be seen from Table 1 and Table 2, while the DDIS MPD+ group had greater DES scores compared to the non-MPD group, and the greater than 30 Des scorers had more MPD criteria than the less than 30 DES scorers, there was overlap in that not all of the DDIS MPD+ group scored greater than 30 on the DES, and not all the greater than 30 DES scorers filled the three necessary criteria for MPD. Only three subjects (of N=36) scored both over 30 DES and filled MPD criteria.     <P>Of the forty-four subjects, thirteen (29.5%, m=6.2, SD=1.1) filled the five DSM III-R necessary criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD), while thirty-one did not (70.5%, m=2.0, SD=1.4). Neither physical nor sexual abuse differed in our BPD vs. non-BPD group. The BPD group differed from the non-BPD group (Table 3) in having greater schneiderian symptoms, more MPD associated features, more MPD NIMH criteria (though the BPD group mean of 1.8 was well below the three necessary for the diagnosis of MPD), and greater DES scores. There was a trend for more of the BPD patients to have more MPD associated features though this did not reach significance. There were no differences in any of the other variables tested.<P>DISCUSSION    <P> These findings provide the first data on evidence for significant dissociative symptomatology and the existence of MPD-like symptomatology in a psychiatric population in Japan. The limitations of this study included a small N, cultural considerations in the interpretations of  questions, and possibly self-reporting. Even though the self-reporting format was a modification, this may have actually strengthened the reliability of our data due to the privacy afforded, though this preliminary study was not designed to answer this question.     <P>  Data was gathered by reliable instruments, and the patients who filled DSM III-R MPD criteria reflected the pattern of data obtained by Ross et al. (9) from MPD subjects in North America.  Although the patient populations differed (ours were attending a eating disorders clinic, while those in the study by Ross et al. a dissociative disorders clinic), in both studies the  patients had high scores in (our study DDIS MPD+ N=9 vs. mean of 102 North American MPD cases):  Schneiderian first-rank symptoms, 6.6 vs. 6.4; MPD associated features, 7.2 vs 10.2; and BPD criteria, 4.4 vs. 5.2. This pattern distinguished MPD from other diagnostic groups in North America (35). Additionally, psychogenic amnesia  and high DES scores were found in our DDIS MPD+ cases, consistent with the North American data.      <P>Our DDIS MPD+ patients also had an earlier age of onset of anorexia which may reflect a subset of patients in whom dissociation and anorexia are related. While nine of our eating disorder patients filled the three DSM III-R diagnostic criteria for MPD, we suspect (though did not verify) this number may be high for actual MPD and probably reflects significant dissociative pathology, or atypical MPD (ie. transient symptoms), rather than the strict diagnosis of MPD in many of our cases. While the effects of a relatively young age of our cohort should also be considered as a possible contributing factor to increased dissociation (30), good construct validity for the dissociative disorders has been demonstrated in children and adolescents (36).    <P> The DDIS findings were also confirmed by the DES scale scores of our cohort. Our DDIS MPD+ patients' mean DES score of 26.8 reflects the high scores obtained in North American MPD and posttraumatic stress disorder patients compared with other diagnostic groups (9,29,31). Our eating disorder overall mean DES score of 13.56 was similar to the score of  19.5 in 445 Japanese college students (32), as well as the score of 15.6 found in 609 women in the18-29 age range in the general population  (30).     <P>While the DES data suggests that dissociative symptoms are not specific to eating disorders, our nine patients (22%) who were DDIS MPD+ indicate that a subset of eating disorder patients have a relationship with high levels of dissociation and that this group requires special attention to the effects of dissociation on psychopathology and treatment. This is consistent with studies in America and Europe which had found a relationship between eating disorders and dissociation (8,12,24-28).     <P>The DES  data in Japan support the idea that dissociation is a continuous process ranging from normal phenomena to serious pathology (28) and helps to validate the use of the DES in clinical samples in Japan. At what point do dissociative experiences become pathological? This question was posed by Ross et al. (30) who posited that while a definitive study requires coadministration of the DES and a diagnostic interview to a random sample of the general population, clinical studies using the DES (14) suggest that dissociative disorders may be relatively common, in the range of 5%-10% of the general population.     <P> The fact that only three subjects had scores >30 on the DES and were also DDIS MPD+  can be interpreted in different ways. Our DDIS MPD+ subjects may not necessarily meet strict DSM-III R MPD criteria if they only have transient symptoms, and thus their DES scores could be lower. Some with high DES scores may have other dissociative disorders not in the MPD spectrum (ie. psychogenic fugue/amnesia). While there could be other explanations, for example problems with the validity of these instruments, cultural/language difficulties with the instruments etc., the fact that 3 of 6 (50%) of the >30 DES scorers were DDIS MPD+, and that the 26.8 DES score of the DDIS MPD+ group was significantly greater than the 10.1 DES score of the non-MPD group supports the validity of these assessment procedures consistent with that the North American studies. The DES score of 30 as a cut-off point, however, may need to be reconsidered depending on the population studied. <P>The other variables listed in Table 2 that were associated with the over 30 DES scores is also consistent with the North American data. We noted that while physical abuse had an association with high DES scores, sexual abuse did not, and neither physical nor sexual abuse was  associated with our DDIS MPD+ subjects. While these results will have to be replicated in a larger group of Japanese subjects with dissociative disorders, this seems at odds with the western data. Four large western studies all found between 75%-90% of MPD subjects positive for either sexual or physical abuse( 12,37-39 ). False negative results due to small sample size  could  have been responsible for this, as well as for the of the lack of association of abuse with BPD in our study. The association of physical abuse and high DES scores in our study, however, supports the hypothesis of childhood trauma leading to dissociation.      <P>The 36.3% of sexual abuse reported in our eating disorder subjects  indicates that an overall lack of reported sexual abuse was not responsible for our finding of no relationship of sexual abuse and dissociation. This value is considerably  greater than the official Japanese statistic of 0.0066% for child abuse, including sexual abuse, in the general population(1), and may reflect an association between eating disorders and sexual abuse in Japan, and/or a low bias in the Japanese general population statistics. It could be that the Japanese subjects' interpretations of these questions (sexual abuse has not become a topic widely discussed in Japanese society as in the west ) led more of our subjects to consider past minor sexual encounters as "abuse", obscuring any relationship with sexual abuse that the high dissociators may have had, and making our data difficult to compare with official statistics. Another potential problem is that of recall bias, ie., the questionable reliability of adult reports of childhood abuse without corroboration (40).     <P>We also found a considerable overlap of the diagnosis of BPD with dissociation (Tables 2,3), consistent with western research (5,9,12,39).  While amnesia was more often reported in our DDIS MPD+ group vs non-MPD group, there was no difference in this variable between the group who filled the DSM III-R criteria for borderline personality and those who did not, consistent with western studies (5,12,41) that showed that amnesia distinguished MPD from BPD.     <P> While our data is based on only 9 DDIS MPD+ subjects, this adds to the already significant literature. Table 3 shows that while BPD is associated with considerable dissociative experiences, DES score of 24.4 for the BPD group vs. 8.7 for the non-BPD group, this score is still considerably lower than the  score of 41.4 in a North American sample of  82 patients with MPD (37). Patients with MPD symptom-atology exhibit significant borderline pathology,and vice-versa , and this may relate to similarly disruptive childhood experiences and use of maladaptive defenses. Dissociative experiences seem to occur in a wide range of psychiatric pathology, just as depression and anxiety may occur in various disorders (30).    <P> An additional finding was the lack of any association in our patients with dissociation and suicide attempts/ideation as had been found in the western research (12,42,43)                                        <P> This preliminary study is the first to find systematic evidence of considerable dissociative symptomatology and child abuse in a Japanese psychiatric population, and is an addition to the literature that dissociation and MPD related symptomatology are world-wide phenomena. There was also a considerable amount of physical and sexual abuse in our eating disorder subjects' histories although we did not ascertain the exact severity of abuse.  If the lack of association of sexual abuse histories with  dissociation in Japan is replicated in larger samples it will be important to look into those aspects of Japanese society that make this a divergent finding from western studies.      <P> This study suggests that it will be important for Japanese clinicians to become more acquainted with dissociative symptoms and the psychological effects of child abuse so that improved detection and treatment for these problems can be instituted. Future studies need to  further clarify the relationships between sexual abuse, dissociation, and eating disorders in Japan. <HR NOSHADE WITH=30%><P>REFERENCES<P>1.)

<P>Sir: The literature (1) has suggested that multiple personality does not exist in Japan because of the low reported incidence of child abuse there. We report a Japanese case (2) with MPD symptoms given structured testing for dissociation.<Blockquote>After breaking with her boyfriend, a 19 year old Japanese female suddenly developed amnesia, alternate distinct personalities, occasional auditory hallucinations of an alternate personality (she was aware the voices weren't real), and fugue. She had no past medical, psychiatric, drug/alcohol, or significant family history. She witnessed her mother die suddenly from a subarachnoid bleed at 13 years old.      <P>Inpatient treatment included individual, milieu, and recreation therapies, and medication (Sulpiride, 300mg po Qd for anxiety, and Lormetazepam 1mg po QHs for sleep). Work-up including blood tests, neurologic exam, CT, and EEG were negative. Overall IQ was 102. There were no symptoms of mood disorder, and no thought disorder. Personality alternation and hallucinations ceased after admission and sulpride was discontinued after 6 weeks. After 4 months she was discharged to outpatient on no medication. <P>Ten months later we administered the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS)(3), and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES)(4) in Japanese (the first use of these scales in Japan that we are aware of). The DDIS was modified into a self report questionnaire because Japanese may not respond directly about sensitive issues in interviews. Informed consent was obtained.<P>Scores on the DDIS subscales tested were (patient vs means of 102 American MPD cases): Schneiderian Symptoms= 3 vs 6.4, Secondary features of MPD= 8 vs 10.2, Borderline Criteria= 0 vs 5.2 , ESP (includes supernatural experiences, ESP experiences, and cult involvement)= 3 vs 5.6. Over five secondary features of MPD may be pathognomonic for MPD (3). The patient also reported amnesia, trances, fugue and depersonalization, but no abuse. 95.1% of American MPD cases reported abuse (3).  On the DES she scored 41.7, compared with a mean of 41.4 for 82 American MPD cases (3). Scores above 30 are correlated with a high likelihood of MPD or Post Traumatic Stress (4).</Blockquote><P>The dissociative symptoms in this case were accurately reflected by western instruments. Witnessing her mother's death may have been psychologically similar to an abusive experience. Although we are attempting to study dissociation and abuse here, abuse  groups in Japan are secretive (possibly biasing official statis-  tics), and reluctant to participate in research. We hope studies  of this type will help break the ice.                             <P>                       REFERENCES     <P>1.

<P>To the Editor.----The article by Byne and Parsons1 in the March 1993 issue of Archivesproposed an  interesting "interactionist model" of sexual orientation after a thorough review of the biologic research in this area. While they criticized the biologists (and to a much lesser degree the psychosocial theories) for not integrating the two theoretical approaches, they too seem to be inflexible for not allowing for the possibility that not all homosexual individuals need to necessarily fit into one model  (including theirs).   <P>  Inconsistencies in the data may be reflective of different subpopulations of homosexuals, some who's sexual orientation may be biologically determined, some psychocially determined, and some who are better described by an interactionist model. Some patients with hypertension may have purely genetic causes, some diet,  some an interaction of the two etc.  <P>   We agree with their statement that it is imperitive to "resist the urge to search for simplistic explanations" (p.236),  and stress the need to be flexible when considering the determints of sexual orientation for any one individual- a point also relevant to clinical work. Because the topic of homosexuality is emotionally charged there may be a tendency to try to package all homosexual behavior into one model (even if it permits interactions among other models). Allowance for individual variation would do well for a field where the bias among the workers is also varied and where the data is still inconclusive. <P>Douglas Berger, M.D.<P>Hiroyuki Suematsu, M.D.<P>Dept. of Psychosomatic Medicine, Tokyo University Branch Hospital<P>Yutaka Ono, M.D.<P>Keio University Department of Psychiatry, Shinanomachi, Shinju-ku, Tokyo Japan <P> 1.

@  <p> To the Editor: In a recent book review (1), Rebecca Z. Solomon, M.D., stated the "Japanese concept of <I>Doi</I>, for which there is no equivalent in any other language, expresses the modulation of demandingness by appreciation of the condition of the one on whom the demand is made." The correct name of this concept is <I>amae</I>. <I>Doi</I> is not a concept but the name of the Japanese psychiatrist, Takeo Doi, who popularized the concept of <I>amae</I> (2).   <p><I>Amae</I> may be described as a mutual dependency (including that between adult and child) where the assurance of another's goodwill permits a certain degree of self-indulgence. A Western concept that Doi felt was equivalent to <I>amae</I> is that of "passive object love" described by Michael Balint (3).   <p>The concept of <I>amae</I> is felt by some to be a key toward understanding the whole of Japanese society and to resolve the apparent contradictions seen there.John Bester, in his foreword to Doi's book, wrote, "Only a mentality rooted in <I>amae</I> could produce a people so unrealistic yet so clearsighted as to the basic human condition; so compassionate and so self-centered; so spiritual and so materialistic; so forbearing and so willful; so dicile and so violent."   <p>Perhaps a quote from Doi's own experience when first visiting America will highlight the concept of <I>amae</I>:<p><Blockquote>I visited a house of someone to whom I had been introduced by a Japanese acquaintance, and was talking to him whin he asked me, "Are you hungry? We have some ice cream if you'd like it." As I remember, I was rather hungry, but finding myself asked point-blank if I was hungry by someone whom I was visiting for the first time, I could not bring myself to admit it, and ended by denying the suggestion. I probably cherished a mild hope that he would press me again; but my host, disappointingly said "I see" with no further ado, leaving me regretting that I had not replied more honestly.And I found myself thinking that a Japanese would almost never ask a stranger unceremoniously if he was hungry, but would produce something to give him without asking.</Blockquote>   <p>We suppose that cultural differences in <I>amae</I> lead to many misunderstandings in one of the world's most important economic and political international relationships.

</strong>    <P> <P> Department of Psychiatry Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx New York U.S.A.<P> ABSTRACT: Psychiatrists in a general hospital setting were given a questionnaire aimed at characterizing patients' suicidality. Patients evaluated for suicidality were studied for demographic, medical, psychiatric, and suicidal variables. Comparison with medical patients who had attempted/completed suicide in prior studies and recommendations to reduce suicidal impulses and improve the database were discussed.<P> Key Words: suicide, evaluation, medical illness/patient<P> INTRODUCTION<P> Suicidal patients are among the most challenging patients to confront a psychiatrist in the general medical setting. Chronic medical illness and pain have been found to be risk factors for suicide [2,5,7,9]. Psychiatrists working in general medical hospitals often get called to evaluate patients for suicidality. Approximately 9% of all psychiatric consultations at our institution are to evaluate suicidality. Because these high-risk patients have not been well studied, we felt that characterizing this group would give an empirical foundation for evaluation and treatment recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This was a pilot study aimed at studying the potential usefulness of a database that attempted to characterize any patient referred for suicide evaluation. Our study did not limit itself to a retrospective analysis of actual attempts or completed suicides as in previous studies. <P>   Prior studies attempted to identify characteristics of medical patients who had attempted or completed suicide while hospitalized. One study found all attempts to be impulsive, associated with anger, and precipitated by loss of emotional support (11). These attempts were largely by patients with personality disorder and psychosis. Another study (4) characterized patients as having impaired relationships, excess emotional stress over their illness, a low pain tolerance, and a need to control the treatment. A general lack of emotional support as well as prior suicide threats were also present. Impaired alertness or disorientation was not correlated. Dialysis (1) and malignancies (3) have also been associated with suicidal behavior.<P> The purpose of comparing our group of patients with suicidal ideation to attempters or completers of suicide in the medical setting is to study the variables that these groups have in common and those that differ. This may allow clinicians to identify high-risk factors for suicide in patients who are consulted on for suicidal ideation. We also looked at those vaiables that were associated with greater suicidal impulses in our study in order to further deliniate potential high-risk patients.<P> METHODS<P> Subjects <P>   Data were collected from the pool of psychiatric consult requests at Montefiore Medical Center, a 700-bed general hospital located in the Bronx, New York City. The study was conducted over a 4-month period, from February to June 1991. Databases were kept in the locked files of the researchers to protect patient anonymity. All patients were included for whom an initial consultation request was made to evaluate suicidality. These were patients who verbalized suicidal ideas to the treating clinicians, nursing staff, or family, who then relayed this information to staff.Because of this study's focus on suicidality in the hospital, consults to evaluate patients admitted for medical consequences of suicide attempts were excluded.<P> Procedure<P> Psychiatric consultants completed the Suicidal Ideation Assessment Form (SIAF) (see Appendix), a consultant-rated questionnaire, during the course of a consultation for suicide evaluation. The SIAF took approximately 5 minutes to complete for each patient. Initial orientation to the SIAF and ongoing review with the consultants by the researcher provided rating instruction.<P> Details of the variables studied in the database are included in the Results section. Degree of suicidal intent was rated by the two suicide subscales (ratings of current suicidal thoughts and recent suicidal behaviors) of the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center Psychiatric Emergency Room Violence and Suicide Assessment Form (6). This scale consists of a degree of impulsivity rating, as described under Results. Additional patient information was obtained from the Patient Consultation Record (PCR) described elsewhere [10]. The PCR consists of demographic data, Axis 1-4 diagnoses, and other consultation related information.<P> Statistical comparisons used two-tailed t-tests, Chi-square tests, or data were presented as percentages of the whole as described under Results.<P> RESULTS<P> Demographic Data<P> Twenty-seven completed SIAF questionnaires were included in this study, or about 9% of the total psychiatric consultation requests during this 4-month period. Incomplete data on some items is reflected in the total number reported for that item. PCR data were located on only 20 questionnaires because either the patient's name or chart number was not recorded on the SIAF. Subject data not compared with the whole was due to that variable being included in the SIAF though not in the PCR.<P> Subjects included 13 (65%) men and 7 (35%) women, with a mean age of 55 years. There was an almost even distribution of patients representing all age groups from 25 to over 75 years old. Racial groups included 9 (45%) Caucasians, 4 (20%) blacks, 6 (30%) Hispanics, and 1 (5%) Asian. Three (15%) were currently married and 16 (80%) were either single, separated, divorced, or widowed. Eight (40%) patients were Catholic, 6 (30%) were Jewish, 5 (25%) were Protestant, and 1(5%) came under the category Other. Nine (33.3%) patients lived alone, 15 (55.6%) lived with family, and 1(3.7%) lived in a nursing home. Five (18.5%) were working, 5 (18.5%) were disabled, 10 (37%) were retired, and 7 (25.9%) were unemployed (82.4% of patients were not in the active work force). Social supports were rated (in the clinicians' estimates) as poor in 5 (18.5%), fair in 9 (33.3%), good in 10 (37%), and excellent in 2 (7.7%).<P> Axis 4 stress level was rated from 1 (no stress) to 6 (catastrophic): 15 (75%) were rated as 5 or 6 level of stress. On Axis 5 global assessment of functioning (GAF), 17 (85%) were functioning above the 70 level in the past year and 8 (40%) remained above this level at the time of consultation.<P> Demographic data were compared with the PCR data for all consultation requests during the same 4month period (N = 277). There were no differences on age, race, marital status, religion, residence status, or global assessment of functioning.<P> There was a trend toward more male patients in the group consulted for suicidality (44% male in the group as a whole vs 65% suicidal, X2 = 2.87, df = 1, p = 0.09), as well as higher axis 4 stress levels in the suicidal group (54% axis 5 or 6 in the group as a whole vs 75% suicidal, X2 = 2.87, df = 1, y = 0.09). Neither social supports nor occupational status were recorded on the PCR data and could not be compared.<P> Medical Situation Data<P> Twelve (60%) of the suicide evaluations were on the medical service, 4 (20%) were on surgery, and 2 (10%) were on neurology/neurosurgery. This was similar in distribution to the consultations as a whole (all consultation requests for any reason). Though both the primary reason for hospitalizatioll as well as medical diagnosis spanned a gamut of conditions, it was notable that only one patient (3.7%) had a diagnosis of neoplasm compared with 56 (19%) of the whole. None of the subjects were on dialysis. Eight (40%) of the suicidal consults were diagnosed with delirium or dementia, whereas 165 (59%) were for the whole; this difference did not reach statistical significance.<P> Medical condition was rated as acute in 15 (55.6%) and chronic in 7 (25.9%). Five (18.5%) were rated terminal, and none with imminent death. Approximately half of the subjects were rated as either in physical pain or physical distress. Mean values for all sucidal subjects on a 0-10 visual analog scale were 3.5 for physical pain and 4.0 for physical distress, respectively.<P> Suicidal Characteristics<P> Eighteen (79%) of the subjects were consulted on within the first week after admission for assessment of suicidality. Breakdown of current suicidal thoughts (highest during current hospitalization), rated from 1 (no suicidal ideas) to 5 (intense wish for suicide) was 8 (29.6%) rated 1,11 (40.7%) rated 2, 5 (18.5%) rated 3, and 3 (11.1%) rated 5. Mean value was 2.3 (SD 1.3). Recent suicidal behaviors (during the past several weeks) were rated from 1 (no plans or attempts) to 6 (made a serious attempt). Results were 13 (48.1%) rated 1, 8 (29.6%) rated 2,1 (3.7%) rated 3, 2 (7.4%) rated 4, and 3 (11.1%) rated 6. Mean value was 2.1 (SD 1.6).<P> Suicidal ideas were rated chronic in only 6 (22.2%) cases and acute in 20 (74.1%). Five (18.5%) had made prior attempts, 2 of which were considered as having a serious prior attempt.<P> At the time of evaluation, clinicians rated subjects' affect as depressed/sad/despair in 17 (63%), angry/frustrated in 3 (11%), anxious in 1 (3.7%), intoxicated in 1(3.7%), and left this section unrated or not known in 5 (18.5%). Though given the opportunity to do so on the PCR, clinicians did not make a personality disorder diagnosis on these subjects, and no retrospective personality analysis was done.<P> Constant observation was ordered in 6 (30%) subjects with a mean duration of 2 days. There were no actual suicide attempts during this study period. Subjects were seen on an average of 5.3 follow-up visits by the psychiatrist. No significant data were found for room type or time of day that suicidal ideation was verbalized.<P> Precipitant of Suicidality Data<P> There was no limit to the number of precipitants that could be recorded for any subject. In decreasing frequency, the number of subjects rated with the following precipitants were as follows: 15 (55.6%) acute change in medical condition (new onset of symptoms or patient was informed of or perceived a change in diagnosis/prognosis (DX/PX) for the worse); 12 (44.4%) loss of physical function; 11 (40.4%) loss of role function; 9 (33.3%) maladaptive reaction to illness; 9 (33.3%) major depression; 6 (22.2%) reaction to pain; 6 (22.2%) interpersonal conflict; 5 (18%) conflict with staff; 4 (14.8%) family conflict; 4 (14.8%) bereavement; 3 (11.1%) organic disorder (delirium/dementia); 3 (11.1%) reaction to acute loss of emotional support; 3 (11.1%) related to loss of face (real or perceived); 2 (7.4%) related to drug or alcohol (intoxication or withdrawal); 2 (7.4%) attempt to manipulate patient's social situation; none rated as due to conflict with other patients or due to psychosis.<P> Comparison of High and Low Suicidal Impulses<P> Comparisons of both current suicidal thoughts and recent suicidal behaviors for those patients who had none or only mild suicidal impulses to those who had more serious impulses were made for each item on the SIAF. For recent suicidal behaviors, subjects rated 1 or 2 were considered less serious (N = 21, mean 1.4, SD 0.5), and those rated 3 or more were more serious (N = 6, mean 4.8, SD 1.3).<P> Only social supports differed significantly between less serious and more serious groups on recent suicidal behavior. Social supports were rated from 1 (none) to 5 (excellent). The less serious recent suicidal behavior group's social supports (mean 3.5, SD 0.8) differed significantly from the more serious (mean 2.6, SD 0.9) (t = 2.2 df = 25, p = 0.03); the more serious suicidal group was associated with poorer social supports. There was also a trend for prior attempts (rated as 1 Iyes] and 2 [no]) to differ between these groupsNIIle less serious recent suicidal behavior group (mean 1.9, SD 0.3) tended not to have prior attempts compared with the more serious group (mean 1.4, SD 0.5) (x = 2.8, df = 1, p = 0.09). The less and more serious groups on recent suicidal behavior maintained these differences when compared for current suicidal thoughts (rated similarly). The less serious group (mean 1.8, SD 0.7) differed significantly from the more serious group (mean 3.7, SD 2.0) (t = 3.6 df = 25, p = 0.001).<P> Current suicidal thoughts were also broken down into less serious (rated 1 or 2, N = 19, mean 1.6, SD 0.5) and more serious (rated 3 or more, N = 8, mean 3.9, SD 1.2).Only one item on the SIAF differed significantly for the less and more serious groups on current suicidal thoughts. Current physical distress ratings, rated 0 (no distress) to 10 (would rather die), were statistically different for the less serious (mean 2.9, SD 2.2) compared with the more serious group on current suicidal thoughts (mean 7.0, SD 2.3) (t = 3.5, df = 25, p = 0.003). The less and more serious groups on current suicidal thoughts maintained these differences when compared for recent suicidal behavior. The less serious group (mean 1.6, SD 1.2) differed from the more serious group (mean 3.3, SD 1.9) (t = 2.9, df = 25, p = 0.01).<P> DISCUSSION<P> This was a pilot study that attempted to determine if a database such as the SIAF could be used as an effective means to characterize patients who are seen in consultation in the medical setting for suicide evaluation and to recommend areas that warrant further study.Some of the limitations of this study included a limited study duration and a small number of subjects. Items were rated by clinical impression rather than specific criteria sets and there were no interrater reliability checks. Study orientation meetings and discussion with the researchers may have helped limit clinician rating variance.<P> Results of this study that deserve further investigation include a possible trend towards high male representation among the suicidal subjects, high axis four stress ratings, and a large drop in GAF in the prior year. There was a trend towards acute medical conditions and acute suicidal ideation, few with prior attempts. Few required constant observation, but in our institution, 15-minute checks could also be recommended and were not recorded on the database.<P> The more serious recent suicidal behavior patients were those who tended to have poorer social supports and prior attempts compared with the less serious recent suicidal behavior patients. The more serious patients on current suicidal thoughts were those who had greater current physical distress ratings.<P> It may be that the more serious suicidal patients represent a different subgroup with different characteristics than the less serious group. Further clarification of these differences in a larger subject sample would be helpful. A more refined definition of physical distress also needs consideration.<P> Prior studies (4,11) of suicidal attempter/completer medical patients describe these patients as being demanding, angry and impulsive, personality disordered and psychotic, with precipitants of staff conflict and lack of emotional support. In contrast, this study found a trend towards acute changes in medical condition, loss of physical and role functions, and depression. There was minimal staff conflict and no psychosis. There was also only one subject with neoplasm compared with prior studies (3) that found a relation between neoplasm and suicidality. Our findings were consistent with prior studies, showing a correlation with maladaptive (emotional) reaction to illness and few patients with delirium or dementia (who might hurt themselves, but since they were not considered suicidal, would not have been included in the subject group).<P> By including patients with any suicidal ideation and not just attempters/completers of suicide in our study, we may have picked up a mixed population not comparable to the other studies (8). There could have been institutional patient population differences as well as differences in assessment methods that make comparison difficult. Further research needs to address these differences so that psychiatric consultants can begin to look at factors that correlate with more serious suicide risk when called to evaluate for suicidality.Interventions that could enhance social support and address high stress levels (family meetings, therapist support); diminish physical distress (medical or surgical interventions); treat depression (psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy); and improve physical and role functioning (physical therapy, interpersonal therapy) are important avenues that consultants should explore in their recommendations to the primary treating physician. Attention to patients' reaction to acute changes in their medical condition is also important.<P> The detailed study of suicidality in the medical setting is important to an understanding of the interplay of medical, psychological, and social factors in patients referred to psychiatrists for this reason. Studies using databases such as the SIAF and PCR are an effective and time-efficient means of acquiring data for this purpose. More research is needed to refine the database and to make recommendations to clinicians who evaluate suicidal patients in the general medical hospital.<P> References<P> 1.

Saccadic reaction time measured by electro-oculogram was studied in order to minimize complicating variables associated with prior studies using manual reaction time.@  <P> Supporting prior research, this study found that schizphrenics do worse when there is prior information about warning signal duration than when there is not, while in controls this was reversed. Significant enhancement of this effect with increasing age and a possible normalizing effect with greater neuroleptic dose were also found. The major limitations of this study, however, included a small N and uncontrolled medication.   <P> The authors conclude that (a) there is a schizphrenic deficit in the processing of information in order to establish a mental set necessary for preparation, (b) this deficit may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of schizphrenia in older age groups, and (c) effects of antipsychotic medication on information processing require further study. They hypothesize that the effects of neurotransmitters on information processing and time perception, abnormalities in the frontal lobes, and information processing steps measured by evoked potential may play a role in impaired information processing in schizphrenia.

 <hr> <P> DISCUSSION  <P>   Diagnosing psychopathology in medical patients even in the face of "the reality of the situation" is an important task of the general hospital psychiatrist16,18.   A surprising finding in this study was that while the vast majority of psychiatrists agreed that there may be times when suicidal ideation  (91.5%), or completed suicide (78%) in med-surg patients is logical or reasonable, the majority of psychiatrists did not agree even slightly that commiting suicide could be logical or reasonable in terminal illness with major depression irrespective of the  quality of life, or in terminal illness with good quality of life and no major depression. This was despite the fact that 18-32% of psychiatrists had some degree of acceptance of suicide in non-terminal cases with inability to function in various social roles (26% agreeing at least slightly that a murder-suicide could be reasonable), and despite the significant positive relationship of degree of acceptance of suicide as reasonable in non-terminal cases unable to fulfill family duties with rating termination of life support in an incurable non-terminal patient with poor quality of life as a "suicide".   <P>  These results point to an influence on a number of Japanese psychiatrists of the Japanese cultural value of duty and responsibility to others at a level equal to that of life itself, a value seen in the medical setting that can be seen in in other aspects of Japanese culture including intense devotion to one's company even at the expense of one's health (karoshi), suicide in order to take responsibility for something by persons who feel loyal to superiors involved in a scandal (inseki jisatsu), and others9,23,24. Maintenance of the value of duty and responsibility to others in a manner that does not have to call for unnecessary loss of life could be promoted through psychosocial interventions and education of both the general public as well as the medical profession on issues of death and dying.  <P>   These findings also raise the importance of sensitizing Japanese doctors to the need to determine when depression in the terminally ill may affect the decision to forgo life-sustaining medical treatment16-18. While 92% of psychiatrists responded that it is usually or always important to give optimal medical and psychiatric treatment to medical patients who refuse life saving treatment, 25% responded that it may be sometimes, and 10% usually or always, valuable to accept a medical patient's decision to die even if they are depressed. Interestingly, the small group, N=5 who responded that it was only "sometimes" important to give optimal treatment on this item, had significantly greater degrees of agreement on physician assisted suicide in cases of failure in duty to others.  A view of depression in the face of serious illness as reasonable may be a form of "pseudo-empathy" against which psychiatrists should be warned, especially as physicians have been shown to underestimate seriously ill patients' quality of life and their desire for life-sustaining treatment12,28.      @<P>@@ Ganzini et al.16 found that remission of major depression with hopelessness in psychiatric patients increased the preferences of these patients for life-saving treatment, while Chochinov et al.18 and Berger25,26 found that desire for death in med-surg or terminal patients is associated with clinical depression, that this desire for death is often transient, and that improvement in family support and treatment of pain can diminish desire for death.  Because of these findings some authors have even recommended a trial of ECT before accepting a do-not-resuscitate order in patients with affective disorder27. Such findings need to be communicated to the Japanese psychiatric community.   <P>  Interventions that could enhance social support and address high stress levels (family meetings, therapist support); diminish physical distress (medical or surgical interventions); treat depression (psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy); and improve physical and role functioning (physical therapy, interpersonal therapy) are important avenues that psychiatric consultants should explore when faced with med-surg patients with suicidal ideation. Attention to patients' reaction to acute changes in their medical condition is also important25,26.   <P>     Although physician assisted suicide was approved of less often than individual suicide, and  most often for the terminally ill no-major depression cases (41%), almost two-thirds agreed that termination of life-support at the request of a non-terminal patient was allowing the patient to die naturally. These psychiatrists may have been influenced by the wide media coverage of the recent Tokai case described in the introduction in which the court frowned on active intervention on the part of the doctor.<P>             In addition, while the relationship of suicidal ideas among the terminally ill to psychiatric disorder, and the assumption of distorted thinking in medically ill patients who desire death were thought to be at least sometimes the case in the opinion of 92% and 95% of psychiatrists respectively, there was a stronger trend for these psychiatrists to feel "usually" or "always" that psychiatric patients are more likely to have their wishes for death rooted in psychopathology  (93%) when compared with this response for medical patients' psychopathology (39%).     <P>      Respondents who felt that only rarely or sometimes (N=37) was distorted thinking or psychopathology involved in medical patients' wishes to die had a significantly lower mean number year of experience. This younger and less experienced group, which was also more likely to rate termination of life support in an incurable non-terminal patient with poor quality of life as "letting the patient die naturally" rather than a"suicide" or a "killing", may not be as sensitive to the relationship of psychopathology to suicidal ideation in this group of patients as their more experienced colleagues.   <P>  Our study has several strengths and several limitations. First, we choose psychiatrists known to be actively involved in general hospital work who were likely to have actually encountered the proposed situations. The recent media coverage may have informed the psychiatrists further about these issues, although it may have also colored their opinions in the wake of the court's ruling. Limitations include the relatively small sample size. The high degree of cooperation by the respondents and the manner of their selection may have carried with it some inherrent bias. The fixed-response format of the questionnaire could have limited the respondents' ability to evaluate the whole picture as in a real-life situation, although this may also have elicited their uncensored responses.     <P>The findings of this study have important implications for medical personnel, patients, and for policy makers. Courts should actively consider the role of affective impairment in determination of decision making capacity16. Even if there is a living will that coincides with the patient's request, the patient could have been affectively disturbed at the time of making the will, and this might be verified by history. Legislation permitting assisted suicide or euthanasia that guides a psychiatric evaluation would need to specify the need for evaluation of depression, unrecoverable poor quality of life, and, in Japan, degree of distortion in the estimation of failure in duty to others. Development of a competence standard that assesses the patient's appreciation of their clinical situation (how the risks and benefits of treatment affect their life) in addition to whether they understand their situation is one way to evaluate a depressed patient's refusal of life-saving treatment12. The Japanese Society of General Hospital Psychiatry could develop guidelines that go beyond the legal prerequisites and also help to initiate educational programs in medical school and residencies in order to sensitize young physicians to these issues. The evaluation of psychopathology in the terminally ill and the relationship of that psychopathology to wishes for death are pressing issues for research. The items used in the SAI data base may be helpful in clarifying health care workers' attitudes toward these issues.     <P>  Psychiatrists must also be aware that there are times when psychiatric treatment is not appropriate. The value of treatment of depression should not be over or underestimated; in  some instances it may be best to accept a patient's decision to die12.  Some depressions in the seriously ill may be absolutely treatment resistant, or the burden of serial trials of antidepressants or ECT may be too great in view of the  physical quality of life. These patients should not necessarily loose their right to refuse treatment.      <P> Consciousness raising on the issue of self-determination will be a large task in Japan. The concept of individuality has not taken root well in Japan where relationships are fostered to be, mutually dependent29,30. The cultural attitudes, funerals and other death ceremonies reflect minimal seperation between the dead and the living.  Suicide is not strictly forbidden as it is in western cultures; the death of Buddha was a peaceful transition into Nirvana while that of Christ was suffering31. <P>CONCLUSION     <P>The major results and conclusions are as follows:    <P> 1.)   While up to one-third of psychiatrists expressed some acceptance of suicide in non-terminal cases with functional impairment in social roles/duty to others, more than half did not agree even slightly that commiting suicide could be reasonable in terminal illness with or without major depression.       <P>2.) Over one-third of psychiatrists had some agreement with the statement, "It is valuable to accept a medical patients decision to die even if depressed."    <P>  3.) Physician assisted suicide was approved of most often in cases of terminal illness/nodepression (41%).      <P>4.) Termination of life-support was considered as "letting the patient die naturally" by 62%.      <P> 5.) Psychiatrists with fewer years of experience felt that only rarely or sometimes was distorted thinking or psychopathology involved in medical patients wishes to die and were more likely to rate termination of life support as "letting the patient die naturally".     <P> These results point to an influence on Japanese psychiatrists of the Japanese cultural value of duty and responsibility to others as equal to that of life itself and raise the importance of sensitizing Japanese doctors and legal systems to the relationship of psychopathology with suicidal ideation and to the effect of depression on patient's medical decisions.      <P> Exactly how and if there will be a role for assisted suicide or euthanasia in Japan is an open issue. There is some consensus that these acts go on more often than openly discussed here, usually in the context of a long-standing relationship between physician and a patient and their family. What is "allowed" legally and in public and what is "allowed" in private is often seperated in Japanese culture.    Both the legal and medical communities need to consider at what point should decision making be relegated to the patient and how much of this can be entrusted to the family? Even before issues of self-determination can be considered in medical patients wishing to die, we should note that because only a minority of cancer patients are actually told of their diagnosis, very few of these seriously ill patients can make an informed decision.5 Further study is still needed on the attitudes of psychiatrists from other cultures,  physicians in other subspecialties, the general population, as well as terminal patients and their families both before and after the death of their loved one. <P>References<P>1.

 <hr> <P> DISCUSSION  <P>   Diagnosing psychopathology in medical patients even in the face of "the reality of the situation" is an important task of the general hospital psychiatrist16,18.   A surprising finding in this study was that while the vast majority of psychiatrists agreed that there may be times when suicidal ideation  (91.5%), or completed suicide (78%) in med-surg patients is logical or reasonable, the majority of psychiatrists did not agree even slightly that commiting suicide could be logical or reasonable in terminal illness with major depression irrespective of the  quality of life, or in terminal illness with good quality of life and no major depression. This was despite the fact that 18-32% of psychiatrists had some degree of acceptance of suicide in non-terminal cases with inability to function in various social roles (26% agreeing at least slightly that a murder-suicide could be reasonable), and despite the significant positive relationship of degree of acceptance of suicide as reasonable in non-terminal cases unable to fulfill family duties with rating termination of life support in an incurable non-terminal patient with poor quality of life as a "suicide".   <P>  These results point to an influence on a number of Japanese psychiatrists of the Japanese cultural value of duty and responsibility to others at a level equal to that of life itself, a value seen in the medical setting that can be seen in in other aspects of Japanese culture including intense devotion to one's company even at the expense of one's health (karoshi), suicide in order to take responsibility for something by persons who feel loyal to superiors involved in a scandal (inseki jisatsu), and others9,23,24. Maintenance of the value of duty and responsibility to others in a manner that does not have to call for unnecessary loss of life could be promoted through psychosocial interventions and education of both the general public as well as the medical profession on issues of death and dying.  <P>   These findings also raise the importance of sensitizing Japanese doctors to the need to determine when depression in the terminally ill may affect the decision to forgo life-sustaining medical treatment16-18. While 92% of psychiatrists responded that it is usually or always important to give optimal medical and psychiatric treatment to medical patients who refuse life saving treatment, 25% responded that it may be sometimes, and 10% usually or always, valuable to accept a medical patient's decision to die even if they are depressed. Interestingly, the small group, N=5 who responded that it was only "sometimes" important to give optimal treatment on this item, had significantly greater degrees of agreement on physician assisted suicide in cases of failure in duty to others.  A view of depression in the face of serious illness as reasonable may be a form of "pseudo-empathy" against which psychiatrists should be warned, especially as physicians have been shown to underestimate seriously ill patients' quality of life and their desire for life-sustaining treatment12,28.      @<P>@@ Ganzini et al.16 found that remission of major depression with hopelessness in psychiatric patients increased the preferences of these patients for life-saving treatment, while Chochinov et al.18 and Berger25,26 found that desire for death in med-surg or terminal patients is associated with clinical depression, that this desire for death is often transient, and that improvement in family support and treatment of pain can diminish desire for death.  Because of these findings some authors have even recommended a trial of ECT before accepting a do-not-resuscitate order in patients with affective disorder27. Such findings need to be communicated to the Japanese psychiatric community.   <P>  Interventions that could enhance social support and address high stress levels (family meetings, therapist support); diminish physical distress (medical or surgical interventions); treat depression (psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy); and improve physical and role functioning (physical therapy, interpersonal therapy) are important avenues that psychiatric consultants should explore when faced with med-surg patients with suicidal ideation.

This younger and less experienced group, which was also more likely to rate termination of life support in an incurable non-terminal patient with poor quality of life as "letting the patient die naturally" rather than a"suicide" or a "killing", may not be as sensitive to the relationship of psychopathology to suicidal ideation in this group of patients as their more experienced colleagues.   <P>  Our study has several strengths and several limitations.

Development of a competence standard that assesses the patient's appreciation of their clinical situation (how the risks and benefits of treatment affect their life) in addition to whether they understand their situation is one way to evaluate a depressed patient's refusal of life-saving treatment12. The Japanese Society of General Hospital Psychiatry could develop guidelines that go beyond the legal prerequisites and also help to initiate educational programs in medical school and residencies in order to sensitize young physicians to these issues. The evaluation of psychopathology in the terminally ill and the relationship of that psychopathology to wishes for death are pressing issues for research. The items used in the SAI data base may be helpful in clarifying health care workers' attitudes toward these issues.     <P>  Psychiatrists must also be aware that there are times when psychiatric treatment is not appropriate. The value of treatment of depression should not be over or underestimated; in  some instances it may be best to accept a patient's decision to die12.  Some depressions in the seriously ill may be absolutely treatment resistant, or the burden of serial trials of antidepressants or ECT may be too great in view of the  physical quality of life. These patients should not necessarily loose their right to refuse treatment.      <P> Consciousness raising on the issue of self-determination will be a large task in Japan. The concept of individuality has not taken root well in Japan where relationships are fostered to be, mutually dependent29,30. The cultural attitudes, funerals and other death ceremonies reflect minimal seperation between the dead and the living.  Suicide is not strictly forbidden as it is in western cultures; the death of Buddha was a peaceful transition into Nirvana while that of Christ was suffering31. <P>CONCLUSION     <P>The major results and conclusions are as follows:    <P> 1.)   While up to one-third of psychiatrists expressed some acceptance of suicide in non-terminal cases with functional impairment in social roles/duty to others, more than half did not agree even slightly that commiting suicide could be reasonable in terminal illness with or without major depression.       <P>2.) Over one-third of psychiatrists had some agreement with the statement, "It is valuable to accept a medical patients decision to die even if depressed."    <P>  3.) Physician assisted suicide was approved of most often in cases of terminal illness/nodepression (41%).      <P>4.) Termination of life-support was considered as "letting the patient die naturally" by 62%.      <P> 5.) Psychiatrists with fewer years of experience felt that only rarely or sometimes was distorted thinking or psychopathology involved in medical patients wishes to die and were more likely to rate termination of life support as "letting the patient die naturally".     <P> These results point to an influence on Japanese psychiatrists of the Japanese cultural value of duty and responsibility to others as equal to that of life itself and raise the importance of sensitizing Japanese doctors and legal systems to the relationship of psychopathology with suicidal ideation and to the effect of depression on patient's medical decisions.      <P> Exactly how and if there will be a role for assisted suicide or euthanasia in Japan is an open issue. There is some consensus that these acts go on more often than openly discussed here, usually in the context of a long-standing relationship between physician and a patient and their family. What is "allowed" legally and in public and what is "allowed" in private is often seperated in Japanese culture.    Both the legal and medical communities need to consider at what point should decision making be relegated to the patient and how much of this can be entrusted to the family? Even before issues of self-determination can be considered in medical patients wishing to die, we should note that because only a minority of cancer patients are actually told of their diagnosis, very few of these seriously ill patients can make an informed decision.5 Further study is still needed on the attitudes of psychiatrists from other cultures,  physicians in other subspecialties, the general population, as well as terminal patients and their families both before and after the death of their loved one. <P>References<P>1.

  <P>  FOUR STAGES IN ONE SESSION@  <P>     The "KiShoTenKetsu" concept described above can be aplied to the process of one session which will now be described.  <P>  1. First Stage: "Ki"(introduction)     <P>    In this stage the patient reports what happened since the previous session.  The patient also assesses both the positive and adverse effects of medication.  The clinician helps the paient to clarify the problems and gains, and identifies one or two issues to focus on in the session.  For clarification, it is helpful for the clinician to use common sense.  This does not necessarily mean that their common sense is correct.  However, the descrepancy between the patient's story and the clinician's common sense sheds light on the patient's underlying problems.    <P>     When the clinician discusses a problem they should avoid forcing the patient to accept their viewpoint.  The patient's own wording should be used as much as possible.  Improvement in sleep and appetite are good indicators of change.  <P>  2. Second Stage: "Sho"(development)      <P>   At the second "Sho" stage the clinician and the patient collaboratively try to begin to solve problems from a cognitive point of view, especially the modification of "hard-core" related thoughts and images, which will be described in detail in the third stage.   <P>  Modifying Cognitive Distortions@   <P>    In brief session therapy, thoughts are modified into more flexible and adaptive ones just as they are in standard cognitive therapy.  For this purpose, Socratic questioning and guided discovery are used The importance of wider, flexible thinking has been acknowledged for a long time in Japan as being important for psychological well-being.  A Zen priest Takuan (1573-1648) clearly pointed out this issue.  His idea, which had a big influence on the "Bushido" (the samurai spirit), shares many similar points of view with cognitive theory.        <P>   In his writing he repeatedly underscored the importance of free movement of the mind.  He said that a person cannot see all the leaves if they stand in front of a big tree looking at only one leaf.  This is similar to the case in which one becomes trapped in anguish when their mind looses flexibility and becomes unable to move freely.  He writes, "It is best not to have your mind stop at one point just based on whatever you may see or hear."@    <P>   It is not enough just to understand such ideas intellectually.  It can be utilized only after one acquires practical techniques.  Priest Takuan uderscored this by saying "Even if you see reason, it is useless until you gain command of practical techniques cc Technique and reason are closely connected to each other, like the wheels of a car." The importance of flexible thinking in Zen relates to the heavy burden the Japanese put on themselves through self-survellance. Whereas Westerners identify their observer-selves with their sense of rationality and pride themselves in keeping one's wits in time of crisis, the Japanese feel an incredible relief when they can release the  restraints of self-watchfulness. Zen declares that there is a more efficient plane of human consciousness when this burden falls away (Benedict).@     <P>  The techniques of cognitive therapy identify and modify automatic thoughts and help adaptation to reality.  Focusing on automatic thoughts and images derived from the both "helpless", "unlovable" hard-core schema is important in order to help modify cognitions in a brief session.  A patient will mention them as they discuss issues related to internal or/and external control, or interpersonal relationships.  These shema are  expressed as distorted views of self, others, and the relationships to others.  <P>  Transference Utilization both Inside and Outside the Treatment@  <P>  Clinicians should pay attention to transference because it contains a lot of information related to cognitive distortions.  As mentioned above the clinician should be problem-oriented as well as reality-oriented.  The main focus is on here-and-now issues in order to prevent regression.  Even when the patient's past is discussed, it should be compared with the present.@    <P>   In order to keep sessions short, it is necessary to take up cognitive distortions that occurs outside the session as well.  Regressed patients easily transfer their maladaptive relating styles to others in their outside lives and this causes interpersonal problems and cognitive distortions.  This makes it possible to briefly identify and resolve the patient's maladaptive behaviors and thoughts by modifying cognitive distortions related the "hard-core" schema that occur not only inside, but also outside the treatment.  <P>  Don't Forget the Positive Side  <P>  @   The clinician should not to overlook positive aspects in the patient's life, and these should be supported in the treatment.  Therapists are usually good at pinpointing patients' negative aspects.  Patients are also specialists at reporting negative aspects more negatively.  As a result, the clinician tends to conspire with the patient to find every fault, and this only strengthens the patient's negative cognitions.       <P>  The clinician should look for signs that indicate that the patient is able to control their thoughts, feelings, and/or behavior, or that they are able to communicate with others.  After listning for a while the clinician should verbally strengthen any cognitive restructuring.  Alternatively, the therapist may support the patient nonverbally.       <P>    The clinician should empathize with the patient's distress because, if the patient's positive side is mentioned repeatedly, the patient may become frustrated thinking that the clinician does not apprciate their psychological pain.  In addition, if the clinician says things like "you are always focusing on the negative side because you feel you are inadequate", the patient may feel criticized.  This kind of intervention may only help to enforce the "helpless" and "unlovable" schema.  In order to avoid this, the clinician should try to explain at length what they want to convey by quoting concrete examples and by using the patient's words as much as possible.  If the patient says that they are not getting better, the clinician may say, "Although you say you are not going better, your voice became louder and you said you started walking faster. This seems like you are getting better."@In order to get objective information, questionnaires as the Beck Depression Inventry, Beck Anxiety Inventry, and others can be given as well. @   <P>    The clinician can also use general information regarding symptomatology in order to avoid criticizing the patient, ie., " Mood is generally thought to recover slower than other symptoms are.  So you may be still feeling distressed internally even if you look like you are getting better." or "Generally people tend to recall only the painful events and to focus on the distress.  That is a cognitive distortion as you know.  Do you think this is happening to you?"@     <P>  The clinician may clarify this by quoting some events that everyone can identify with, "You might not be able to see your own changes if you try to find them every day.  This is the same experience of parents.  They do not notice that their children are growing taller because they see them everyday.  Grandparents who see their grandchildren once a year, however, easily notice the growth."       <P>  Sometimes it happens that nothing has changed during a certain period.  In that case the therapist should not be in hurry or become despaired.  The therapist should check themselves and identify any dysfunctional thoughts, ie., " I am powerless", "The patient will be disappointed with me", "my colleagues will be surprized at my inadequacy", etc.  The clinician  and the patient should reassess the patient's life to look for  problems which may have been left out.  It is also often necessary for patients to accept reality as it is.  They have to acknowledge and psychologically integrate the fact that there are problems which cannot be easily resolved and that life can go on with them.  <P>  Dysfunctional Thought Record       <P>  In order to assess both realistic and distorted thinking properly it is useful to recommend patients to keep a Dysfunctional Thought Record as described by Beck (1979).  The clinician, however, should not force this on the patient as the patient often will not follow this (similar to homework for students) and the therapeutic relationship can become strained.       <P>  The main reason to let the patient record thoughts in their own way is that the purpose of the record is not only for the modification of dysfunctional thoughts but also to cultivate problem-solving ability.  Having their own format and using it in their own way allows the patient to experience that their individuality is respected.  This experience will strengthen the motivation to participate in treatment and enhance patients' self-reliance.@    <P>   During this procedure the clinician should not focus only on negative aspects as has been previously pointed out.  The way Morita-therapists handle a patient's diary is a good example (Fujita, 1986).  In Morita therapy, the patient is thought to be unable to get out of distress because they are obsessively fixated on their symptoms or daily problems.  Because these symptoms and problems often cannot easily be ameliorated, the patient is encouraged to accept the difficulties as they are, and to do whatever they can little by little.  In order to foster this, the clinician intentionally neglects patients' complaints about their difficulties and instead focuses on the areas where they have dealt well with their difficulties.       <P>   It is important for the clinician to determine what will be communicated to the patient because it is not therapeutically appropriate to convey everything.  Patients may sense that the therapist is benevolent by this and this allows the patient to see that they are accepted and cared for even when it is not directly verbally expressed.  <P>  Reorganizing Daily Activities      <P>   The life of psychiatric patients is usually disturbed.  A large number of patients report that they are withdrawn from social activities.  This tendency is usually more prominent in chronic patients.  This can function as a factor to maintain or worsen symptoms and a vicious cycle may develop.  In order to interrupt this vicious cycle and to reorganize daily activities, the patient is advised to plan a daily schedule.  Assessing degree of pleasure and life satisfaction is important in cognitive therapy.  The patient should be helped to become able to have a sense of fulfillment in their activities such as job, housework, study, etc.  <P>  3.Third Stage: "Ten" (turn)        <P>  In the third "Ten" stage the "hard-core" schema is the main focus.   Although it is difficult to clearly divide the second and third stages.  They can be differentiated based on which parts, the automatic thoughts or the schema, are the main focus.  The task here is to modify the "hard-core" schema based on an understanding of the repeating themes in the automatic thoughts.  In earlier sessions the second stage is longer and in an later sessions the third stage becomes longer.      <P>   Clinical interventions become more acceptable to the patient if the clinician uses the patient's own description of their personality assessing the "hard-core" schema.  In the "Ten" stage the patient is helped to realize that it is unrealistic to think that they should be able to do everything or, conversely, that they cannot do anything.  Patients need to acknowldge that it is natural for them to be cared for by someone but that they cannot get this from everyone.  During this process it is useful to keep the long-term goals in mind.  <P>  4.Fourth Stage: "Ketsu"(termination)      <P>   In the final "Ketsu" phase the patient's feedback is gotten, homework is assigned, and medication is prescribed if needed.  The homework assignment is important in order to shorten the session, to modify cognitive distortions through actual practice, and to understand transferences in daily life.  <P>  CASE EXAMPLES  <P>  1. Develop Patient's Own Daily Schedule@   <P>    A fourty-two year old Japanese male college professor was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder, type II.  He was severely depressed with sleep disturbance.  After several sessions, he developed a daily schedule that graphically recorded his work, leisure, sleep, life events, medication, mood changes, etc.  In this way he tried to control his daily life visually.  Although the descriptions were detailed (which reflected his obsessionality) the clinician did not confront this because it was not interfering with his activity.  The therapist respected the patient's coping style as his way of controling his internal and external life, and together with the patient made a plan for the following week's activities, expecting that his helpless schema would improve.  Partly helped by this procedure his depression lifted.  <P>  2. Developing a Sense to be Loved     <P>  @A fifty-eight year-old single Japanese female was seen for obsessive behavior, impulsive shoplifting, and depressed mood with suicidal ideation which had lasted for more than 30 years.  Because she was hard of hearing and had no relatives, she talked only to her supervisor at work and a nun at a small convent to which she had belonged for several years.  She started writing down events and thoughts during the previous week in tiny handwriting on a small memopad.  She always read them aloud as if she was asking for the clinician's approval.  Her detailed descriptions reflected her obsessive and dependent style.    <P>       At the same time, she tried to teach the clinician by including a quoted passage from a novel or essay in her memos.  Although the clinician thought that the patient was trying to deny her dependency on him by this, it was not interpreted.  He understood it as the patient's way to control the treatment situation and, at the same time, to communicate with him by giving information.  The clinician expected that these efforts would result in the modification of her "helpless" and "unlovable" schemas.  This expectation was supported by the fact that the patient functioned well with few symptoms and attended the clinic every other week for a fifteen minute session where she mostly read and the clinician made a few comments.  <P>  3. Helping to develop a sense of control@    <P>   A thirty-two old single Japanese male was diagnosed as having major depression for eleven years.  He complained of severe lethergy and loss of interest.  In the third session he said, "I have gradually become able to keep a diary about my feelings and thoughts though It has been very difficult for me to even write down a memo.  I have also become able to clean my desk.  I am now trying to do whatever I can."        <P>  The therapist said, "You seem to have regained a sense of control by doing daily trivial things.  I think it is a good way to make you feel good."  The patient added, "I will suffer a setback if I am confronted by a big wave of difficulty."  The  therapist clarified that this reaction is his usual attitude to see the future in a negative way, and clarified that he often challenges big difficult tasks when he feels good, and usually fails with following through on them.  Then the therapist pointed out that these experiences make him feel like a failure and exacerbate his depression.  The patient agreed with this interpretation and started developing a daily schedule.   <P>  TOWARD TERMINATION OF TREATMENT    <P>     Once the "hard-core" schemas have been modified and the patient becomes more confident, they should be able to have more meaningful interactions with others.  At this point the patient is ready to seperate from the clinician without much difficulty.  At termination, patients are told that they can come back whenever necessary.  In Japan, where a strict appointment system has not been established, the patient can easily return to the therapist any time.   This situation fosters the feeling in the patient's mind that they are supported.  It is interesting that oriental culture has symbolized human interdependency in the Chinese character "l" (human being) in which two lines can be seen supporting each other.     <P>    Some patients may become over-dependent due to this system.  Overdependency can be avoided by respecting the patient's individuality and deciding on termination together with the patient, basing the decision on improvement in the patient's daily activities.  <P>  CONCLUSION       <P>  Recent findings suggest that pharmachotherapy can ameliorate not only symptoms but also problematic behavior.  The authors believe, however, that it is difficult to modify underlying shchema only by medication.  In order to modify these schemas to the degree to prevent relapse, psychotherapeutic approaches are often required.     @  <P>  It is becoming more and more difficult to be able to spend fourty-five or fifty minutes per session, and furthermore, full-time sessions may not be necessary for all patients.  Frances, Clarkin, and Perry (1984) pointed out that the theory and research supporting the 50-minute hour were not very convincing.  There are, of course, patients who will require longer-session psychotherapy such as psyhoanalytic psychotherapy or cognitive therapy.  Such psychotherapy also plays an important role in training in order to understand psychodynamic and therapeutic processes.@     <P>  In Japan many patients seem to benefit from a brief session cognitive approach of approximately fifteen minutes per session. Shortening the treatment session not only improves the cost performance but also prevents malignant regression.  This is true even for these patients who develop a network approach of multiple specialists and relatives to support him/her.@  <P>     It is certainly difficult to deal with the entirety of a patient's psychological problems in a brief session.  This approach can help a patient to change by providing them with a sense of fulfillment in that they had identified and resolved their problems by themselves and through the experience of sharing communication with another person they were able to grow.  These experiences strengthen ones sense of control and cultivate self-confidence which can then modify the "hard-core" schema.      <P>    It has to be underscored that these approaches have been develpoed based on clinical experience in Japan. These techniques could, however, be modified for patients with different socio-cultural backgrounds, as Freud (1958) recomended modifying therapeutic style to the individual personality of the treatment.      <P>   Japanese are said to be emotionally less expressive, often use nonverbal communications, and tend to accept interdependency over individuation as described in the "Amae" concept by Doi (1973).  These factors will color the way Japanese therapists approach psychotherapy with Japanese and are part of the reason why cognitive therapy may be more useful than exprressive therapies in Japan.  It is especially interesting that the idea of the Zen priest Takuan and the concept of cognitive therapy share common viewpoints. This may be another reason why cognitive therapy is easily adaptable to Japanese patients.     <P>    It is also encouraging that the authors' technique of focusing on the "triple C" developed in Japan can be integrated with Beck's "hard-core" schema concept.  This suggests that the "hard-core" shema concept may be a universally basic theoretical framework.  It is also possible to shorten the therapy session by utilizing this concept even with patients of a different sociocultural background.  While brief session cognitve approach seems promising, these clinical impressions remain to be systematically studied.  <P>  REFERENCES  <P>  1.

King & Spalding is a growing Firm with on-going employment opportunities. The Firm interviews second year law students in the fall to participate in the summer associate program. In addition, the Firm seeks to hire qualified third year law students and judicial clerks to start at the Firm in the fall of 1997. The Firm is also looking for lateral hires with current needs in the following areas: banking and finance; corporate; product liability; real estate; environmental; public finance; tax; trust and estates; contracting, construction and procurement; and healthcare. <P>
<H3><A NAME="Intro">Introduction</A></H3><P>
King & Spalding is a Firm of over 350 lawyers with its principal office in Atlanta, home of the 1996 Olympic Centennial Games. Over its 110-year life, King & Spalding has enjoyed prosperity and stability rivaled by few other U.S. law Firms. With additional offices in New York, Washington and Houston, King & Spalding is able to offer its lawyers a sophisticated practice of national and international scope, while maintaining a high degree of collegiality and institutional loyalty.<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="H&C">History and Composition</A></H3><P>
<P>
King & Spalding was founded on January 1, 1885 by Alex C. King and Jack J. Spalding. Mr. King later became Solicitor General of the United States and a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Judge Griffin B. Bell returned to the Firm in 1979 after having served as Attorney General of the United States and as a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Many of the Firm's lawyers have held distinguished positions in the American Bar Association, the State Bar of Georgia (including four presidents), and other professional and civic organizations. The Firm encourages individual lawyers to participate in professional, civic, charitable and pro bono activities of their choice. <P>
The Firm has experienced significant growth over the years as a result of the tremendous growth in Atlanta and the Southeast and our ever-increasing national and international presence. As of September 1996, the Firm has 388 lawyers (219 associates, 141 partners, and 28 lawyers who serve as counsel or senior attorneys to the Firm). Associates come from 36 states, 6 foreign countries and 69 law schools. King & Spalding recruits nationally, and 44 percent of the Firm's associates are from outside the Southeast. 36 new associates joined the Firm in September, 1996. The Firm employs 85 paralegals who assist attorneys in all areas of the Firm's practice.<P>
King & Spalding's Atlanta offices are located at 191 Peachtree Street, a landmark office tower located in the heart of downtown Atlanta. This new building is located within easy walking distance of the hub of MARTA (the City's rapid rail system), Georgia State University and Olympic Centennial Park. King & Spalding is located on the top eleven floors of the building. Our office features state of the art technology, legal support systems and a top-floor lawyer dining room and conference center and will expand to an additional floor in 1997.<P>
The Firm opened a Washington, D.C. office in 1979. The Washington office presently has 64 full-time lawyers with an active practice in the areas of tax, food and drug, governmental affairs, antitrust, litigation, white collar crime, commercial banking, international trade, and environmental law.<P>
In 1990, King & Spalding established a small office in New York which has grown to 40 lawyers practicing in the areas of banking and finance, domestic and international taxation, project finance, workouts, bankruptcies and creditors rights, corporate finance and acquisitions, energy and independent power, real estate, commercial litigation, international transactions and special matters.<P>
King & Spalding opened its office in Houston, Texas in early 1995. The decision to establish an office in Houston resulted from our commitment to serve the needs of our existing clients. The recent growth and diversification of the economy in Houston have created an attractive market for our newest office. Our Houston office presently has 8 full time attorneys concentrating their practice in commercial litigation.<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Practice">Practice</A></H3>
<P>
King & Spalding is engaged in the general practice of law and is organized around 23 specific practice areas. These practice areas are identified as follows: antitrust and trade regulation; banking and finance; bankruptcy; commercial litigation; construction and development; corporate; energy and independent power; environmental; food and drug; governmental; healthcare; intellectual property and technology; international; international trade regulation and customs; labor, ERISA and employment law; product liability; project finance; public finance; real estate; special matters; tax/domestic and international; toxic tort; and trust and estates.<P>
In Atlanta and the Southeast, King & Spalding serves a preeminently strong base of clients for which it acts as general or special counsel. These clients include some of the leading Fortune 500 companies in Atlanta, the Southeast and the nation. In the past decade, the Firm has also assumed a steadily expanding role in its representation of many multinational businesses in their affairs both in the United States and internationally. The Firm's dynamic and broad-based client base provides a challenging work experience. The Firm also represents many other clients less known to the general public, including emerging "high-tech" businesses and numerous charitable, educational and healthcare institutions. The Firm's client base is extremely diverse, and no single client or specialized type of practice accounts for a substantial portion of the Firm's practice.<P>
The Firm has served as general counsel to the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Centennial Games, which was charged with the responsibility of organizing and conducting the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Three of our partners were part of the "Atlanta nine" that spearheaded the effort to bring the games to Atlanta. The Firm assisted in all aspects of the Games, including legal services relating to the world wide television rights, merchandising and other licensing agreements, sponsorship contracts, site acquisition and leasing, venue construction contracts, trademark issues, etc. <P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="AD&T">Associate Development and Training</A></H3>
<P>
The Firm expects to hire approximately 50 new associates in 1997, with approximately 40 to be located in Atlanta. Associates are assigned to specific practice areas upon their arrival at the Firm, and every effort is made to accommodate personal preferences and Firm practice needs. For administrative purposes, the Firm is divided into 19 teams, with some teams managing several broad areas of practice. Team leaders are responsible for work load, assignment of new matters and planning for their teams. The Firm conducts an intensive orientation and training program for all new associates shortly following their arrival. <P>
The nature of King & Spalding's practice provides the opportunity for associates to have significant client contact and responsibility early in their career. Many matters involve attorneys from numerous areas of the Firm's practice and require a team effort. <P>King & Spalding enjoys a rich history of community involvement and public service. This widespread, significant involvement of King & Spalding lawyers in community service and public interest activities provides a ready avenue for interested associates to get involved. King & Spalding also supports public interest law internships with NAPIL as a Public Service Challenge Benefactor.  The Firm has also been involved in numerous pro bono matters, including Habitat for Humanity home closings, Saturday Lawyer Program and significant litigation.<P>
<H3><A NAME="C&B">Compensation and Benefits</A></H3><P>
The starting salary for new associates in 1996 is $67,000 in Atlanta and Houston, $72,000 in Washington, D.C. and $82,000 in New York. The Firm advances up to $5,000 of the starting salary in May before the associate begins work. The Firm also provides group life and medical insurance (with two HMO options), dental insurance and disability insurance. The Firm has a maternity leave policy and Pretax Flexible Spending Accounts. Associates may participate in a voluntary 401(k) plan to which the Firm does not contribute, but through which associates can build retirement savings on a tax efficient basis. Associates are eligible to participate in the plan as of the first January 1 or July 1 following completion of one year of service with the Firm. The Firm pays associates' moving expenses, professional fees and dues and continuing legal education expenses.<P>
<H3><A NAME="SAP">Summer Associate Program</A></H3><P>
The Firm plans to employ approximately 65 summer associates for the 1997 program, with approximately 55 in Atlanta. The 1996 summer program included 54 summer associates representing 21 law schools. The summer associate program is important to the Firm's hiring efforts and provides a substantial number of the new associates hired each year. The number of summer associates hired by the Firm is based on the projected needs of the Firm, and the Firm does not hire more summer associates than necessary to meet these projected needs. Therefore, the Firm has a very high offer rate to summer associates, and the percentage of offers made to each summer class has averaged approximately 95% during the last five years. <P>
Summer associates rotate through several of the Firm's practice groups and are encouraged to meet and work with as many lawyers as possible. The Firm assigns an advisor to each summer associate to help ensure that the summer experience is professionally rewarding and enjoyable. The Firm actively encourages summer associates to experience the city and area and to take time to appreciate and enjoy the fine quality of life available in these cities. <P>
For students interested in public service work, King & Spalding has adopted a policy of sponsoring second half public service clerkships for any summer associate who spends the first half of the summer with the Firm and the second half with an approved public interest internship or pro bono activity. During the summer of 1996, nine summer associates took advantage of this program.<P>
The Firm permits students to split their summers with other Firms. The Atlanta office requires that these students spend the first half of the summer at the Firm and stay at least six weeks. In 1996, summer associates received a weekly salary of $1,075 in Atlanta and Houston and $1,250 in Washington.<P>
<H3><A NAME="PHC">Preferred Hiring Criteria</A></H3><P>
Candidates must offer high academic achievement; should have demonstrated the ability to excel in related academic areas such as law review, moot court, etc.; and have established a record of achievement or leadership in extra-curricular activities.<P>
<H3><A NAME="EO">Employment Opportunity</A></H3><P>
The Firm hopes to hire approximately 65 summer associates, with approximately 55 in Atlanta. The summer program is limited to second year law students and third year law students who participate after graduation and prior to starting a judicial clerkship. The Firm also hopes to hire numerous third year law students and judicial clerks to start in the fall of 1997. Therefore, the Firm is interested in interviewing well-qualified applicants for these openings. <P>
King & Spalding is committed to a policy of equal employment opportunity. The Firm will not discriminate in any aspect of its employment practice against any qualified applicant or employee on account of race, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, marital status, or Vietnam-era or other veteran status.<P>

<STRONG>Intellectual Property & Technology Rights</STRONG>.

<P>
<STRONG>Telecommunications</STRONG>.  King & Spalding has substantial experience in telecommunications transactions.

The Firm represented another major telecommunications provider in the acquisition of its interest in a high capacity transatlantic fiber optic cable and in the formation of a worldwide telecommunications marketing alliance.
<P>
<STRONG>Communications Law</STRONG>.  The Firm also represents various broadcast and print media interests in transactions and disputes concerning news access, programming rights, piracy, and libel and privacy claims.

Lawyers in the IPT Group in the Washington office have represented clients before the Federal Communications Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Trade Representative, and the State Department's Bureau of International Communications and Information Policy.

<STRONG>Litigation</STRONG>.  The IPT Practice includes the litigation of intellectual property disputes involving patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other claims of unfair competition.  Lawyers in this Group have represented corporations in major patent infringement actions both in federal courts and before the U.S. International Trade Commission. Lawyers have handled a wide variety of litigated trademark, trade dress, copyright and product counterfeiting matters. This Group also handles contested opposition and cancellation trademark proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

<h1>International Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
	The international legal work of King & Spalding is a substantial and rapidly-expanding part of its overall practice. In addition to representing U.S. clients in a wide variety of undertakings outside the United States, the Firm represents numerous non-U.S. clients as to their U.S. legal affairs.  These clients include companies, government agencies and natural persons from throughout the world.
<P>
	<STRONG>Foreign Investment in the United States</STRONG>.  King & Spalding advises a large number of private and institutional foreign investors as to various types of investments throughout the United States. The Firm has represented foreign clients in acquisitions of numerous U.S. corporations and has done a significant amount of work in structuring funds for foreign investment in the United States. The Firm also does a substantial amount of international licensing, distribution and franchising work.
<P>
	<STRONG>U.S. Investment Abroad</STRONG>.  King & Spalding advises a growing number of U.S. clients with respect to their overseas investments and business activities. The Firm has been involved in a wide variety of international corporate, commercial and financial transactions for such clients, including structuring, negotiating and effecting international joint ventures and strategic alliances, cross border acquisitions, international license, distribution and franchising arrangements and international financial arrangements including "double-dip" lease transactions and other tax-advantaged financings.
<P>
	The Firm has particular experience in accessing finance and political risk insurance support from international financial institutions such as the International Finance Corporation, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and U.S. Eximbank. A number of the Firm's partners have long-standing experience with European business transactions, and three of its partners were born in Europe and received their original legal training there. Recently the Firm has become increasingly active in business transactions for U.S. clients in the Far East, Latin America and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Firm has been particularly active in China, where it has assisted U.S. companies in the establishment of business operations since the late 1970s.
<P>
	<STRONG>International Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances</STRONG>.  King & Spalding has a substantial practice involving international joint ventures and strategic alliances. This representation includes assistance in the creation of large telecommunications joint ventures in Europe, Latin America and the Far East. The Firm recently assisted a client in the establishment of China s first joint venture for the manufacture of cable television equipment.
<P>
	<STRONG>International Investment Funds</STRONG>.  King & Spalding has extensive experience in representing sponsors of international investment funds, including funds offered privately to non-U.S. investors for investment in the United States and funds offered privately to U.S. investors for investment outside the United States. Such funds have invested in venture capital situations, leveraged buyouts, publicly and privately traded securities portfolios, and real estate. The Firm s fund sponsor clients have included German merchant banks, Dutch real estate and venture capital fund sponsors and managers, a consortium of European venture capitalists and several Kuwaiti merchant and investment banks, as well as U.S. investment banks.
<P>
	<STRONG>International Finance Practice</STRONG>.  The 1992 merger into King & Spalding of the New York firm of Porter & Travers significantly enhanced King & Spalding s international financing capabilities with the addition of an established, integrated practice group having an industry-wide reputation in the areas of complex structured financing transactions and the development of new financial products. The New York-based group has substantial experience in cross-border financings of all types, including, in particular, project financings, LDC debt swaps, debt repurchase transactions and trade finance. The group s clients include numerous non-U.S. banks.
<P>
	In particular, the financing partners in the New York office are recognized as being among the leaders in the development of the project finance model successfully utilized by the cogeneration, independent power and alternate-energy industries. The group s work in this area, combined with its extensive international experience, has led to an expanding practice advising both U.S. and non-U.S. developers in the development of infrastructure and other projects overseas, as well as advising governmental agencies in their privatization initiatives.
<P>
	<STRONG>International Trade Regulation and Customs Practice</STRONG>.  Lawyers in this practice handle a broad range of international trade regulatory and legislative matters. They practice before the U.S. Congress, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. International Trade Commission, the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Court of International Trade, and various other governmental and administrative bodies.  Together, they have extensive experience in antidumping, countervailing duty, and other international trade and customs matters.
<P>
	King & Spalding's trade lawyers are part of the Firm's Litigation Group and have broad experience in civil litigation. They are trained in developing the factual record and legal theories that are most likely to result in a favorable outcome to the client. This litigation experience, not shared by many trade lawyers, gives the Firm an advantage in handling trade remedy litigation before the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce.
<P>
<STRONG>Kuwaiti Practice</STRONG>.  King & Spalding has a substantial practice involving representation of Kuwaiti institutions and individuals as to their investments and other affairs in the United States and advises a number of U.S. clients with respect to their business activities in Kuwait. 
<P>
	<STRONG>Tax Aspects of the International Practice</STRONG>.  Lawyers involved in the Firm s International Practice frequently focus on international legal and tax planning and the establishment of multinational tax and legal structures. Lawyers from the Firm s Tax Department are often involved in the tax aspects of such international transactions.
<P>
	<STRONG>Political Emergency Protective Structures.</STRONG>  Lawyers in the Firm have worked extensively on "failsafe" legal structures aimed at protecting U.S. and other international investments of foreign clients against the adverse effects of possible political emergencies in their home countries and against the adverse effects of actions the U.S. Government might take under the Trading with the Enemy Act and related laws. The Firm has worked on such protective structures for a variety of clients, including non-U.S. families and private and publicly-owned European and Middle Eastern companies.
<P>
<STRONG>1996 Olympics</STRONG>.  King & Spalding is general counsel for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games ("ACOG"), the legal entity that will conduct the 1996 Summer Olympics.

<h1>International Trade Regulation &amp; Customs Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
The International Trade Regulation and Customs Practice Group, headquartered in the Firm's Washington, D.C. office, handles a broad range of international trade regulatory and customs matters.  Lawyers in the Group practice before the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. International Trade Commission, the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Court of International Trade, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, NAFTA binational panels,  and various other governmental and administrative bodies.  The lawyers in this Group have experience in antidumping and countervailing duty cases, GATT, NAFTA, export controls, and other international trade and customs matters.  <p>

King &amp; Spalding's trade lawyers constitute a subsection of the Firm's Litigation Group and have broad experience in civil litigation.  The Group is experienced in handling trade remedy litigation before the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce and in litigating
customs disputes before the U.S. Court of International Trade.<p>

The Group has won antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from Mexico, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Canada, Venezuela and the People's Republic of China.  For example, in recent years the Group won two antidumping cases on behalf of U.S. cement producers, an industry which had lost antidumping cases in 1976, 1978, 1983 and 1986.  Antidumping duties averaging 58 percent were entered against cement imports from Mexico, and antidumping duties averaging 64 percent were entered against cement imports from Japan.  A third cement antidumping case was successfully resolved by a "suspension agreement," under which Venezuelan cement producers agreed to revise their pricing to eliminate sales at less than fair value.  As a result of these cases, cement imports from Mexico, Japan and Venezuela dropped 84 percent from their 1988 peak to 1994, and the U.S. cement industry is enjoying greater output and higher prices.<p>

<h1>Investment Fund Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King & Spalding has had extensive experience in representing numerous sponsors and underwriters of both on-shore and off-shore investment funds, including funds offered publicly and privately in the United States to U.S. investors, and funds offered outside the United States to non-U.S. investors. The investment goals of such funds have included investing in venture capital situations, middle-market companies, publicly and privately traded securities portfolios, emerging market debt and equity assets, real estate, and the securities of financially troubled companies. Certain funds have focused on specific industries, such as cable television and theatrical and television film productions. 
<P>
The Firm's fund sponsor clients have included U.S. investment banks and U.S. venture capital fund sponsors/managers, U.S. insurance companies, Dutch real estate and venture capital fund sponsors/managers, German merchant banks and venture capital fund sponsors/managers, a consortium of European venture capitalists and two Kuwaiti merchant banks. The Firm also counsels fund investment advisors.
<P>
As one example of a fund organized by King & Spalding, when two prominent general partners of a New York-based investment banking firm decided to resign their partnerships, form their own merchant bank and establish funds for investment in corporate turnaround situations, they looked to King & Spalding for the legal and tax work involved. Their first fund raised approximately $180 million of capital. As another example, King & Spalding recently represented a Kuwaiti Islamic bank in organizing the bank's first U.S. real estate fund. The fund will operate in accordance with Islamic principles and has invested approximately $50 million thus far. King & Spalding has represented numerous other fund sponsors with regard to proposed funds.
<P>
King & Spalding also has had experience in organizing and representing funds that invest in the debt and equity assets of specific countries and regions. For example, the Firm organized on behalf of a large bank an open-ended fund that invests in Mexican debt instruments. The Firm is currently organizing a $60 to $80 million fund that will invest in Central and Eastern Europe and two funds aimed at investing a total of approximately $150 million in South Africa. Several of such funds will utilize investment guaranties provided by the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
<P>
In representing a fund sponsor, the Firm typically structures and organizes the legal entity that will serve as the fund vehicle, taking into account tax, operational and other considerations. The Firm also consults with the fund sponsor concerning the various business issues involved in establishing the fund, such as devising the management and incentive fees or other compensation to be paid to the fund manager and determining the kind of preference returns, if any, to be paid to fund investors.
<P>
In addition, the Firm typically advises the fund sponsor on legal issues that may arise in connection with the organization and offering of the fund. Such issues usually include determining where to organize the fund vehicle, resolving any U.S. Investment Company Act issues raised by the offering, assuring compliance with U.S. and other securities laws applicable to the offering, dealing with all disclosure and other issues that arise in preparing the prospectus or placement memorandum for the fund, and determining how to minimize the overall tax burden on the fund and its intended investors. To the extent a fund anticipates attracting significant investment by U.S. pension funds, complex ERISA issues may also need to be addressed.
<P>
With respect to cross-border funds in which certain of the fund investors may be situated outside the United States, King & Spalding offers additional services. King & Spalding typically acts as the "lead firm" in coordinating all U.S. and non-U.S. advisors, in preparing the necessary documentation for the fund, in coordinating the offering to a successful closing and in effecting investment and disposition transactions thereafter. Such funds generally are not registered under the U.S. securities laws. Interests in such funds are sold outside the United States without registration pursuant to Regulation S.

<h1>Biotechnology Practice</h1>
<P><HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King & Spalding's lawyers, and particularly those practicing in the Food and Drug, Intellectual Property, and Environmental Practice Areas have substantial experience handling issues unique to the biotechnology industry.
<P>
The Firm's clients in the Food and Drug, Intellectual Property, and Environmental Practice Areas include trade associations and companies of all sizes representing every segment of industry regulated by federal and state governments, including foods, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, medical devices, industrial and agricultural chemicals, and cosmetics.  The Firm's lawyers handle the full range of regulatory matters, including product approval matters; counseling on compliance with agency requirements; representation before government agencies on enforcement, policy, and rulemaking issues; administrative hearings; debarment actions; litigation, including patent litigation; and legislative matters.
<P>
With its broad regulatory practice, the Firm's Washington, D.C. office has the unique capability to respond to the full range of issues confronting biotechnology companies, and has counseled clients on matters involving the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Customs Service, and other governmental agencies in the United States and abroad.
<P>
The Firm's lawyers, several of whom have handled biotech and biotech-related issues as senior officials at federal agencies, are experienced in dealing in particular with FDA, EPA and USDA in securing marketing authorizations for regulated products of biotechnology.  Partners involved in our Biotechnology Practice have written and spoken extensively on the subject of genetic engineering in the United States and abroad, and have extensive experience in risk assessment techniques applied by the major regulatory agencies.  Our experience allows us to provide assistance in all areas to clients who are attempting to move from the regulation phase into the marketplace.
<P>
In addition to genetically engineered pharmaceuticals, enzymes and diagnostics for use in the human health field, regulated products include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>foods and food additives; 
<LI>plants and plant pesticides;
<LI>microbials with diverse applications (e.g., agricultural, industrial, pollution control); and
<LI>veterinary pharmaceuticals.
</UL>

<P>
The Firm also advises clients on the NIH Recombinant DNA Guidelines and other federal provisions related to contained experiments and field trials involving recombinant organisms.
<P>
King & Spalding routinely advises manufacturers, researchers, and trade associations on issues pertaining to product development; access to expert review and consultation; federal, state and international regulatory requirements; submission of appropriate marketing authorization applications; and legislative affairs.  For example, in the area of plants and plant pesticides, King & Spalding attorneys have experience in dealing with USDA officials on Plant Pest Act issues, securing experimental use permits and subsequent registrations and tolerances from EPA on pesticides and plant pesticides, and negotiating with FDA on the array of food adulteration, "GRAS," food additive and labeling issues that accompany the potential marketing of food products of recombinant DNA technology.
<P>
King and Spalding's Food and Drug, Intellectual Property, and Environmental lawyers can draw as necessary on the full resources of the Firm.  King & Spalding has one of the largest Litigation Departments in the country, with substantial experience in product liability and health and safety-related matters, including toxic torts.  The Firm also has well-established groups of lawyers active in the healthcare, patent, trademark, tax, antitrust, real estate, public and commercial financing, and general corporate areas of practice, and does substantial corporate merger and acquisition work.
<P>
The Firm is uniquely qualified to assist start-up and early-development companies in obtaining regulatory approval and financing in order to develop products and services for the marketplace, while at the same time protecting and enhancing their intellectual property rights.

<h1>Islamic Finance & Investment Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King & Spalding lawyers have for a number of years advised on, structured and implemented finance and investment transactions intended to comply with Islamic principles. In recognition of the continued growth of Islamic financial institutions and their specialized legal needs, the Firm has formed a multi-disciplinary group focusing on this emerging practice area.
<P>
The Islamic Finance and Investment Practice Group brings together those lawyers in the Firm whose experience is frequently called on in Islamic transactions, such as banking and finance, corporate, taxation and real estate. The Practice Group also includes an attorney with extensive experience in Islamic financial law. Lawyers in the Practice Group have experience with Islamic banking, finance and investment transactions.  Lawyers in the Practice Group are based in three of the Firm's offices and include: 
<P>
<STRONG>Atlanta</STRONG>:  Corporate partners Don Knight and Jack Capers, real estate partner Scott Arnold and tax partner Suzanne Feese have been instrumental in advising the Firm's Islamic institutional and private clients on the structuring and implementation of their real estate, securities and corporate investments throughout the United States. Mr. Knight is the author of <EM>Structuring Foreign Investment in U.S. Real Estate </EM>(second edition co-authored by Professor Richard Doernberg of the Emory University Law School), which is considered to be the leading treatise on its subject.  Mr. Capers is the administrative head of the Firm's practice in the Middle East and focuses in representing the Firm's non-U.S. clients as to their activities in the United States involving corporate and securities transactions. Mr. Arnold represents clients with respect to transactions involving U.S. real estate, including non-U.S. clients with substantial direct and indirect investments in U.S. real estate. Ms. Feese has significant experience in designing equity, leasing and other financing and investment structures that are U.S. tax efficient and comply with Islamic Shari'a principles.
<P>
<STRONG>New York</STRONG>:  Banking and Finance partner Isam Salah, President of the Arab Bankers Association of North America, has been involved in numerous Islamic banking transactions, representing both Islamic institutions and intermediary banks. Mansoor Khan, most recently a visiting researcher with the joint Harvard Law School/Harvard Business School project on Islamic investment products, has also consulted with various Islamic institutions on the development of such products. Mr. Khan has held a research internship with the legal department of the IMF during which he focused on the modernization of the Pakistani banking system in line with Islamic banking practices.
<P>
<STRONG>Washington, D.C.</STRONG>:  Tax partner Hap Shashy, formerly Chief Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service, has advised on the U.S. tax implications of various Islamic transactions. 
<P>
Most recently, members of the Group have been called on to advise on the development of new investment structures (including a U.S. tax-favored fund for investment in U.S. real estate), investment instruments acceptable to Islamic financial institutions and Islamically-acceptable U.S. real estate financing methods. The Firm's experience with project financing and international financial institutions has also resulted in the Practice Group being called on to develop project financing models that would combine Islamic funding with funding available from Western commercial sources and international financial institutions.

<H1>Communications Practice</H1></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>King &amp; Spalding has extensive experience representing companies in
communications and communications-related industries, including both carriers
and content providers.  The Firm's lawyers have provided a broad array of
corporate, securities, regulatory and litigation advice to clients engaged in a
range of communications markets, including:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Broadcast Companies
</LI>
<LI>CATV Companies
</LI>
<LI>Interexchange Companies
</LI>
<LI>Local Exchange Carriers
</LI>
<LI>Communications Equipment Suppliers
</LI>
<LI>Global Network Services Providers
</LI></UL>
<P>The enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 will make the
communications markets increasingly competitive.  As existing market
participants expand to new markets and new ventures and technologies seek to
compete in those markets, King &amp; Spalding can respond to the full range of
legal, regulatory, business and strategic planning issues confronting firms in
the new global communications environment.
</P>
<P>	Lawyers in King &amp; Spalding's Atlanta and Washington, D.C. offices are
experienced at handling a broad range of communications-related issues,
including the representation of communications companies before state and
federal regulatory bodies. One of the Firm's partners is a former Assistant
Chief of the Communications and Finance Section of the Antitrust Department at
the United States Department of Justice.  The Firm's Antitrust Practice, in
particular, is adept at securing the necessary regulatory approvals for the
implementation of communications-related mergers, acquisitions and joint
ventures.  The Firm was recently instrumental in obtaining regulatory clearances
in both the United States and the European Union for the launch of a major
global telecommunications joint venture.
</P>
<P>	King &amp; Spalding's lawyers in the communications area can also draw on
the full resources of the Firm to assist its communications clients with
important tax planning and strategic issues.  For example, King &amp; Spalding
is acknowledged as having one of the preeminent Tax Practices in matters of
partnership taxation.  This capability is valuable to communications clients as
the communications industry responds to regulatory and market changes through
the formation of complex alliances, joint ventures and other partnering
arrangements.  In addition, the Governmental Affairs Group at King &amp;
Spalding closely follows legislative developments in the telecommunications area
and can keep clients apprised of the latest developments, as well as offering
the Firm's communications clients the opportunity to have timely input into the
process.
</P>
<P>	King &amp; Spalding's Litigation Department has substantial experience in
handling complex business, patent and antitrust litigation.  The Firm recently
provided litigation representation to a large telecommunications carrier, and
provided subsequent structuring advice in connection with the proper legal
status and characterization of the client's billing and collection arrangements
to other telecommunications providers serviced by the client.
</P>
<P>	The Firm also has broad experience in representing companies involved in
creating and licensing programming content, and in representing communications
related clients in trademark, intellectual property, marketing, radio and
television broadcast matters and trade regulation.  For example, since 1990, the
Firm has represented the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, Inc. (&quot;ACOG&quot;),
the organizing committee for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, and Atlanta
Centennial Olympic Properties, ACOG's marketing joint venture with the United
States Olympic Committee.

<h1>Labor, ERISA &amp; Employment Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King &amp; Spalding represents employers in labor relations, equal employment
opportunity ("EEO"), ERISA, and other employment related matters.  The Firm's labor, ERISA and employment law activities are handled primarily by sixteen attorneys, three ERISA coordinators, and three experienced paralegals.  <p>

This Group represents employers directly in their relationships with labor unions, before the National Labor Relations Board and in administrative proceedings and litigation over union organizational campaigns, elections, unfair labor practice proceedings, collective bargaining negotiations, arbitrations, and various types of work stoppages.<p>

Attorneys in this Group represent employers in state and federal trial and appellate courts and before administrative agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, and state fair employment practices commissions.  The Group handles discrimination charges, investigations arising from those charges, and litigation involving claims based on race, sex, religion, national origin, age, handicap and veterans  rights laws and regulations.  The Group has considerable experience in complex EEO litigation and jury trials.  In addition, the Group conducts a wide range of compliance training programs and assists employers in the development and audit of affirmative action plans, as well as with OFCCP compliance reviews, "show cause" notices and debarment proceedings.<p>

Labor, ERISA and employment lawyers advise employers on the design, preparation, communication, administration and operation of all forms of employee benefit plans and executive compensation programs and the related funding vehicles, including pension and profit sharing plans, 401(k) plans, leveraged ESOPs, stock option plans, incentive compensation programs, "cafeteria" plans, VEBAs, and on all mergers and acquisitions and other business transactions which involve such plans and programs.  The Firm also represents clients involved in ERISA-related controversies in federal and state courts and before the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. <p>

This Group is experienced in representing clients with respect to various labor standards laws, including wage-hour (including Fair Labor Standards, Walsh-Healey, Davis-Bacon, Service Contract, and Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Acts), occupational safety and health, workers compensation, unemployment compensation, and related matters.<p>

<title>Product Liability Practice</title>

<h1>Product Liability Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King &amp; Spalding has an active practice dedicated to the defense of personal injury tort
litigation in product liability.  During the past 10 years, tort litigation against
institutional and corporate defendants has steadily escalated in scope and potential
exposure.  As the Firm's corporate clients have required increasingly sophisticated
defenses to personal injury claims, the Firm has participated as statewide, regional, and
national tort counsel to various corporations.  At the same time, the Firm has achieved
cost-effective representation through careful staffing of tort matters, reliance on an
experienced staff of legal assistants, and substantial past experience in discovery and
trial practice.<p>

The Firm has trial experience throughout the country, particularly in the Southeast. 
Because of the volume and widespread geographic distribution of its tort practice, King
&amp; Spalding has developed an extended and useful network of local counsel
throughout the country. Similarly, the Firm has worked with a number
of talented expert witnesses in various areas.  The Firm has taken a leadership role in
coordinating nationwide discovery for its clients and in developing sophisticated
computer-based litigation support systems for tort litigation.<p>

King &amp; Spalding lawyers have also been involved in advocating changes to the tort
law
to redress some of the disadvantages experienced by corporate defendants in litigation. 
King &amp; Spalding lawyers have actively participated in the debate over federal reform
of
the tort laws; former Attorney-General Griffin Bell has testified before Congress on
federal product liability laws, and the Firm's Washington office has counseled with
Georgia lawmakers concerning various product liability and environmental issues. 
Members of the Firm's tort section participated in the drafting and eventual adoption of
a tort reform package in Georgia, and King &amp; Spalding has litigated the
constitutionality of those reform provisions after their passage.  In addition, King &amp;
Spalding is heavily involved in the activities of the Product Liability Advisory Council,
an association of approximately 80 major national corporations formed to submit briefs
as friend of the court on pivotal issues of product liability and environmental law.  The
Firm has authored a number of successful amicus briefs for PLAC, and a King &amp;
Spalding partner currently serves on the Executive Committee of that organization.  As
appellate counsel for PLAC and the Firm's other manufacturer clients, King &amp;
Spalding has been responsible for recent significant developments in the law of attorney-client
privilege and work product, summary judgment, automobile crashworthiness, and
preemption.<p>

The Firm's tort defense lawyers are regular speakers at seminars and symposia on
product liability and environmental issues.  King &amp; Spalding lawyers are members of
the American College of Trial Lawyers, the Product Liability Committee of the Defense
Research Institute, the Product Liability Committee of the Litigation Section of the
American Bar Association, the Georgia Product Liability Committee, the Georgia
Defense Lawyers, and the Product Liability Advisory Council.  The Firm is also a
member of the Industrial Defense Library.<p>

The Firm's Product Liability Practice has included representation of a wide variety of
clients and products, including automotive, pharmaceutical, medical device, tobacco,
heavy equipment, and consumer product manufacturers.  In the medical and
pharmaceutical areas, the group has been assisted by food and drug lawyers in King &amp;
Spalding's Washington office, many of whom worked at the Food &amp; Drug
Administration before coming to the Firm.  King &amp; Spalding's product liability practice
has involved traditional trial and appellate work and, more recently, support of and
participation in methods of alternative dispute resolution, such as arbitration and
mediation.<p>

Examples of King &amp; Spalding's representations in product liability defense
include:<p>

<b>Automotive</b>:  The Firm has represented the largest domestic automobile
manufacturer
for more than 25 years, representing that client statewide in personal injury cases and
serving as regional and/or national counsel in various types of recurring litigation.  King &amp; Spalding also represents most of
the Japanese auto manufacturers on a regional basis and has served as defense counsel
for various European motor vehicle manufacturers.  Because of the substantial volume
of product litigation in the automotive area, King &amp; Spalding's involvement in this
practice means that it regularly litigates product liability questions of first impression
which will have subsequent importance for the Firm's non-automotive clients, including
issues of discovery, confidentiality and protective orders, federal and state civil
procedure, the constitutionality of various punitive damage laws, applicable burdens of
proof, and evidentiary issues such as admissibility of similar incidents, competency and
qualification of experts, the admissibility of state-of-the-art evidence, and affirmative
defenses peculiar to the products area.<p>

<b>Tobacco</b>:  The Firm has participated in the national organization of the smoking and health litigation.  The Firm has managed approximately 45 tobacco cases in Texas and has represented a major client as coordinating counsel amongst the major cigarette manufacturers.  This practice has involved the Firm in examination of significant legal issues related to warnings and preemption.<p>

<b>Drugs and medical devices</b>:  King &amp; Spalding has represented a variety of pharmaceutical and medical device companies with regard to their medical products, devices, and services.  The Firm has represented certain drug companies in responding to regulatory investigations, and has served as defense counsel in civil litigation brought by individual consumers of pharmaceutical products.  The Firm recently represented a national provider of healthcare services in a variety of tort liability cases related to the provision of laboratory services.<p>

<b>Food and beverage companies</b>:  The Firm has provided product liability advice to food and beverage companies on various issues of quality control and regulatory compliance.<p>

<b>Heavy equipment</b>:  King &amp; Spalding has defended manufacturers of heavy
industrial
equipment and earthmoving equipment against claims of personal injury arising out of
the design, manufacture, and/or operation of such products.<p>

<b>Consumer products</b>:  The Firm has counseled manufacturers of consumer products about product liability concerns and state and federal regulation.  The Firm has also developed programs of preventive measures for its clients and has served as defense counsel in suits over the safety of consumer products.<p>

<b>Insurance issues</b>:  Because of the increased exposure posed by products liability,
insurers have subjected existing and proposed insurance coverages to close scrutiny. 
The Firm has provided counsel to its insured clients on issues of coverage, the
insurability of punitive damages, and similar questions.<p>

<b>Issues of attorney-client privilege and work product</b>:  Given the increasing reliance
of
manufacturers on in-house legal staffs to advise design personnel of possible product
liability exposure and to oversee environmental compliance, issues of attorney-client
privilege and work product have arisen with particular frequency.  The group has
accordingly developed expertise in both counseling and litigation involving these areas.<p>

<h1>Public Finance Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King &amp; Spalding has been nationally recognized in government financings for more than 60 years.  King &amp; Spalding was the first firm in the southeastern United States to be listed in the <i>Red Book</i>, the official directory for bond counsel whose legal opinions are nationally recognized by major purchasers or underwriters of municipal bonds.  The Firm has continuously maintained a Public Finance Practice to handle tax-exempt financings since the 1930s.  <p>

The Public Finance Practice serves as bond counsel in connection with borrowings by states, counties, cities and public authorities throughout the United States.  King &amp; Spalding has acted as bond counsel for virtually all of the cities and counties within the State of Georgia and has also acted as bond counsel in 39 other states.  <p>

Since the 1960s, the Public Finance Practice has also been active in the area of private activity bonds, working on a variety of financings for utilities, manufacturing facilities, airports, docks, ports, multi-family housing projects, sports facilities, hospitals and convention facilities.  In the municipal bond industry rankings published by the <i>Red Book</i>, King &amp; Spalding ranks 25th among the top 100 bond counsel nationwide and first in the State of Georgia.  <p>

The Public Finance Practice also acts as counsel to underwriters of tax-exempt borrowings and prepares official statements and underwriting agreements in connection with the public sale and distribution of tax-exempt obligations.  King &amp; Spalding served as underwriter's counsel on a larger number of issues, and on a larger dollar volume of issues, than any other firm based in Georgia according to statistics compiled by the <i>Red Book</i>.<p>

The Public Finance Practice's practice includes underwriter's counsel representation on virtually every type of public finance issue, and for both regional and national underwriting firms.  The Public Finance Practice also serves as counsel to placement agents, trustees, letter of credit issuers, remarketing agents and industrial concerns entitled to use tax-exempt financing.  <p>

<title>Energy & Independent Power Practice</title>
</head>

<h1>Energy & Independent Power Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King & Spalding's Energy and Independent Power Practice is primarily based in its New York office, but is substantially integrated with practice groups in the Firm's Atlanta, Washington, D.C. and Houston offices due to the interdisciplinary nature of many energy-related matters.
<P>
Despite deregulation in certain areas, most energy transactions still take place within a complex regulatory environment. Increasing the difficulty of these circumstances are state and federal initiatives aimed at restructuring the role of utility companies, and the dynamic stresses of rapidly increasing competition among natural gas and electricity suppliers, utilities and customers.  Clients considering, or engaged in, energy-related transactions require counsel with broad regulatory and technical expertise to identify critical issues and emerging opportunities, and to create viable project solutions in the face of substantial uncertainty.
<P>
The Firm has an extraordinary breadth of energy experience, stemming both from its nationally-renowned practices in project and public finance, and from experienced energy lawyers with distinctive backgrounds. One served as a senior project finance banker in a major U.S. bank.  Two have a total of over 28 years experience representing independent energy producers and large electric consumers, and others have represented gas and electric utilities in regulatory, corporate, and finance matters.
<P>
These skills have been applied successfully across a broad spectrum of undertakings. We have represented project developers and energy-intensive industrial companies in regulatory proceedings in over forty states and before federal agencies, and have advised on project contracts and structures for projects in the U.S., Latin America, Europe and Asia. The Firm has recently completed or is currently engaged in such matters as negotiating the utility buy-out of a power project, establishing the right of inside-the fence generators to backup power, negotiating electric rates and contracts for industrial customers, organizing and representing groups of financial institutions in several precedent-setting federal and state regulatory proceedings, lobbying federal policy makers on PURPA repeal, and advising power marketers on both strategy issues and transactions. 
<P>
In the past year, the Firm has also played major roles in forming a joint venture between a utility subsidiary and a non-utility company to acquire the energy assets of the world's largest integrated brewery and to provide long-term energy services to the brewery and others on a contract basis and, in another matter, assisting an electric utility subsidiary in maximizing its control of several PURPA qualifying facilities. Thus, while King & Spalding continues to maintain a strong traditional Project Finance Practice, the Firm is also at the forefront of newly emerging energy issues.

<h1>Securities and Shareholder Litigation Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King & Spalding has kept pace with the steady growth of securities and shareholder litigation over the last decade by continuing to expand its practice in this area.  As a result, the Firm has acquired substantial and varied experience in defending litigation and conducting investigations arising out of allegations of securities fraud or breach of fiduciary duties. 
<P>
King & Spalding's clients in securities and shareholder litigation matters have included outside directors, inside officers and directors, corporations, and board committees such as special litigation committees and committees of independent directors in transactional litigation.  Although most of the Firm's work in this area is defense-oriented, King & Spalding has also represented acquiring companies in takeover battles and tender offer litigation.  In addition, the Firm has both defended and prosecuted shareholder derivative actions and other litigation by minority shareholders. 
<P>
The breadth of the Firm's representation in this area enables the Firm to provide its clients with experienced lawyers who are very familiar with tested and successful legal strategies in defending claims of securities fraud and breach of fiduciary duties.  The Firm has also worked closely with a number of the leading expert economists whose testimony is vital to a strong defense of these actions.  The Firm's attorneys are particularly experienced in dealing with the complexities associated with the defense of parallel civil litigation and governmental/criminal investigations.
<P>
<STRONG>Representative Securities and Shareholder Litigation Matters</STRONG>
<P>
King & Spalding's Securities and Shareholder Litigation Practice has included a broad range of litigation and/or investigations concerning securities offerings; compliance with financial accounting standards; mergers and acquisitions; tender offers; proxy contests; and claims of insider trading.  <P>
While the Firm's representation in this practice area is centered in the Southeast, King & Spalding has represented clients in a number of securities/shareholder litigation matters in New York, Delaware, Illinois, Washington, D.C., and California.  Representative securities/shareholder litigation matters in which the Firm's attorneys have been involved include the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Defense of a public REIT and certain of its trustees and officers in litigation seeking to enjoin a merger with a non-public affiliated REIT.<P>
<LI>Defense of a large retail sales company and certain of its directors and officers in securities fraud suits, a shareholder derivative action, and parallel grand jury and SEC investigations.<P>
<LI>Defense of inside officers and directors against securities fraud and breach of fiduciary duties claims in four separate civil actions involving one of the nation's largest bank failures. <P>

<P>Mike Taylor recently rejoined King &amp; Spalding after five years in public
service as Deputy Commissioner for Policy of the Food and Drug Administration
(1991-1994) and as Administrator at the Food Safety and Inspection Service at
the U. S. Department of Agriculture (1994-1996). During most of his tenure at
USDA, Mr. Taylor also served as Acting Under Secretary for Food Safety.  </P>
<P>The statutory scheme for regulation of food, drugs, cosmetics, and medical
devices is complex and evolving. Between 1980 and 1994, Congress enacted 31
distinct laws enlarging, and often complicating, FDA's responsibilities in these
areas. King &amp; Spalding lawyers have been actively involved in the
legislative process.  Gene Pfeifer helped draft the legislation regarding
generic human drugs. Jess Stribling did the same for generic animal drugs. Fred
Degnan helped draft the legislation regarding infant formulas. Ed Basile and
Dvorah Richman are recognized authorities in interpreting the most recent
amendments to FDA's authority over medical devices.</P>
<P>The Food and Drug lawyers utilize the services of several practice areas
within the Firm. These include a large litigation practice with substantial
experience in product liability and health and safety related matters, and
lawyers in the healthcare, legislative, environmental, patent, trademark and
general corporate practices.</P>

<H1>Special Matters Practice</H1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
The Special Matters Group consists of trial lawyers experienced and knowledgeable in criminal and civil investigations. The Group was formed in part as a result of King & Spalding's participation in two public internal corporate investigations, E.F. Hutton and Exxon Valdez, which demonstrated the Firm's ability to respond rapidly and effectively to major catastrophic corporate events. Those investigations, led by former United States Attorney General Griffin B. Bell, established the Firm as a leader in corporate internal investigations and related litigation. The Special Matters Group has since been involved in numerous internal investigations for a host of companies, small and large, ranging from confidential investigations to investigations involving high-profile matters of public interest.
<P>
The volume of work and number of lawyers involved in an internal investigation vary based on the confidentiality and scope of the representation. Whether the matter is a short-term, confidential investigation handled by one lawyer, or an extensive analysis involving matters of public interest, internal corporate investigations and related criminal and civil litigation require the highest degree of care and sensitivity. These investigations are generally performed for a corporate board of directors, the outside directors or for the Chief Executive Officer, although they may be performed for an independent committee of the board of directors or after a shareholder derivative suit has been filed. The primary objectives in these matters are to assess responsibility, defend against any charges and structure creative solutions to the problems which give rise to the investigations. Examples of issues that may be confronted in connection with such an investigation are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>the manner in which the investigation is conducted;
<LI>who conducts it;
<LI>evidentiary issues involving the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product doctrine;
<LI>testimony before a state or federal grand jury or Congressional committee;
<LI>dealing with governmental agencies in connection with regulatory investigations;
<LI>evaluation of legal issues such as antitrust, RICO, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the possible criminalization of unintentional negligence, and other regulatory laws involving government procurement fraud and securities violations;
<LI>evaluation of possible vicarious liability of a corporate parent for acts of one of its employees or of an employee of a wholly-owned subsidiary;
<LI>considerations relating to presentations to government officials to avoid prosecution;
<LI>negotiating with government officials concerning criminal charges and civil fraud claims; and
<LI>preparing trial defenses while conducting the internal investigation.

</OL>
<P>
In addition to conducting internal investigations, the Special Matters Group defends corporations and individuals in a wide variety of criminal, Congressional or regulatory investigations. Corporations and corporate officers facing a broad spectrum of charges or related shareholder derivative litigation have retained Special Matters lawyers, who have also represented businesses that have been victimized by dishonest employees, vendors or others. The Group also assists in legal audits and counsels preventive law, such as advice about compliance programs and systems that monitor corporate and individual conduct. The Group frequently has assisted corporations and individuals in avoiding prosecution through compliance efforts and early investigative steps followed by presentations to the government.
<P>
Government regulatory investigations are on the rise and Special Matters lawyers frequently will join forces with lawyers in the Firm's substantive regulatory practice areas, including FDA, Environmental, Healthcare and Antitrust. Critical to this area of practice is the ability to respond rapidly to corporate crises, precipitated by any of a wide variety of events, including civil suits, whistleblower complaints and sudden government investigations accompanied by the execution of search warrants and/or the issuance of subpoenas. The Group has the expertise to handle matters from their inception through trial and appellate phases if necessary.
<P>
The Special Matters Group includes: former U.S. Attorney General Griffin B. Bell; former Independent Counsel of the HUD investigation and U.S. Attorney Larry D. Thompson; former Department of Justice Chief of the Criminal Fraud Section William C. Hendricks, III; former Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen S. Cowen; former Deputy Independent Counsel of the Whitewater Investigation William S. Duffey, Jr.; and former Assistant U.S. Attorney and U.S. Senate Special Counsel J. Sedwick Sollers III.

<H1>Government Contracts Practice</H1><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
King & Spalding's Government Contracts Practice has developed a very substantial base of experience in federal and state procurements involving information technology.  Depending on the expertise required,  we often assign attorneys from the Intellectual Property and Technology, Civil Litigation, and Special Matters Practice Groups to assist with government contracts matters.  These attorneys work under the leadership of our experienced government contracts practitioners.  This team approach has proven to be cost-effective for our clients especially in large, complex matters and has given us a substantial surge capacity.  Some representative government contracts matters are described below.
<P>
<STRONG>Contract Formation.  </STRONG>King & Spalding assisted a major computer systems integrator in the negotiation of a $150 million contract with the New York City Police Department for the design and implementation of two new E911 public safety answering centers for the City of New York.  King & Spalding also assisted this client with the negotiation of the subcontracts for this project.  The negotiations leading to the prime contract and subcontracts took place in New York City over a four month period.  King & Spalding continues to be part of the client's E911 project team.  We have also counseled clients competing for major government contract awards in preparing proposals and negotiating with the government.  We have negotiated with federal and state procurement officials on behalf of our clients.  
<P>
<STRONG>Bid Protests.  </STRONG>King & Spalding has represented clients in protests involving the award of federal government contracts.  Two of these protests were filed with the General Accounting Office.  The other protest involved computer resources and was filed with the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals.  The clients had been selected for award but were forced to intervene when protests were filed by unsuccessful bidders.  We successfully defended both awards.  King & Spalding also filed a bid protest with the State of Maryland on behalf of a major computers systems integrator which facilitated resolution of a related contract dispute.
<P>
<STRONG>Contract Disputes.  </STRONG>King & Spalding has represented clients in disputes involving government contracts at both the federal and state levels.  We currently represent a client in a subcontractor claim following the termination of an equipment lease by the General Services Administration for the convenience of the government.  The client had financed computer based publishing equipment that had been installed in government sites in Atlanta and Fort Worth.  We currently represent a major oil company in a dispute over the price of crude oil that it provided to the Defense Fuel Supply Center for the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve.  The matter is pending before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.  King & Spalding successfully represented a major computer systems integrator in a dispute with the State of Maryland involving the implementation of a statewide information system to determine welfare eligibility and entitlements.   Also, we recently successfully resolved a claim against the State of Oregon arising out of a software development contract. 
<P>
<STRONG>Special Matters.  </STRONG>Government contract compliance issues have been an important part of King & Spalding's Government Contracts Practice.  We have represented several clients in federal suspension and debarment proceedings.  In one matter, we negotiated a two-year compliance agreement with the Department of the Navy, in lieu of debarment, after the client pleaded guilty to one count of making a false official statement in connection with a Navy charter party contract during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm.  In another matter, we were successful in persuading the Environmental Protection Agency not to proceed with suspension or debarment because the client had taken sufficient corrective actions following a serious environmental violation.  We represented a major healthcare client in the defense of a <EM>qui tam </EM>action brought by a former employee.  We have conducted internal investigations for several major defense contractors in response to allegations of wrong doing or noncompliance by employees in connection with the companies' government contracts and have assisted clients in making voluntary disclosures to the government.  
<P>
<STRONG>Counseling.  </STRONG>Besides the matters discussed above, King & Spalding has counseled clients on other government contracts in a variety of issues involving contract performance and compliance with government cost accounting issues.

<h1>Governmental Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King & Spalding's Governmental Practice Group offers effective advocacy before legislative and executive branch decision makers.  The Group consists of two lawyers, Ted Hester and Bill Talmadge, and three non-lawyer legislative specialists, Dean Mitchell, Allison Dowd and Lakon Holloway.  All worked on Capitol Hill earlier in their careers and have maintained their working relationships with Congress.  The Group has substantial experience working with various executive branch agencies, and understands the political implications that accompany government work.  The Governmental Practice Group is supplemented by the extensive resources of King & Spalding which include former Attorney General Griffin Bell and other lawyers throughout the Firm who have held various positions in governmental departments and agencies. 
<P>
<STRONG>Congressional Investigations</STRONG>.  Congressional committees occasionally develop interests in matters that involve our clients, usually because of the committees' oversight responsibilities for executive departments or agencies that regulate or contract with our clients.  Frequently, the committees will ask to review confidential or proprietary information or information that is the subject of pending litigation.  Protecting a defendant's proprietary information and litigation posture while balancing the impact of negative publicity can be a real challenge.  The Governmental Group has represented a number of clients in connection with congressional investigations.  
<P>
<STRONG>Legislative Representation and Governmental Intervention</STRONG>.  The Governmental Group regularly represents clients before Congress, executive departments and independent agencies.  When feasible, the Governmental Group prefers to establish a continuing relationship with clients in order to take advantage of evolving opportunities and to deflect emerging problems.  The Group is able to efficiently monitor relevant legislative and regulatory developments from a client's perspective by utilizing its non-lawyer legislative specialists.  
<P>
The Governmental Group has been involved in a wide range of legislative and regulatory activities for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games ("ACOG").  Remarkably, ACOG is a primary beneficiary of two freestanding bills that have been enacted into law with the Governmental Group leading the effort.  In 1992, Congress passed the Atlanta Centennial Olympic Commemorative Coin Act which will raise significant revenues to help defray the cost of the Olympic Games.  In 1994, Congress passed a bill providing for duty free entry of goods that will be brought into the United States for the Olympic Games and similar events.  The Governmental Group also has coordinated efforts for ACOG on various authorization and appropriations bills that have led to funding for security measures and buses that will be provided during the Games.  Additionally, the Governmental Group has worked directly with the White House and executive agencies to coordinate a variety of Olympic issues, one current example being negotiations with the Department of State to expedite the entry of participants in the Games into the United States.

<P>A Firm client who belongs to several trade associations has elected to have the Governmental Group monitor the Congressional Committees that have jurisdiction over mental health and substance abuse issues.  The Governmental Group is representing its interest in having mental health benefits included in any nationally guaranteed benefits package that may be enacted as part of health care reform. Another Firm client has retained our Governmental Group on an ongoing basis as consultants on defense authorization and appropriations issues.
<P>
The Governmental Group is working with King & Spalding's International Trade Group to represent a coalition of cement companies in connection with the formulation of implementing legislation for the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.
<P>
A Georgia based Chamber of Commerce hired the Governmental Group to represent the community's interest when a local Marine Corps Depot appeared on the Base Closure Commission's list of military bases that might be closed or realigned.  Working closely with Congress and directly with the Base Closure Commission and its staff, the Governmental Group prepared and presented the case for maintaining the present capacity at the Marine Depot.  The Base Closure Commission adopted that position.
<P>
<STRONG>Federal Election/Government Ethics Laws.  </STRONG>The Governmental Group advises on questions relating to the federal election laws and action committees.  Since a major legislative goal of the 103rd Congress and the Clinton Administration is to reform the lobbying laws and current PAC reporting requirements, the Governmental Group has been following the reform bills as they move through the legislative process.  It is expected that if reform legislation is enacted, the Governmental Group will counsel clients on changes in the law and guide them in their compliance efforts.

<h1>Toxic Tort Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
The Toxic Tort Practice at King &amp; Spalding includes representation of major
manufacturers in the following industries: chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, herbicide and pesticide, automotive, petroleum, capacitor manufacturing, railroad tank car manufacturing, hazardous waste disposal and others.<p>

The Firm has been heavily involved in PCB and dioxin litigation, including major class action representation.  In addition, the Firm has been involved in a variety of chemical substances cases such as asbestos, formaldehyde, solvents (such as TCE), petroleum products, pesticides, methane, hydrogen sulfide and other chemicals.<p>

Our toxic tort litigation has involved individual claims, class actions, and multiple claims under various types of case management orders.  The claims have been brought by workers, surrounding property owners, riparian owners, and product end-users.  Exposure claims have involved air, water, soil, food, and other routes of exposure.  Injury claims have included personal illnesses (including immune system impairment), fear, increased risk of disease, property damage and business losses. <P>

Equally important, the Toxic Tort Practice has afforded us the opportunity to work closely with leading experts throughout the country in a variety of disciplines including toxicology, epidemiology, immunology, neurology, psychiatry, oncology, teratology, risk assessment, chemistry, hydrology, geology, aquatics, waste water treatment, air dispersion modeling, and many more.  Similarly, we have come up against many of the familiar plaintiffs' experts in toxic tort cases, including those who espouse "theories" of
clinical ecology, chemical AIDS, "one-hit" causation, multiple chemical sensitivity and others. <p>

<h1>Trusts &amp; Estates Practice</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
Since its founding in 1885, King &amp; Spalding has placed major emphasis on serving as counselor to families in Georgia and the Southeast regarding the transfer of wealth.  Firm lawyers have consistently taken a leadership role in estate and trust law and transfer tax developments on the state and national levels.  The Trusts and Estates Practice includes John A. Wallace, past President of the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel and Chairman of the Section of Real Property, Probate and Trust Law of the American Bar Association.<p>

The Trusts and Estates Practice is divided into six general areas:<p>

<b>Estate planning and drafting wills and trusts.  </b>Lawyers advise clients on advantageous estate planning opportunities as they apply within the context of the particular family situation.  The drafting projects are typically quite sophisticated due to the complexity of the estates of many clients.<p>

<b>Estate planning with closely held businesses and significant investment assets.  </b>Lawyers work closely with the Tax, Corporate, and Real Estate Groups to effect tax efficient transfers of closely held business and other special assets.  The Firm's representation of foreign clients, both resident and nonresident, requires the lawyers also to maintain an expertise in the international tax area.<p>

<b>Administration of estates and trusts.  </b>Lawyers advise corporate and individual fiduciaries regarding estate and trust administration, including post-mortem tax advice and return preparation.  The lawyers handle the Firm's representation of a U.S. bank which has the largest personal trust department in the Southeast.<p>

<b>Charitable and exempt organization representation.  </b>Lawyers represent private foundations, universities, hospitals and other charitable organizations of regional and national importance.  In addition, lawyers assist clients with the establishment of private family foundations and other charitable and nonprofit corporations, as well as structuring various types of lifetime and testamentary charitable gifts and bequests.<p>

<b>Tax controversy matters.  </b>Trusts and Estates lawyers frequently represent clients before the Internal Revenue Service and, if necessary, in various state and federal courts, in connection with estate and gift tax audits, and other tax controversies.  Lawyers usually work on these matters in conjunction with the Firm's Litigation attorneys.<p>

<b>Will contest and other court proceedings.  </b>Trusts and Estates lawyers handle will contests and litigation seeking the proper construction of wills and trusts.  They have opportunities to appear before numerous courts and call upon the support of lawyers from the Litigation Practice in the case of contested matters.<p>

<P>
Sarah Borders is a partner in King & Spalding's Bankruptcy and Commercial Litigation Group. Ms. Borders' practice focuses on the restructuring of real estate indebtedness and the representation of multi-creditor groups.
<P>
Ms. Borders recently completed the representation of thirty-one lending institutions in the out-of-court restructuring of over $1 billion of indebtedness owed by a large real estate developer. The transaction consolidated the developer's worldwide real estate holdings by converting competing project loans into publicly registered debt and equity in a newly created entity. The restructuring required the unanimous consent of each lender and was the culmination of five years of intense negotiations among the creditors and the various debtors.
<P>
Currently, Ms. Borders is responsible for the representation of a leading lending institution in the restructuring of thirty-eight nonperforming real estate loans totaling $200 million. The loans were purchased as part of a $1 billion portfolio auctioned by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  Ms. Borders has successfully negotiated the consensual restructuring of a substantial portion of the portfolio and continues to prosecute claims in the numerous single asset real estate cases filed by the remainder of the borrowers.
<P>
In 1995, Ms. Borders completed the restructuring of $100 million of indebtedness owed to a Japanese lender and secured by a prominent Atlanta office building. The restructuring was completed under supervision of the bankruptcy court and in a manner calculated to mitigate adverse tax repercussion for the Borrower.
<P>
Ms. Borders also represented the committee of unsecured creditors for a chain of 128 convenience stores. A bankruptcy plan was confirmed, which provided for payment in full of all claims owed to creditors.
<P>
Ms. Borders is native of Louisiana, a 1984 graduate of Louisiana State University, a 1988 graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law and a former law clerk for Judge Henry A. Politz of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.<P>

<P>
Former Georgia Governor George Busbee is a retired partner at King & Spalding and remains Counsel to the Firm, which he joined in 1983. He is the first Georgia chief executive ever to be elected to two consecutive four-year terms, and made economic development and quality education the hallmarks of his administration.
<P>
In each of the last five years of his terms as governor, Mr. Busbee helped attract new and expanded industrial investment exceeding $1 billion to the state, with particular emphasis on high technology industry, as is evidenced by the establishment of the Advanced Technology Development Center in conjunction with the Georgia Institute of Technology. The major thrust of improvements in Mr. Busbee's last budget as governor was the expansion of high technology training capability in Georgia's 26 vocational-technical schools, with emphasis on micro-mechanics and machine tool skills.
<P>
Mr. Busbee was chosen by his fellow governors to head the Southern Growth Policies Board, a consortium of Southern States aimed at enhancing the region's competitive edge in economic development. His highest honor came in 1980-81 when he was unanimously elected by his fellow governors from throughout the nation and the U.S. Territories as Chairman of the National Governors' Association. Prior to that election, Mr. Busbee served as Chairman of the NGA's Committee on International Trade and Foreign Relations. As chairman of that committee, he was instrumental in helping congressional committees write the Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Trade Procedures Simplification Act of 1980.
<P>
In 1976, Mr. Busbee joined with Mr. Norishige Hasegawa, Chairman of the Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd., to promote the founding of the Japan/S.E.U.S. Association. President Carter paid tribute to Mr. Busbee's extensive experience in international trade by naming him to the President's Export Council. He was reappointed to the Council by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 and continued to serve during the Reagan Administration until 1985.
<P>
Mr. Busbee is Past Chairman of the Atlanta Metro Chamber of Commerce, Past Chairman of the Japan-America Society of Georgia and Past President of the Metro Business Forum. He current serves as Chairman of the Steering Committee of Vision 2020 (a long-term planning project of the Atlanta Regional Commission) and is a member of the Boards of Directors of Union Camp Corporation, Delta Air Lines, Inc. and Rose's Stores, Inc. In January 1993, Mr. Busbee was elected to an international technology firm based in Ottawa, Canada known as SHL SystemHouse, Inc.
<P>
A native of Vienna, Georgia, Mr. Busbee attended Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, Duke University and the University of Georgia. After receiving his law degree from the University of Georgia School of Law, Mr. Busbee moved to Albany, Georgia, where he entered the practice of law.  Mr. Busbee served for 18 years as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives, having been elected in 1956 at the age of 29. In 1967, he was elected as the House's first majority leader, a position he retained until taking the oath of office as Governor in 1975.<P>

<p>
Walt Driver is a partner in King & Spalding's Banking and Finance Practice Group. He served as Chairman of the Firm's Policy Committee for the maximum term from 1990-1993.
<P>
Mr. Driver represented over thirty money center banks in structuring, negotiating and closing the restructuring of over $1 billion of liabilities of a large real estate developer and its affiliates. The transaction provided liquidity for creditors by converting competing project loans into publicly registered debt and equity in a newly created entity. The November 1995 closing concluded five years of intense negotiating among the creditors and against the various debtors.
<P>
Mr. Driver has been the principal U.S. lawyer representing a large multi-national bank in one of the largest and most complex bank fraud cases in U.S. history, involving billions of dollars in finance to Iraq. This affair generated high political visibility during the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign and several books have been written on the subject. Through King & Spalding's involvement, officers outside of the rogue Atlanta employees avoided criminal prosecution. Mr. Driver led the client through Congressional committee investigations and hearings, successfully resolved a protracted Federal Reserve inquiry and achieved substantial economic recoveries, including $400 million from the United States government.
<P>
He was responsible for the representation of one of the largest money center banks in connection with its substantial real estate lending portfolio in the Southeast, as well as successfully litigating a case of first impression involving banking fraud and negotiable instrument liabilities.
<P>
Mr. Driver is involved with many aspects of representation of financial institutions, including structured transactions, real estate finance, work-out and bankruptcy and banking investigations. He has advised institutional investors in highly leveraged and tax sensitive transactions, working with King & Spalding's tax lawyers in complex cross-border financings. Mr. Driver represents money center banks, regional banks, international banks and large non-bank financial corporations, and coordinates King & Spaliding's legal work for a number of major financial clients.
<P>
He has chaired the Legal Division of the Atlanta United Way and has served as a member of the Board of Directors and Executive Committees of several civic organizations, including Central Atlanta Progress, Peachtree Golf Club and the Georgia State Golf Association. A graduate of Stanford University and the University of Texas School of Law (1970), he joined King & Spalding in 1970 and became a partner in 1976.

Ralph Levy, Managing Partner of King & Spalding, is a bankruptcy and commercial litigator.  He joined the Firm as an associate in 1974 and was admitted to the partnership in 1979.
<P>
Throughout his 20-year career at the Firm, Mr. Levy has served clients in a broad range of financially-oriented litigation, representing national firms of accountants and actuaries in professional malpractice and securities cases, major financial institutions in bankruptcy, lender liability and other commercial cases, and corporate and partnership taxpayers in disputes with the IRS. 
<P>
To strengthen the litigation component of the Firm's bankruptcy and creditors  rights practice, particularly in contested bankruptcy hearings on valuation, cram-down, relief from stay, and cash collateral disputes, Mr. Levy joined the Firm's Bankruptcy and Commercial Litigation Group, where his practice has become even more focused on the litigation side of representing lender clients in bankruptcy and other insolvency related disputes.  This recent internal reorganization, which consolidates substantive bankruptcy experience with pre-trial discovery and trial expertise, permits the Firm to consistently bring to bear on bankruptcy matters the same level of litigation planning and execution skills that are afforded to non-bankruptcy litigation representations. 
<P>
Mr. Levy is a member of the International Society of Barristers and has taught advanced litigation skills as a member of the visiting faculty for Emory Law School's Masters of Litigation program.
<P>
In 1970, he received his J.D., cum laude, from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he also was awarded the Order of the Coif.  He has served as a military trial lawyer and judge in the U.S. Navy JAGC (1971-1974; Navy Commendation Medal).<P>

<P>
Chilton Varner has 20 years of courtroom experience as a trial lawyer defending corporations in product liability and commercial disputes.  One of the few women to be elected a fellow in the American College of Trial Lawyers, she has served as trial and appellate counsel for some of the country's largest automotive, pharmaceutical, and medical device manufacturers.  She has also developed "preventive law" strategies for those corporations to assist them in avoiding future claims and in preparing them to defend such claims should they arise.  She has substantial experience in mass tort litigation and class actions, including the complex issues of discovery and attorney-client privilege which accompany such suits.  
<P>Examples of Mrs. Varner's experience include:
<P><UL>
<LI>She is one of approximately 40 lawyers selected by a major automobile manufacturer as lead counsel for the company's product liability litigation nationwide.  In the past year she has obtained defense verdicts in three cases against the client: a case in Georgia involving a recalled product; a death case in Tennessee involving claims of a defective restraint system; and a death case in Kentucky involving a post-collision fire.
<P><LI>She is a member of the national trial team representing a client in breast implant suits, with lead counsel responsibility for all cases in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and South Carolina, as well as selected cases in Texas and elsewhere in the United States.
<P><LI>As trial counsel, she successfully defended an international food and beverage company in a class action brought by a group of approximately one hundred independent bottlers claiming over $100 million in damages for alleged violation of their bottling contracts.  The case lasted 11 years and was the largest ever tried in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware: it involved three separate trials, an appeal to the Third Circuit and a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.
<P><LI>She defends the country's largest group of private laboratories against claims of malpractice, including lawsuits arising out of pap smears, drug screens, and AIDS testing.
<P><LI>On behalf of a major automobile manufacturer, she argued the appeals of the largest product liability verdicts ever awarded in Alabama and Mississippi.
<P><LI>She is a member of the Product Liability Advisory Council, a consortium of over one hundred of the country's major product manufacturers formed to file amicus briefs on critical issues of product liability.  She has authored a number of amicus briefs for PLAC, including a brief in Shelton v. American Motors, 805 F.2d 1323 (8th Cir. 1986) which successfully proposed a landmark test limiting the availability of depositions of in-house counsel.  She was also the first outside counsel to serve on PLAC's executive committee (1991-94).
<P><LI>She has been admitted to practice pro hac vice in the courts of Alabama, Tennessee, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, Texas, New York, Missouri, California, and Kentucky.
<P>

<h1>The Revival of Vertical Merger Enforcement
</h1>
<p>
<h2><a href="/htm/blumenth.htm">William Blumenthal</a> and Kara L. Bue</h2>
<H6>Copyright &copy; 1994 by Matthew Bender & Co., Inc. Reprinted with permission from the February 1994, <EM>Antitrust Report</EM>. All rights reserved.</H6>
<HR><p>
</CENTER>
<p>
After an extended period of dormancy, vertical merger enforcement by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission has revived.  Since the fourth quarter of 1993, the agencies have issued more vertical merger complaints than in the entire preceding fifteen-year period.  All of the complaints in the recent wave were resolved by consent agreements.  Although agency statements accompanying the complaints and consent agreements, together with speeches by enforcement officials, offer some indication of the agencies' current emerging standards, the specifics remain unclear in many important respects. 
<P>
<H4>	Background: A Brief History of Vertical Merger Policy
	<BR>Prior to the Recent Wave</H4>
<P>
	The first Supreme Court case to address vertical merger law was <EM>United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.</EM>, 353 U.S. 586 (1957), <EM>rev'g and remanding </EM>126 F. Supp. 235 (N.D. Ill. 1954).  Decided under the original version of Section 7 of the Clayton Act and therefore of limited precedential value, the case arose from a 1949 complaint challenging du Pont's gradual acquisition of 23% of the stock of General Motors from 1917 to 1919.  At the time of the challenge, General Motors was the largest automobile manufacturer in the world; by 1955 it supplied 48.8% of the cars sold in the United States.  du Pont was the largest chemical company in the world and a major supplier of automobile finishes and fabrics.  In 1947 it supplied General Motors with 67% of its requirements for finishes and 35.7% of its requirements for fabrics.  The complaint alleged that du Pont's supply position with General Motors arose from its ownership interest and that the insulation of General Motors from market forces would substantially lessen competition and tend to create a monopoly.  
<P>
	The Supreme Court (in a four-to-two decision) held that du Pont's acquisition of General Motors stock was unlawful, and it remanded for determination of relief.  After holding that the Clayton Act applied to vertical mergers and defining the relevant markets, the Court stated a two-prong test for assessing the legality of a vertical merger: (1) the affected market must be substantial, and (2) foreclosure of competition in a substantial share of the market must be likely.  The Court readily found that the first prong was satisfied.  With respect to the second prong, the Court found that du Pont (despite its minority interest) was active and influential in General Motors' affairs and, at the time of the acquisition, had expressed its intent to use its interest to help secure business.  du Pont's power to influence General Motors' purchase decision on grounds unrelated to competitive merits "foreclosed" General Motors to du Pont's competitors, regardless of whether the power was actually exercised.

	The next vertical merger case to come before the Supreme Court -- and the first under the Celler-Kefauver Amendments to Section 7 -- was <EM>Brown Shoe Co. v. United States,</EM> 370 U.S. 294 (1962).  Largely by virtue of dearth of other authority, it remains the leading decision today.  The case arose from a 1955 complaint challenging the merger of Brown Shoe Company and G.R. Kinney Company.  Both companies manufactured and retailed men's, women's, and children's shoes, but Brown was primarily a manufacturer and Kinney primarily a retailer.  At the time of the merger, Brown was the fourth largest manufacturer of shoes in the United States, with a production market share of approximately four percent.  Kinney was the largest shoe retailer in the United States, with a retail market share of approximately 1.6%; it was also the twelfth largest manufacturer, with a production market share of approximately 0.5%.  Kinney's manufacturing facilities supplied about 20% of the shoes sold by Kinney retail stores.  At the time of the merger, Brown did not supply shoes to Kinney; but by 1957 Brown had become Kinney's largest outside source, supplying 7.9% of Kinney's retail needs. 
<P>
	The Supreme Court affirmed a district court finding that the acquisition violated the amended Section 7.  After reviewing the legislative history of the amendments, the Court turned to vertical aspects of the transaction.  Echoing the <EM>du Pont</EM> decision, the Court stated that the "primary vice of a vertical merger" is the foreclosure of competitors, which acts as a "clog on competition" and "deprive[s] . . . rivals of a fair opportunity to compete."  After defining the relevant markets, the Court stated that market share would be an important, but seldom determinative consideration.  (It would be determinative if it either approached monopoly proportions or fell below a <EM>de minimis</EM> threshold, which the Court implicitly set at something under two percent.)  The Court identified numerous other "economic and historical factors" that would go to legality.  The first and "most important such factor" was the nature and purpose of the arrangement.  Another was the trend towards concentration in the industry.
<P>
	The only other vertical merger case decided by the Supreme Court was <EM>Ford Motor Co. v. United States</EM>, 405 U.S. 562 (1972), <EM>aff'g </EM>286 F. Supp. 407 (E.D. Mich. 1968) & 315 F. Supp. 372 (E.D. Mich. 1970).  The case arose from a 1961 complaint challenging Ford's acquisition of certain assets of Electric Autolite Company.  Autolite was a leading manufacturer of automotive lighting and ignition systems.  From 1934 to 1955, it had been primary supplier of Chrysler's electrical needs.  Chrysler began to diversify its sources in 1956, however, and was purchasing two-thirds of its batteries from Autolite's competitors by 1960.  Autolite remained Chrysler's primary supplier of spark plugs, but feared that Chrysler would repeat its diversification, leaving Autolite with a large, fixed-volume facility with substantial overcapacity.  In response, Autolite sought to convince Ford, which had been buying exclusively from an Autolite competitor, to internalize its requirements by purchasing Autolite manufacturing facilities.  Ford and Autolite entered into a transaction pursuant to which Ford acquired Autolite's spark plug facility, one of Autolite's six battery facilities, and the Autolite trade name.  By virtue of the transaction, Ford became self-sufficient in spark plugs, but continued to purchase many of its batteries from outside sources.  Autolite continued to produce batteries, and it re-entered manufacture of spark plugs on a small scale for private label accounts (which included General Motors and Chrysler). 
<P>
	The district court had found a violation in both the battery and spark plug markets.  In batteries, the court had found that Ford's mere acquisition of the facility would not result in substantial foreclosure, but that Ford's additional acquisition of the Autolite name would result in goodwill leading to aftermarket sales, thus making inevitable total foreclosure on the order of 6.2% of industry shipments.  In spark plugs, the court had found that Autolite accounted for 15% of industry shipments, that Ford accounted for 9.6% of industry purchases, and that the elimination of Ford as an independent purchaser was sufficient to establish a "blatant" violation of Section 7.  In addition, the court wrote, taken together with General Motors' vertical integration in spark plugs, the transaction had raised barriers to entry into spark plug manufacture and removed a constraint on the pricing behavior of independent spark plug manufacturers.  The Supreme Court review was limited to the spark plug market.  After summarizing and quoting the district court, the Supreme Court affirmed.  It emphasized that Ford's argument that the acquisition had made Autolite a more effective competitor was irrelevant.
<P>
	For a number of years following <EM>Brown Shoe</EM> and <EM>Ford </EM>(<EM>Autolite</EM>), lower courts found various mergers unlawful on theories of vertical foreclosure.  Some of the cases also focused (as in <EM>Ford </EM>(<EM>Autolite</EM>)) on the horizontal effects of vertical mergers, either through elimination of potential entry or by increases in barriers to entry.  <EM>See generally </EM>1 <EM>ABA Antitrust Section, Antitrust Law Developments</EM> 330-31 (3d ed. 1992).  In conducting their analyses, courts focused on several questions:
<P>
	(1) what percentage of the market was foreclosed; (2) what was the purpose of the acquisition, particularly the degree to which the acquiring firm used or intended to use the acquired firm captively; (3) what was the effect of the acquisition on local businesses; (4) what was the degree of concentration in the relevant markets; (5) was there a trend toward vertical integration in the industry, and what was the historical role of the merging firms in contributing to any such trend; and (6) did or could the acquisition increase barriers to entry into either or both levels of manufacturing or distribution.
<P>
<H4><EM>ABA Antitrust Section,</EM> Monograph No. 14, <EM>Non-Horizontal Mergers: Law and Policy </EM>19-20 (1988).</H4>
<P>
	By the late 1970s, however, judicial attitudes towards vertical relationships had shifted substantially, as courts, commentators, and enforcement agencies began to focus on the efficiency-enhancing potential of vertical agreements and to question the competitive risks associated with foreclosure.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, <EM>Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.</EM>, 433 U.S. 36 (1977).  The receptiveness of courts to vertical merger challenges dropped off sharply.  In <EM>Alberta Gas Chemicals, Ltd. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.</EM>, 826 F.2d 1235 (3d Cir. 1987), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 486 U.S. 1059 (1988), for example, the circuit court rejected a private plaintiff's challenge to a vertical merger after observing that "respected scholars question the anticompetitive effects of vertical mergers" due to foreclosure risk and that the merger might well "result in efficiencies."  Other courts similarly have dismissed vertical merger challenges in recent years, either because foreclosure was <EM>de minimis</EM> or because foreclosure was not likely to injure competition.  <EM>See generally </EM>1 <EM>Antitrust Law Developments, supra,</EM> at 332 nn. 340-42.  The frequency of enforcement agency intervention against vertical mergers ground to a near-halt, although the agencies did not abandon the field entirely.  <EM>See Occidental Petroleum Corp.</EM>, 3 Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH)  22,349 (FTC Apr. 11, 1986); <EM>Arco Chemical Co.</EM>, 113 F.T.C. 1050 (1990).
<P>
	The shift in enforcement attitudes towards vertical mergers was reflected in the Antitrust Division's 1982 Merger Guidelines.  The Guidelines took no express account of adverse vertical competitive effects and instead treated vertical mergers under a discussion captioned "Horizontal Effect from Non-Horizontal Mergers."  Three adverse horizontal effects that might flow from vertical mergers were identified.  The first, echoing one of the theories of <EM>Ford (Autolite),</EM> was that vertical mergers might increase barriers to entry under specified, limited conditions.  The second possible effect was that vertical mergers might facilitate horizontal collusion, either by facilitating monitoring of prices at the retail level or by eliminating a disruptive buyer.  The third was that vertical mergers might facilitate the evasion of rate regulation.  The Antitrust Division's 1984 Merger Guidelines reiterated these provisions without material change.  The joint Antitrust Division/FTC 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines by their terms were limited to horizontal mergers, but a statement accompanying their release indicated that "[s]pecific guidance on non-horizontal mergers is provided in Section 4 of the Department's 1984 <EM>Merger Guidelines</EM>, read in the context of today's revisions to the treatment of horizontal mergers."  Reprinted in 2 <EM>Antitrust Law Developments, supra</EM>, at 1368.

<P>
<H4>	The Recent Enforcement Wave</H4>
<P>
	After their extended quiescence towards vertical mergers, the Antitrust Division and FTC have reawakened with vigor.  Some of their challenges to vertical mergers have been based upon theories articulated -- or at least hinted at -- in the Guidelines.  Others go considerably beyond the Guidelines, and some seem to go beyond even the old case law.  We summarize the cases here.
<P>
<strong>Paramount/QVC</strong>
<P>
	The first case in the recent enforcement wave was <EM>In the Matter of Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation, </EM>FTC File No. 941-0008 (Nov. 30, 1993), an FTC action involving the acquisition of Paramount by TCI and Liberty through QVC.  The allegations of the complaint were as follows:  TCI is the largest cable television multiple system operator ("MSO") in the United States.  Liberty, its programming affiliate, also owns cable television systems and provides satellite-delivered programming services to various distribution media, including cable television.  Together, the companies' affiliated cable systems control distribution of cable programming to approximately 25% of the total cable television subscriber base in the U.S.  In addition to their operations, TCI and Liberty hold substantial stock ownership in many popular cable television programming networks, including QVC.  Paramount is a major Hollywood studio that produces and licenses new theatrically released movies for transmission on cable television channels and owns a 50% interest in USA Networks.  In view of these facts, the FTC alleged that the effect of the acquisition likely would be to (1) reduce the output and quality of premium movie channels; (2) raise programming fees to cable operators; (3) raise cable television subscriber fees to consumers; (4) enhance coordinated interaction among vertically integrated MSOs; and (5) increase the difficulty of entry into the provision of subscription television programming distribution.
<P>
	Resolving these allegations, TCI and Liberty entered into an Agreement Containing Consent Order, pursuant to which TCI and Liberty are required subject to certain exceptions to (1) divest all ownership interest in QVC and (2) divest or terminate their voting interests in QVC stock.  The companies must complete the required divestitures and/or terminations within 18 months from the date the Consent Order becomes final.  The Agreement requires that TCI and Liberty divest their interests only after obtaining FTC approval; such approval is not required where TCI or Liberty divest some or all of their ownership or voting interests to QVC or its other named owners.
<P>
	The Agreement temporarily prohibits TCI and Liberty from entering into any agreement with QVC or Paramount that grants TCI or Liberty exclusive rights to recently released motion pictures after Paramount's current contract with certain other parties terminates.  TCI and Liberty are also prohibited from acquiring, directly or indirectly, any equity or ownership interest in QVC, Paramount, or USA Networks, without the prior approval of the FTC.  This prohibition is effective for a period beginning from the date the Consent Order becomes final and ends 3 years after the required divestitures or terminations of interest are complete.
<P>
	The Agreement provides that TCI and Liberty are not obligated to comply with the Consent Order if (1) QVC terminates or abandons the attempted acquisition of Paramount or (2) QVC does not acquire more than 10% of Paramount's common stock within 12 months of the date the Consent Order becomes final.
<P>
	According to the FTC, the Agreement's purpose is to preserve competition during the period prior to the final acceptance of the consent agreement and thereafter until the divestitures and terminations required of the consent agreement are completed.  Consistent with this purpose, the Agreement prohibits TCI and Liberty from (1) exercising direction or control over the management or operations of QVC or Paramount; (2) exercising any voting rights or agreements pursuant to Liberty's ownership in QVC; or (3) participating in any change in the composition of the management of QVC or Paramount.  Additionally, the Agreement provides that within 5 days after it is placed on the public record, any officers, directors, or employees of TCI or Liberty who are present members of the Board of Directors of QVC or Paramount must resign.
<P>
	<strong>TCI/Liberty</strong>
<P>
	In a separate action that also involved TCI and Liberty, <EM>U.S. v. Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation </EM>(No. 94-0948) (D.C. Cir. April 28, 1994), the Antitrust Division filed a complaint alleging that the proposed merger of the parties would lessen competition (1) among providers of video programming to United States multichannel subscription television distributors ("MSTD") and (2) among MSTDs in those areas where TCI and Liberty control cable systems.
<P>
	According to the complaint, the merger of TCI and Liberty would result in a vertically integrated firm with the ability and incentives to restrain competition in at least two ways.  First, a merged TCI/Liberty could discriminate against competing video programmers in favor of its affiliated programmers by refusing to carry programs or by denying similar terms or conditions to its competitors.  The Division contended that such conduct could create difficulties for competing programmers to operate profitably or to compete effectively against the TCI/Liberty programming services.  Second, a merged TCI/Liberty could deny competing MSTDs access to TCI/Liberty programming or discriminate against competing MSTDs as to the terms of access.  The Division contended that competitive distribution systems would find it difficult to obtain the programming necessary to compete effectively against TCI/Liberty's MSTDs.
<P>
	Resolving these allegations, the parties filed a Stipulation by which they consented to entry of a proposed Final Judgment.  The Consent Judgment enjoins TCI/Liberty from discriminating against unaffiliated video programmers in the selection, terms, or conditions of carriage of video programming offered by TCI/Liberty cable systems or MSTDs.  It also enjoins TCI/Liberty from refusing to sell or license to any competing MSTD, or from selling or licensing only on a discriminatory basis, video programming in which the firm has an interest.  The prohibitions apply where "the effect of such discrimination is to unreasonably restrain competition."  The Consent Judgment extends the prohibitions to prevent TCI and Liberty from seeking or supporting, with respect to any MSTD or video programming provider in which they have a financial interest but do not control, conduct that would violate the provisions if engaged in by the companies.
<P>
	The Consent Judgment will remain in effect for a term of 5 years.  According to the Antitrust Division, "[t]he length of this term reflects the Department's recognition that this industry is one that has experienced major changes in MSTD technologies that are on-going, and the effects of the 1992 Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations."  
<P>
	<strong>BT/MCI</strong>
<P>
	In <EM>United States v. MCI Communications Corp.,</EM> No. 94-01317 (D.D.C. June 15, 1994), the Antitrust Division filed a complaint against MCI and BT Forty-Company alleging that the proposed acquisition of a 20% equity interest in MCI by British Telecommunications plc ("BT"), and the proposed formation of a joint venture between MCI and BT (the "Joint Venture") to provide international enhanced telecommunications services would violate antitrust laws by reducing competition in the markets for international telecommunications services between the United States and the United Kingdom and for global seamless telecommunications services.  According to the complaint, BT and MCI are, respectively, the fourth and fifth largest providers of telecommunications in the world.  MCI also carries approximately 20% of the United States international traffic to and from the United Kingdom.  The complaint alleged that BT's investment in MCI and the Joint Venture would likely increase BT's incentive and ability to:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	use its market power in the provision of local and domestic and international long distance telecommunications services in the United Kingdom to discriminate in favor of MCI and the Joint Venture against other United States international telecommunications and enhanced telecommunications providers;
<LI>	provide to MCI and the Joint Venture confidential, competitively sensitive information obtained from MCI's and the Joint Venture's United States competitors through their correspondent relationships or their interconnection with BT, substantially lessening competition in the United States; and
<LI>	favor MCI over its competitors in the allocation of international telecommunications traffic from the United Kingdom. 
</OL>
<P>
	Resolving these concerns, the parties filed a Stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment that contains the following substantive requirements meant to "diminish the risk of abuse of BT's market power to discriminate or otherwise afford anticompetitive advantages to MCI and [the Joint Venture]."  
<P>
	1.  <strong>Transparency Requirements.  </strong>Under the terms of the Consent Judgment, MCI and the Joint Venture are required to provide information to the Justice Department on (a) prices, terms and conditions, including discounts, on which telecommunications services are provided to the Joint Venture pursuant to interconnection agreements with BT; (b) MCI minutes to and from BT in each rate category; (c) schedules of facilities and circuits, including capacity, provided by BT and actual and average time intervals between fault report and restoration of service circuits; and (d) planned and authorized changes in BT's United Kingdom public network that would affect interconnection arrangements with any licensed operators.
<P>
	To ensure greater transparency in MCI's dealings with BT, the Consent Judgment also contains disclosure obligations specifically applicable to MCI.  Pursuant to such provisions, MCI must disclose the following information with regard to international switched and enhanced telecommunications: (a) accounting and settlement rates and other terms and conditions for the provision of services; (b) on an annual basis, minutes of traffic to and from BT for each accounting rate, for calculating proportionate return; and (c) for international private circuits it provides jointly with BT, the actual number of outages and actual average time intervals between fault report and restoration of service, average number of circuit equivalents available to MCI during certain hours.
<P>
	In connection with the transparency requirements, the Consent Judgment provides that the information submitted by MCI and the Joint Venture to the Justice Department may be disclosed to any United States corporation that holds or has applied for a license from either the United States or United Kingdom authorities to provide international telecommunications services between the United States and the United Kingdom.  According to the Antitrust Division, "this will enable the principal competitors of MCI and the Joint Venture to monitor whether either of these companies is receiving discriminatory treatment in their favor from BT, and provide them with evidence that could be used to make a complaint to any governmental authorities in the United States or the United Kingdom."
<P>
	2.  <strong>Confidentiality Requirements.  </strong>The Consent Judgment contains certain confidentiality requirements necessitated by what the Antitrust Division considered to be the inadequate protection provided by existing regulations.  Specifically, the Consent Judgment provides that BT may not provide to MCI or the Joint Venture (a) any data proprietary to other United States carriers; (b) any confidential, non-public data from other carriers; and (c) any non-public data about future prices or plans of other carriers.
<P>
	3.  <strong>International Simple Resale Requirements.  </strong>To prevent discrimination by BT in favor of MCI, including the diversion of BT's traffic from the United Kingdom through MCI and the Joint Venture, the Consent Judgment prohibits MCI and the Joint Venture from providing international simple resale between the United States and the United Kingdom until the United Kingdom permits simple resale by United States carriers from the United Kingdom and those carriers are able to interconnect with BT on "standard, nondiscriminatory terms."
<P>
	The Consent Judgment provides for modification of its terms upon a showing of changed circumstances or public interest.  Violations of the Consent Judgment subject the parties to civil penalties of up to $10 million.  The Consent Judgment expires by its terms after five years.  
<P>
	<strong>Martin Marietta/General Dynamics</strong>
<P>
	In <EM>In the Matter of Martin Marietta Corporation, </EM>FTC Docket No. C-3500 (June 22, 1994), the FTC challenged the proposed acquisition of General Dynamics' Space Systems Division by Martin Marietta.  The allegations of the complaint were as follows:  Martin is a significant competitor in the market for the manufacture and sale of satellites, and GD is a manufacturer of Atlas expendable launch vehicles ("ELV"), which are used to transport satellites into orbit.  The proposed acquisition would allow Martin, in its capacity as an ELV manufacturer, access to competitively significant and non-public information concerning other satellite suppliers' products.  Such access would decrease competition between satellite suppliers and reduce advancements in satellite research, innovation, and quality.  
<P>
	Resolving these allegations, Martin agreed to a Consent Order under which it would be prohibited from disclosing any non-public information received from satellite owners or manufacturers in its capacity as a provider of ELVs and is required to use such information only as a provider of ELVs.  Non-public information is defined in the Order as any information not in the public domain which is furnished by a satellite owner or manufacturer to Martin or GD in their capacity as providers of ELVs and is designated as proprietary.
<P>
	Martin is required to deliver a copy of the Consent Order to any United States satellite owner or manufacturer prior to obtaining any information that is outside the public domain.  One year from the date the Consent Order becomes final and annually thereafter for 9 years, Martin would also be required to provide to the FTC a report of its compliance.
<P>
	<strong>AT&T/McCaw</strong>
<P>
	In <EM>United States v. AT&T Corp.</EM>, No. 94-01555 (HHG) (D.D.C. July 15, 1994), the Antitrust Division filed a complaint against AT&T and McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc. alleging that their proposed merger would violate antitrust laws by reducing competition in United States markets for cellular service, cellular infrastructure equipment and long-distance services to cellular customers.  According to the complaint, AT&T is the dominant supplier of long-distance services to both landline and cellular customers and the largest supplier of cellular infrastructure equipment in the United States, and McCaw is the largest provider of cellular services in the United States and a major supplier of long-distance services to cellular customers in many domestic markets.  Consequently, the complaint alleged, the merger would likely 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	increase AT&T's incentive and ability to disadvantage its "locked in" equipment customers that currently compete against McCaw in the provision of cellular services,
<LI>	provide AT&T with access to competitively sensitive information that McCaw obtains from its cellular infrastructure equipment supplier that currently competes with AT&T, and
<LI>	reduce competition in the provision of long-distance services to cellular customers.

</OL>
<P>
	Resolving these concerns, the parties filed a Stipulation consenting to entry of a proposed Final Judgment that contains, among other provisions, the following:
<P>
	1.  <strong>Separation of AT&T and McCaw.  </strong>McCaw and its affiliates involved in wireless services must operate separately from AT&T for the Consent Judgment's term (i.e., 10 years).  While McCaw may use the name "AT&T" or any trademark or trade name of AT&T in its corporate or service names, it may do so only after it has (a) completed conversion to equal access and (b) balloted existing customers regarding their preference among long-distance carriers.  Additionally, the defendants may not use the name "AT&T" or any trademark or trade name of AT&T in the national marketing or advertising of any cellular service until 60% of McCaw cellular systems have been converted to equal access.
<P>
	2.  <strong>Equal Access.  </strong>Within 21 months following the filing of the complaint, McCaw must provide competing long-distance carriers with equal access to its cellular subscribers.  Such access requires that McCaw (a) allow new and existing customers to designate the long-distance carrier of their choice and (b) provide complete lists of its cellular service customers to unaffiliated long-distance carriers for use in marketing their services to McCaw customers.  After its conversion to equal access, McCaw must provide all long-distance carriers access to its services on an unbundled basis that is equal in type, quality, and price to that provided to AT&T.  The Consent Judgment prohibits McCaw from discriminating in favor of AT&T in (a) the provision of technical or other information about its cellular system or customers; (b) the interconnection or use of its services, facilities, or charges for each element of service; or (c) the provision of exchange access services.
<P>
	3.  <strong>Manufacturing.  </strong>The Consent Judgment prohibits the Defendants from disclosing confidential information relating to each other or third parties obtained through the Defendants' provision of equipment or services.  The Consent Judgment addresses the issue of "lock-in" by allowing AT&T's cellular equipment customers to sell back their equipment to AT&T, under certain circumstances, at cost minus a reasonable allowance for depreciation.  In addition, AT&T is required to provide technical assistance to facilitate the use of AT&T equipment with that of other manufacturers.
<P>
	To ensure compliance with the terms of the Consent Judgment, AT&T and/or McCaw are required to file implementation plans for each of the above provisions with the Antitrust Division no later than 90 days after the Judgment's entry.  These plans are to be effective 90 days after their submission.  Additionally, the Defendants are required to advise their management personnel of the obligations imposed by the judgment and to obtain certificates from each such employee acknowledging the Judgment's terms.
<P>
	The Consent Judgment shall expire by its terms ten years after the date of entry.  Until then, if BOC cellular systems receive relief from equal access or nondiscrimination provisions of the MFJ, the Consent Judgment shall be modified or vacated to provide AT&T or McCaw with the same relief upon a showing that competitive conditions do not require a different obligation and that the obligation is equitable and in the public interest.  In addition, upon a showing that certain types of services have developed as effective competitive alternatives to cellular services or that other changes or developments affect a relevant market, the Consent Judgment shall be modified if its provisions are inequitable, irrespective of whether the intervening changes or developments were foreseen or foreseeable.
<P>
	The Division had foretold its views of the merger in response to an earlier motion brought by AT&T with regard to the MFJ.  AT&T had sought to modify Section I(D) of the MFJ, which prohibited AT&T from acquiring stock or assets of any Bell Operating Company ("BOC"), a term arguably defined in a manner that reached McCaw.  In a memorandum supporting AT&T's motion after earlier procedural jockeying, the Antitrust Division framed the issue at hand as whether AT&T's acquisition of BOC cellular systems currently providing equal access would (1) reduce competition by threatening the equal access provided by those systems or (2) otherwise frustrate the objective of the MFJ.  <EM>See </EM>Memorandum of the United States In Support of AT&T's Motion for a Waiver of Section I(D) of the Decree, <EM>Western Electric Co.</EM> (No. 82-0192) (D.C. Cir. July 15, 1994).  According to the Memorandum, any concerns in that regard could be resolved through appropriate safeguards to protect equal access.  The Division conditioned its support of AT&T's motion to entry of a proposed order that would require AT&T and McCaw to use their ownership interest in BOC cellular systems to reinforce the requirements of equal access.
<P>
	<strong>U S West/TimeWarner</strong>
<P>
	In another matter arising from the MFJ, U S West filed a motion for waiver of the line of business restrictions under Section II(D).  U S West sought the waiver to enable it to engage solely through its affiliate, Time Warner Entertainment, in certain interexchange telecommunications and manufacturing activities from which TimeWarner would otherwise be barred as an affiliate of U S West.  As with <EM>AT&T/McCaw</EM>, this motion was granted by the court with the support of the Antitrust Division, subject to certain conditions.
<P>
	Pursuant to the Waiver issued in this case, TimeWarner may, subject to certain limitations, enter six market categories from which it was previously barred.  First, TimeWarner may provide local cable distribution services that would use receive-only interexchange facilities and would cross LATA boundaries to a limited extent for both one- and two-way telecommunications services.  TimeWarner is required, however, to remain a separate legal entity from U S West, with U S West holding no more than a minority noncontrolling interest in the company.  Additionally, the Waiver prohibits TimeWarner from selecting interLATA transmission facilities to be used to deliver programming for an unaffiliated programmer.
<P>
	Second, TimeWarner may provide one-way transmissions of video and audio programming signals across LATA boundaries, but only to a limited extent.  The Waiver generally excludes from relief two-way transmissions of voice or data, as well as one-way transmission for entities unaffiliated with U S West, and prohibits U S West from discriminating between TimeWarner and any other person in providing exchange or exchange access services.
<P>
	Third, TimeWarner may provide both one-way and two-way video, data, voice and other telecommunications services across LATA boundaries, but only between points in a cable system that satisfy a number of conditions enumerated in the Waiver.  With respect to any two-way services provided in these cable systems, the Waiver also imposes certain equal access conditions. 
<P>
	Fourth, the Waiver authorizes TimeWarner to provide information services used in cable systems to customers in one LATA from an information storage or processing facility in another.  These services, however, may only be provided by means of interexchange services obtained from an unaffiliated interexchange carrier, and may not include TimeWarner's use of any exchange or exchange access services or facilities provided by U S West.  Additionally, the Waiver (1) prohibits billing of a separate charge for an interexchange call unless the customer selects the carrier; (2) requires that the bundled charges on an aggregated basis for each functionally different or separate interexchange information service be at least 175% of the charge for the interexchange services obtained from the unaffiliated carrier; and (3) states that the information services cannot be the functional equivalent of real time voice or data transmission services.
<P>
	Fifth, the Waiver permits TimeWarner to manufacture various types of customer premises equipment and multimedia storage and retrieval equipment, other than that used for voice telephony.  In connection with this provision, however, the Waiver imposes several restrictions on U S West's relationship with TimeWarner's manufacturing activities.  
<P>
	Sixth, the Waiver allows TimeWarner to own and operate television and radio broadcast stations that transmit one-way video and audio programming signals across LATA boundaries by means of terrestrial broadcast facilities.  
  <P>
	In supporting the motion, the Division noted in particular that (1) the proposed Waiver is limited to TimeWarner activities in which U S West has only a minority interest, (2) the authorizations provided by the Waiver with regard to cable television systems engaged in interexchange activities apply only to those systems outside of U S West's telephone service region, and (3) U S West and TimeWarner have committed to the FCC to divest TimeWarner's cable systems within the U S West region within 18 months following the acquisition.  According to the Division, however, direct entry by the Regional Bell Operating Companies or majority-owned affiliates into these markets, or entry through minority-owned affiliates without the same safeguards may present substantially different competitive issues.  See Response of the United States to US West's Motion for a Waiver of the Decree to Permit U S West, Inc., Through its Minority Partnership Investment in Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P., to Provide Limited Interlata Services and Engage in Limited Manufacturing Activities, <EM>Western Electric Co. </EM>(No. 82-0192) (D.C. Cir. Sept. 27, 1994).   
<P>
	<strong>Lilly/PCS</strong>
<P>
	<EM>In the Matter of Eli Lilly and Company, Inc., </EM>FTC File No. 941-0102 (Oct. 26, 1994), relates to the acquisition of McKesson Corporation by Eli Lilly.  Lilly is a leading producer of pharmaceutical products, including Prozac, an antidepressant; Ceclor, an oral antibiotic; Axid, and anti-ulcer drug; and Humulin, an injectable insulin.  McKesson, through its subsidiary PCS Health Systems, Inc. ("PCS"), provides pharmacy-benefit management ("PBM") services to insurance companies, third-party payors, and other members of the healthcare industry.  According to the complaint, Lilly's acquisition of McKesson and PCS could reduce competition in violation of antitrust laws at two levels of the pharmaceutical industry: (1) the provision of PBM services by national, full-service firms, and (2) the development, manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals of certain therapeutic types.
<P>
	Specifically, as described in the complaint, PCS maintains a "drug formulary" -- a list of drugs it gives to pharmacies, physicians, and third-party payors to guide them in prescribing and dispensing prescriptions to health plan beneficiaries -- on which Lilly's drug products are listed.  PCS provides claims processing, drug-utilization review, and other PBM services and, according to the complaint, influences the prices and availability of pharmaceutical products under its pharmacy benefit plan.  Lilly and McKesson had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to discuss whether Lilly might close its distribution centers after the acquisition, and use McKesson as its sole distributor.
<P>
	The complaint alleged that the acquisition (1) would likely lead to the foreclosure of drugs manufactured by companies other than Lilly from the PCS formulary; (2) would enhance the chances for collusion and other illegal anticompetitive conduct among Lilly and other vertically-integrated drug companies; (3) would eliminate PCS as an independent negotiator of pharmaceutical prices with manufacturers; (4) would reduce other manufacturers' incentives to develop innovative pharmaceuticals; (5) could make entry into the relevant markets more difficult, because companies will be required to enter at more than one market level; and (6) could reduce competition among drug wholesalers, because the competitive advantage that control over Lilly drugs will give McKesson.
<P>
	Resolving the allegations, Lilly agreed to a Consent Order requiring the company to ensure that PCS maintain an "open formulary."  Lilly must appoint an independent "Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee" of health care professionals, a majority of whom are unaffiliated with Lilly or PCS, to objectively evaluate drugs for inclusion in the PCS formulary.  As contemplated by the Consent Order, only independent members may cast a vote on P&T Committee decisions.
<P>
	The Consent Order also requires Lilly to ensure that PCS accepts all discounts, rebates, or other concessions offered by Lilly's competitors for drugs that are listed on the formulary and to accurately reflect such discounts in ranking the drugs on the formulary.  Moreover, PCS and Lilly are prohibited from sharing proprietary or other non-public information (e.g., price data) from competitors whose drugs may be placed on a PCS formulary.
<P>
	The Consent Order contains provisions which require Lilly, for a period of five years from the date the Order becomes final, to obtain FTC approval before acquiring an interest in any firm that provides formulary services to more than 2 million people within the U.S.  This five-year prior approval requirement also applies to any exclusive distribution agreement between Lilly and McKesson or any other pharmaceutical wholesaler that would distribute Lilly pharmaceutical products.  Finally, the Consent Order contains various reporting provisions to assist the FTC in monitoring Lilly's compliance.

	<strong>Hercules/Alliant</strong>
<P>
	<EM>In the Matter of Alliant Techsystems Inc., </EM>FTC File No. 941-0123 (Nov. 16, 1994), arose from the proposed acquisition of substantially all of the stock and assets of Hercules Aerospace Company by Alliant.  Alliant is a significant competitor in the market for ammunition and munitions, and Hercules is the only United States supplier of propellant used in large caliber ammunition.  According to the complaint, the transaction would allow Alliant's ammunition and munitions division to gain access to competitively significant and non-public information concerning other ammunition and munitions suppliers' products through its new role as a supplier of propellant.  Consequently, the complaint alleged, (1) the acquisition would increase the likelihood that competition between ammunition and munitions suppliers would decrease and (2) advancements in ammunition and munitions research, innovation, and quality would be reduced.  
<P>
	Resolving these concerns, Alliant agreed to a Consent Order under which its  ammunition and munitions division would be prohibited from certain activities.  In particular, the Consent Order prohibits Alliant from disclosing to its ammunition or munitions division any non-public information received in its capacity as a provider of propellant from ammunition or munitions manufacturers.  Alliant is required to use such information only in its capacity as a provider of propellant.  Non-public information is defined in the Consent Order as any information not in the public domain which is furnished by an ammunition or munitions manufacturer to Alliant's propellant division and is designated as proprietary.
<P>
	The Consent Order also requires Alliant to deliver a copy of the Order to any domestic propellant customers prior to obtaining from them any non-public information.  One year from the date the Consent Order becomes final, and annually thereafter for 9 years, Alliant is required to submit to the Commission a report of its compliance with the terms of the Order.
<P>
	<strong>Lockheed/Martin Marietta</strong>
<P>
	<EM>In the Matter of Lockheed Corporation, </EM>FTC File No. 941-0005 (Jan. 13, 1995), arose from the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization entered into by Lockheed and Martin Marietta Corporation whereby the companies agreed to merge their businesses into a newly created corporation, Lockheed Martin.  According to the complaint, Lockheed and Martin compete in the research, development, manufacture, and sale of satellites and expendable satellite launch vehicles.  Lockheed and Martin also have exclusive teaming arrangements, respectively, with Hughes Aircraft Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. to develop and manufacture satellites for use in space-based early warning systems.  Hughes and Northrop are two of the leading producers of electro-optical sensors for use in military satellites.  Under the companies' teaming arrangements, Hughes and Northrop are barred from bidding on their own or teaming with other firms to bid on Defense Department contracts for space-based early warning systems.  Accordingly, the complaint alleged, the merger would enable Lockheed Martin to tie up two of the leading producers of sensors for space-based early warning systems.
<P>
	The complaint also alleged that the merger would increase the vertical integration in the markets for satellites and expendable launch vehicles ("ELV").  If Lockheed Martin were to launch its satellites on vehicles supplied by its competitors, the merged entity's satellite divisions would obtain proprietary information about these vehicles and would, itself, be able to adjust its prices and services accordingly.  Additionally, the complaint alleged, advancements in ELV research, innovation, and quality would suffer because Lockheed Martin's competitors would fear that the company could "free ride" on their technological developments.
<P>
	With regard to the military aircraft market, the complaint alleged that Martin is the sole manufacturer of the LANTIRN infrared navigation device used in military aircraft and, as such, obtains proprietary information from the aircraft manufacturers who use the device.  Because Lockheed is a significant competitor in the military aircraft market, the complaint alleged that the merged entity's military aircraft division could gain access to its competitors' proprietary data and use that data to determine its own prices and services.  In this way, the merger would raise the same "free rider" problems in the military aircraft market that it would in the markets for satellites and ELVs.  Furthermore, the complaint alleged, Lockheed Martin could modify the LANTIRN in a manner that discriminates against its military aircraft competitors.
<P>
	Resolving these concerns, Lockheed and Martin agreed to a Consent Order under which Lockheed Martin would be prohibited from certain activities.  The Consent Order bars Lockheed Martin from enforcing the exclusivity provision in the teaming agreements; this enables Hughes and Northrop to bid on providing space-based early warning systems to the Defense Department either on their own or in teaming arrangements with other companies.
<P>
	The Consent Order also prohibits Lockheed Martin from gaining access to certain non-public information about its competitors through its satellite and LANTIRN system divisions.  Specifically, the Consent Order prohibits the company from gaining access through its satellite division to information about its competitors' launch vehicles when launching Lockheed Martin satellites on their vehicles.  The Consent Order also bars Lockheed Martin's military aircraft division from gaining access to information not otherwise publicly available about its competitors' military aircraft when providing competitors with the LANTIRN system.  Finally, the Consent Order prohibits Lockheed Martin from modifying the system in such a way as to discriminate against competing military aircraft producers, unless such modifications are sanctioned by the Secretary of Defense or are necessary to meet competitors' technological advancements.

<P>
<H4>Commentary</H4>
<P>
	The wave of recent enforcement activity raises numerous policy issues.  We discuss several important ones here.
<P>
	<strong>The General Attitude towards Vertical Mergers</strong>
<P>
	Enforcement officials, scholars, and others who have considered vertical mergers agree widely on two propositions:  (1) vertical mergers can yield substantial efficiencies, and (2) vertical mergers can result in anticompetitive effects, at least in limited circumstances.  The central problem in framing rules of law with respect to vertical mergers is to balance the conflicting policy implications of those two propositions, and to do so in a manner that does not impose exorbitant transactions costs on private parties and enforcement officials.  The enforcement practices that prevailed through the 1980s and into 1993 reflected an underlying judgment that the prospective anticompetitive effects from vertical mergers would arise so rarely or to such a limited degree, or that the prospective efficiencies from vertical mergers were so overwhelming, that the allocation of resources to identify and challenge adverse transactions was unjustified.  The recent enforcement wave reflects a fundamental rethinking of that earlier assessment.
<P>
	The sources of prospective efficiencies seem to be widely accepted.  According to one commentary,
<P>
	Firms vertically integrate for a variety of reasons, the most common being: (1) to reduce uncertainty over the availability or quality of supplies or the demand for output; (2) to take advantage of available economies of integration that result from eliminating the "middleman"; (3) to protect against monopolistic or oligopolistic behavior of either suppliers or buyers with whom the firm must otherwise deal; and (4) to reduce transactions costs (including sales taxes, marketing expenditures, and the monitoring of contractual performance and externalities, such as "free-rider" problems in connection with point-of-sale services.  Each of these reasons can be procompetitive.  Each may lower the cost of production and distribution to the surviving firm, possibly benefitting consumers in the form of lower resources and, in any event, making more productive use of resources.
<P>
<EM>Non-Horizontal Mergers: Law and Policy, supra, </EM>at 8 (footnotes omitted).  Commentators disagree as to the magnitude of such efficiencies.
<P>
	Similarly, certain sources of prospective anticompetitive effect also seem to be widely accepted; most commentators regard the theories expressed in the <EM>1984 </EM><EM>Merger Guidelines </EM>as valid.  There is disagreement, however, as to the frequency with which the factual basis for invoking such theories is found in the real world.  
<P>
	Some commentators, particularly those applying tools of game theory, also would go beyond the Guidelines and recognize additional theories of anticompetitive effect.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>Michael H. Riordan and Steven C. Salop, <EM>Evaluating Vertical Mergers: A Post-Chicago Approach, </EM>63 <EM>Antitrust L.J. </EM>513 (1995) (modifying foreclosure theory to take account of raising rivals' costs).  Other commentators, however, question whether such theories are robust and suggest that it may be premature to rely upon them as a basis for legal rules.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>B. Douglas Bernheim and Robert D. Willig, <EM>Economic Foundations for Vertical Merger Guidelines, </EM>in Course Materials, "Post-Chicago Economics: New Theories -- New Cases?" (Georgetown University Law Center May 1994).  The expansionist view clearly has caught the attention of the enforcement agencies.  <EM>See, e.g., FTC Vertical Enforcement: What's New in RPM and Vertical Mergers, </EM>Prepared Remarks of Mary Lou Steptoe, Acting Director, FTC Bureau of Competition, before the ABA Section of Antitrust Law Program on Distribution Issues (Nov. 4, 1994), at 21-22 (favorably citing Riordan and Salop article).  
<P>
	<strong>The Theories of Adverse Competitive Effect
</strong><P>
	The two main traditional theories of challenge to vertical mergers derived from cases such as <EM>Brown Shoe </EM>and <EM>Ford (Autolite)</EM>: (1) that the merger might foreclose access to customers or (2) that the merger might foreclose access to inputs.  These theories lay dormant for many years; and they were not explicitly recognized in the <EM>1984 Merger Guidelines, </EM>which sanctioned three different theories of challenge, <EM>See generally </EM><EM>supra.  </EM>They were resuscitated, however, in 1994:  the analysis of the long distance market in AT&T/McCaw largely reflected a customer foreclosure theory, and the analysis in <EM>TCI/Liberty </EM>largely reflected an input foreclosure theory.
<P>
	But the recent enforcement actions go considerably beyond the theories found in either the case law or the <EM>1984 Merger Guidelines </EM>in several important respects.  First, they extend beyond inputs and customers to reach complementary products.  <EM>Martin Marietta/General Dynamics </EM>provides an example.  Second and more generally, the actions extend beyond foreclosure (whether of customers, inputs, or complements) to reach discrimination.  Under the theories, even if competitors are not foreclosed, the vertically integrated firm's discrimination in one market might competitively disadvantage rivals in an adjacent market.  <EM>BT/MCI </EM>and the equipment market in <EM>AT&T/McCaw </EM>provide examples.  Third, the actions extend to possible misuse of information obtained from customers or suppliers in one market who are competitors in an adjacent market.  The spate of "firewall" cases -- <EM>Martin Marietta/General Dynamics, AT&T/McCaw, Lilly/PCS, Hercules/Alliant Lockheed/Martin Marietta -- </EM>provide examples.
<P>
	The extension from inputs to complements is easiest to explain and justify.  Inputs and complements are analytically similar, and market power in one has similar effects to market power in the other.  To take one illustration, competition in the market in assembled computer hardware could be affected as readily by power in software (a complement) as by power in chips (an input).
<P>
	The extension from foreclosure to discrimination is more noteworthy and significant, and one is not sure what to make of it.  First, the recent actions that are concerned with discrimination have different attitudes and remedies.  <EM>AT&T/McCaw, </EM>for example, requires equal access and prohibits discrimination.  <EM>Lilly/PCS, </EM>by contrast, contemplates that discrimination will be necessary to attain the transaction's procompetitive efficiencies, but it seeks to regulate the manner in which the discrimination will be exercised.  Second, at roughly the same time that the enforcement agencies were pressing for consent order provisions limiting discrimination, they were challenging private contract provisions that had similar purposes.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement, <EM>United States v. Delta Dental Plan of Arizona,</EM>  59 Fed. Reg. 47349 (Sept. 15, 1994) (consent order barring most-favored-nation clause, under which dominant dental insurer would have received the lowest price charged by the provider to any patient or competing dental plan); Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement, <EM>United States v. Vision Service Plan,</EM> 60 Fed. Reg. 5210 (Jan. 26, 1995) (consent order barring most-favored-nation clause in agreements of national vision plan insurer).  Perhaps the lesson is that provisions limiting discrimination must arise from public regulation, not private contract.  Or perhaps the lesson is that leading firms cannot discriminate against others, but must suffer discrimination directed against themselves.  (But if the latter is the case, why do some of the complaints lack allegations of market power?) The ambiguity and confusion over the treatment of discrimination is nothing new, of course  -- as seen in the history of Robinson-Patman enforcement and policy, antitrust has long had a schizoid view towards discrimination.
<P>
	The other new theory of vertical challenge -- anticompetitive information transfer to be remedied through firewalls -- also holds significant policy intrigue.  First, it is difficult to characterize the theory as an extension of any of the historical theories of challenge.  The closest prior theory is probably the section of the <EM>1984 Merger Guidelines </EM>relating to monitoring of prices at the retail level, but that theory seems fundamentally different, limited as it is to horizontal effects and consumer products.  Second, the mechanism by which information transfer will have adverse competitive effect is unclear.  Would the vertically integrated firm use the newly-acquired proprietary information of its rival to predate against the rival?  Or would the vertically integrated firm use the information to elevate prices artificially in tacit horizontal collusion with the rival?  Viewed ex ante, one scenario seems as likely as the other; it is far from clear, however, that the first scenario (excessive rivalry) involves an interest deserving of antitrust protection.  Third, there is some question as to whether the protections afforded by consent order are necessary.  Private firms enter into confidentiality agreements all the time.  Unless the market power involved in the transaction is overwhelming, one would expect rival/customers or rival/suppliers to impose their own restrictions on information transfer as a condition of dealing with the vertically integrated firm.  One FTC Commissioner thoughtfully raised the same question in dissenting from <EM>Martin Marietta/General Dynamics.  See </EM>Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen on Proposed Consent Agreement with Martin Marietta Corp., File No. 941-0038  ("Vertical integration, and combinations designed to achieve the efficiencies of such integration, are common phenomena, particularly in the aerospace industry.  Accordingly, it would seem that there are already ample opportunities for the sort of abuse of information-sharing which concerns the Commission.  However, equally common are contractual obligations between vertically integrated companies, and firms that do business with one of their divisions, to prevent the sharing of those firms' confidential business information with other parts of the conglomerate with which they compete.")
<P>
	<strong>Important Procedural Considerations</strong>
<P>
	The consent settlements resolving the various vertical enforcement actions have several important procedural aspects that warrant mention.
<P>
	First, it should be underscored that all of the Orders and Judgments in the current enforcement wave are <EM>consent </EM>resolutions.  The attitude of the courts towards vertical mergers remains untested, and the willingness of the courts to adopt some of the more novel theories being advanced by the enforcement agencies in the current wave is far from clear.  Regrettably, until the courts are heard on these issues, the enforcement agencies are likely to persevere in researching the law by reading their own releases.
<P>
	Second, the consent settlements are behavioral, not structural, in nature.  Unlike the typical horizontal merger consent order, which addresses competitive concerns by structuring a limited, one-time divestiture (perhaps with ancillary requirements or fencing-in provisions), the typical vertical merger consent order is proving to address competitive concerns by regulating the vertically integrated firm's conduct on an ongoing basis.  This has two immediate implications: (a) the consent settlements frequently contain provisions that are highly regulatory in nature, and (b) the enforcement agencies almost certainly will have an unusually active monitoring role and will sometimes be cast in the role of industry regulator.  The most striking example is <EM>BT/MCI, </EM>in which the Antitrust Division has elected to become the conduit by which information is circulated through the industry.
<P>
	Third, because the consent settlements impose ongoing restrictions on the manner in which the defendant(s) or respondent(s) conduct business, the duration of the Order or Judgment has greater significance than in the usual merger matter.  Some of the Orders and Judgments, particularly those in industries in which competitive conditions are rapidly evolving, provide for quick expiration.  <EM>BT/MCI </EM>is a five-year decree.  <EM>AT&T/McCaw </EM>and <EM>Lilly/PCS </EM>are ten-year decrees.  (Dissenting from <EM>Lilly/PCS, </EM>one Commissioner complained that "there is no justification for making the duration of the order half that of other Commission orders." Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga.)
<P>
	Fourth and related, the anticipation of changed competitive conditions has caused the parties in some instances to include non-standard modification provisions.  The most noteworthy is in <EM>AT&T/McCaw.  </EM>At least two factors -- the auctioning of spectrum that will be used for new technology that will compete with cellular service, and the possibility of fundamental change in the MFJ, through either legislation or other means -- make changed conditions of law and fact foreseeable within the term of the Consent Judgment.  Under traditional standards, if changed conditions are foreseeable when a consent order is under negotiation, the changes cannot be considered as justifications supporting modification.  
<P><EM>See </EM><EM>United States v. Swift & Co.</EM>, 286 U.S. 106, 119 (1932) ("Nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to change what was decreed after years of litigation with the consent of all concerned").  The <EM>Swift </EM>standard has been relaxed in recent years, <EM>see </EM><EM>Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail</EM>, 112 S. Ct. 748, 760 (1992) (revision of decree warranted by "significant change in factual conditions or in law" or when "enforcement of the decree without modification would be detrimental to the public interest"); <EM>United States v. Western Electric Co</EM>., 154 F.R.D. 1, 78 (D.D.C. 1994) (decision arising from <EM>AT&T/McCaw </EM>determining "not without considerable hesititation" that <EM>Rufo, </EM>not <EM>Swift, </EM>is correct standard for evaluating contested modification petitions).  The modification standard in the <EM>AT&T/McCaw </EM>Consent Judgment is drafted so as to permit modifications more readily than under either a <EM>Swift </EM>standard or a <EM>Rufo </EM>standard.<P>

<p>
The antitrust laws of the United States apply in general terms to business abroad, but the specifics of their application present numerous special issues.  The first family of issues relates to United States jurisdiction over extraterritorial conduct.  The second family of issues relates to exemptions, defenses, and immunities arising from national policies that may be in conflict with the policies underlying the antitrust laws.  Other families of issues relate to discovery, remedies, and relief.  
<P>
This paper is intended to provide a brief summary of basic principles in the field.  For more detailed treatment the reader may wish to consult the following sources: 2 ABA Antitrust Section, <EM>Antitrust Law Developments </EM>(3d ed. 1992) [hereinafter <EM>Antitrust Law Developments</EM>]; 1 Phillip E. Areeda & Donald F. Turner, <EM>Antitrust Law</EM> (1978); James R. Atwood & Kingman Brewster, <EM>Antitrust and American Business Abroad</EM> (2d ed. 1981); Barry E. Hawk, United States, <EM>Common Market and International Antitrust: A Comparative Guide </EM>(1994 supp.); U.S. Department of Justice & Federal Trade Commission, <EM>Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations</EM> (1995) [hereinafter <EM>Federal Guidelines</EM>].
<P>
<H3>I. Extraterritorial Application of the Antitrust Laws</H3>
<P>
The reach of the United States antitrust laws is not limited to conduct that occurs within the territorial boundaries of the United States.  As a general jurisdictional principle, the United States antitrust laws reach conduct that affects the domestic or foreign commerce of the United States, regardless of the location of the conduct or the nationality of the participants.   The specifics depend on the particular antitrust statute involved.  In the discussion that follows, we consider subject matter jurisdiction first under the Sherman Act and then under certain other antitrust statutes -- the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Clayton Act, and the Robinson-Patman Act.  We then turn to the  related issues of venue, personal jurisdiction, and service of process.
<P>
<STRONG>A.  Sherman Act</STRONG>
<P>
The Sherman Act proscribes anticompetitive contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce, 15 U.S.C.  1, and monopolization or attempts to monopolize trade or commerce, id.  2, "among the several states or with foreign nations."
<P>
<STRONG>1.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction
</STRONG><P>
Anticompetitive conduct may violate the Sherman Act regardless of where the conduct occurs or the nationalities of the persons involved.  Federal Guidelines   3.1.  As a general matter, an "effects" test is used to determine subject matter jurisdiction over the conduct in question.  See, e.g., <EM>United Phosphorous, Ltd. v. Angus Chemical Co.</EM>, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14786 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 13, 1994) (collecting authority and stating "conduct on American soil is not always sufficient to prove effect on domestic commerce because it is the situs of the effect, not the conduct, which is crucial").  This effects test takes similar, but slightly different forms depending on whether it is being applied to import commerce or other foreign commerce. 
<P>
<EM><STRONG>Import Commerce</STRONG></EM>.   With respect to foreign import commerce, "the Sherman Act applies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the United States."  <EM>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California</EM>, 113 S.Ct. 2891, 2909 (1993).
<P>
<EM><STRONG>Other Foreign Commerce</STRONG></EM>.   The Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, codified at 15 U.S.C.  6a, governs the determination of subject matter jurisdiction with respect to foreign commerce other than imports.  The FTAIA limits subject matter jurisdiction over United States export commerce to conduct having a "direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable" effect on domestic United States commerce, on United States import trade, or on the export commerce of a person engaged in such commerce in the United States.
<P>
<STRONG>2.  Standing</STRONG>
<P>
As with any antitrust action, a plaintiff must establish valid antitrust injury.   See generally <EM>Associated General Contractors, Inc. V. California State Council of Carpenters</EM>, 459 U.S. 519 (1983); 1 <EM>Antitrust Law Developments</EM> 643-65.  In actions involving export commerce, the FTAIA limits recovery only to "injury to export business in the United States."  If the private antitrust plaintiff is not among the class of injured United States exporters, it will not have standing to bring suit.  This tends to limit the rights of foreign corporations under United States antitrust laws.
<P>
<STRONG>3.  Comity Considerations in Asserting Jurisdiction
</STRONG><P>
International comity is an extension of the principle of sovereignty,  "the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive and judicial acts of another nation."  <EM>Hilton v. Guyot</EM>, 159 U.S. 113, 164 (1895).  Courts may refrain from exercising jurisdiction over a dispute if the exercise of such jurisdiction would in some manner affect the significant interests of a foreign nation.  
<P>
In <EM>Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California</EM>, 113 S. Ct. 2891 (1993), the Supreme Court evaluated whether the district court had properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over allegedly anticompetitive conduct by foreign reinsurers in the United Kingdom.  The Court held that comity requires abstention in this context only where "there is in fact a true conflict between domestic and foreign law."  Id. at 2910  No true conflict existed in Hartford Fire because the foreign reinsurers did not face conflicting requirements under the United States and United Kingdom regulatory regimes.  The result of this holding may be that fewer courts will refuse to exercise jurisdiction on international comity grounds.
<P>
While recognizing the Supreme Court's decision in Hartford Fire, the 1995 <EM>Federal Guidelines</EM> identify various relevant factors that will be weighed by the enforcement agencies in determining whether to bring an enforcement action:  (a) the relative significance to the alleged violation of conduct within the United States as compared to conduct abroad;  (b) the nationality of the persons involved in or affected by the conduct;  (c) the presence or absence of a purpose to affect United States consumers, markets and exporters;  (d) the relative significance and foreseeability of the effects of the conduct on the United States as compared to the effects abroad;  (e) the existence of reasonable expectations that would be furthered or defeated by the action;  (f) the degree of conflict with foreign law or articulated foreign economic policies;  (g) the extent to which the enforcement activities of another country with respect to the same persons, including remedies resulting from those activities, may be affected; and  (h) the effectiveness of foreign enforcement as compared to U.S. enforcement action.  See <EM>Federal Guidelines</EM>  3.2.
<P>
"Reasonableness" tests employing similar relevant factors have been formulated by the courts, e.g., <EM>Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America National Trust & Savings Ass'n</EM>, 549 F.2d 597, 614 (9th Cir. 1976), and in the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States  403(2)  (1987).
<P>
<STRONG>B.  Related Issues under Other Antitrust Statutes
</STRONG><P>
<STRONG>1.  Federal Trade Commission Act
</STRONG><P>
The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits "[u]nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." 15 U.S.C.  45(a)(3).  The FTC Act defines the term "commerce" to mean "commerce among the several states or with foreign nations."  A 1982 amendment limited the extraterritorial reach of the FTC Act to only those unfair methods of competition that involve United States domestic and import commerce unless the methods "have a direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect" on United States domestic or import commerce or on the export commerce of a person engaged in such commerce in the United States.
<P>
<STRONG>2.  Clayton Act
</STRONG><P>
Section 1 of the Clayton Act defines commerce to include "commerce with foreign nations."  15 U.S.C.  12.  Section 3 of the Clayton Act reaches certain types of exclusive dealing relating to the sale of goods and commodities, but only when sold "for use, consumption or resale in the United States."  Id.  14.  
<P>
Section 7 of the Clayton Act applies to mergers and acquisitions between persons engaged "in commerce" or whose activities "effect commerce."  Id.  18.  Acquisitions involving foreign companies may thus be covered by this provision.  See generally ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 12, Horizontal Mergers: Law and Policy 141-42 (1986).
<P>
<STRONG>3.  Robinson-Patman Act
</STRONG><P>
The price discrimination provision of Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act applies only to transaction involving goods and commodities "for use, consumption or resale in the United States."  15 U.S.C.  13(a).  Other provisions of the Robinson-Patman Act -- Sections 2(c), (d), (e) and (f) --  contain no requirement that goods be used or resold in the United States.  See id.  13(c-f).  As such, these provisions may apply to export commerce.  See, e.g., <EM>Baysoy v. Jessup Steel Co.</EM>, 90 F. Supp. 303 (W.D. Pa. 1950).
<P>
The United States antidumping laws include prohibitions on certain types of predatory pricing by U.S. importers.  15 U.S.C.  72.  Antidumping remedies are available for relief against other types of illegal "less-than-fair-value" sales. 
<P>
<STRONG>C. Venue
</STRONG><P>
Depending on the identities of the parties, the venue provisions of the federal antitrust laws may also be material to cases involving extraterritorial conduct.   Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that private actions for treble damages may be brought in any district "in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent."  15 U.S.C.  15.  A Clayton Act suit involving a corporate defendant may be brought in the district where the defendant "is an inhabitant, but also in any district where it may be found or transacts business."  15 U.S.C.  22.  A corporate defendant is "found" if there is "proof of continuous local activities" in the district.  Such a defendant has an agent in the district if it has an employee or other representative conducting business in the district on its behalf.  Several factors relating to the defendant's contacts with a district will be evaluated by the court in determining whether a corporate defendant "transacts business" in the district.  See generally <EM>United States v. Scophony Co.</EM>, 33 U.S. 795 (1948).
<P>
The general federal venue statute may also provide a basis for determining proper venue in antitrust litigation.  28 U.S.C.  1391.  The statute makes clear that "an alien may be sued in any district." 28 U.S.C.  1391(d).  
<P>
<STRONG>D.  Personal Jurisdiction
</STRONG><P>
Personal jurisdiction in antitrust suits is determined in the same manner as other suits brought in federal court.  Thus, the "minimum contacts" and fairness/convenience test established by <EM>International Shoe Co. v. Washington</EM>, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), and its progeny apply.  Personal jurisdiction will be recognized where the defendant acts affirmatively to "purposefully avail" himself of the privilege of transacting business in the jurisdiction.  <EM>Burger King v. Rudzewicz</EM>, 471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985).
<P>
In certain antitrust cases, activities by foreigners in foreign countries that are directed towards the United States or that are designed to affect the United States may give rise to personal jurisdiction.  Consolidated Gold Fields, <EM>PLC v. Anglo American Corp</EM>., 698 F. Supp. 487 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), aff'd in part and rev'd in part sub nom. Consolidated Gold Fields, <EM>PLC v. Minorco</EM>, SA, 871 F.2d 252 (2d Cir.), cert. dismissed, 492 U.S. 939 (1989). 
<P>
<STRONG>E.  Service of Process
</STRONG><P>
Section 12 of the Clayton Act authorizes service of process on corporate defendants "in the district in which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found."  15 U.S.C.  22.  Under the Clayton Act, extraterritorial service of process is thus permitted.  See <EM>Hoffman Motors Corp. v. Alfa Romeo</EM>, SpA, 244 F. Supp. 70, 79-80 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (service on a corporation at its overseas corporate headquarters permitted).  Such service is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4.
<P>
<H3>II.     Exemptions, Defenses, and Immunities
</H3><P>

Many national policies other than antitrust relate to foreign commerce.  The various policies are not always in harmony, and in numerous instances Congress and the courts have elected to subordinate antitrust and competition considerations to other policies that are viewed as more vital.  In the discussion that follows we review a variety of exemptions, defenses, and immunities that come into play in connection with foreign commerce.
<P>
<STRONG>A.  Sovereign Immunity 
</STRONG><P>
United States courts have traditionally recognized the immunity of a foreign sovereign from suit in the United States.  See, e.g., <EM>The Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon</EM>, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 116 (1812) (Marshall, C.J.) (first recognition of doctrine before Supreme Court).  Through 1976 this principle applied to suits brought under the United States antitrust laws; and questions of sovereign immunity were commonly addressed by both the executive and judicial branches, with the views of the executive commonly regarded as binding on the courts.  See generally 2 <EM>Antitrust Law Developments</EM> 899.
<P>
With its enactment in 1976 of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C.  1602-11, Congress provided an important exception to this general principle. The Act permits antitrust and other civil actions against the instrumentalities of foreign sovereigns for conduct while engaging in commercial activities.  The FSIA is the exclusive source in the United States of subject matter jurisdiction over suits involving foreign states or instrumentalities.  Republic of <EM>Argentina v. Weltover, Inc.</EM>, 112 S.Ct. 2160, 2164 (1992).
<P>
The key distinction for purposes of the FSIA is between "commercial" activity and "governmental" activity.  Under the FSIA, a commercial activity is "either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act."  The character of the act is determined "by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose."  28 U.S.C.  1603(d).  See Weltover, 112 S.Ct. at 2166 ("when a foreign government acts, not as a regulator of a market, but in the manner of a private player within it, the foreign sovereign's actions are commercial' within the meaning of the FSIA").  In making its determination, a court will consider whether the conduct is of a type that only sovereign governments can perform.  <EM>Saudi Arabia v. Nelson</EM>, 113 S.Ct. 1471 (1993).  Interpreting the state of the law, the <EM>Federal Guidelines</EM> state at   3.31:  "As a practical matter, most activities of foreign government-owned corporations operating in the commercial marketplace will be subject to U.S. antitrust laws to the same extent as the activities of foreign privately-owned firms."
<P>
A suit subject to FSIA jurisdiction must possess a substantial United States nexus.  The suit must be based on (1) a commercial activity carried on in the United States by a foreign state or (2) an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity carried on elsewhere or (3) an act outside the United States in connection with a commercial activity provided that the act causes a "direct effect" in the U.S.  28 U.S.C.  1605(a)(3).   See <EM>United World Trade, Inc. v. Mangyshlakneft Oil Production Ass'n,</EM> 33 F.3d 1232, 1238 (10th Cir. 1994)  (in dispute involving oil transaction in Kazakhstan, contract requirement that payment be made in dollars through a United States bank insufficient to invoke jurisdiction under FSIA because "Congress did not intend to provide jurisdiction whenever the ripples caused by an overseas transaction manage eventually to reach the shores of the United States").
<P>
<STRONG>B.  Act of State
</STRONG><P>
The "act of state" doctrine is a federal common law rule that requires judicial abstention where the specific conduct complained of is a public act of the foreign sovereign within its territorial jurisdiction on matters pertaining to its governmental sovereignty.  <EM>W.S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp.</EM>, 493 U.S. 400, 409 (1990) ("The act of state doctrine . . . merely requires that . . . the acts of foreign sovereigns taken within their own jurisdictions shall be deemed valid").  Under the doctrine, courts have refused to adjudicate claims or issues that would require the court to judge the legality of the sovereign act of a foreign state.  The trend, however, is toward narrow construction and application of the doctrine.  See, e.g., <EM>Grupo Protexa, S.A. v. All American Marine Slip</EM>, 20 F.3d 1224 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 481 (1994) (examination of the validity of a Mexican decision to remove a sunken wreck from a bay off the coast of Mexico not barred by act of state doctrine).  Courts have generally held that the act of state doctrine applies only to a sovereign's public, as opposed to private or commercial acts. 
<P>
Under the <EM>Federal Guidelines</EM>  3.33, the enforcement agencies may refrain from bringing an enforcement action based on the act of state doctrine where a restraint on competition arises directly from the act of a foreign sovereign, such as the grant of a license, award of a contract, or expropriation of property.  The agencies will not challenge foreign acts of state if the facts and circumstances indicate that (1) the specific conduct complained of is a public act of a sovereign, (2) the act was taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the sovereign, and (3) the matter is governmental rather than commercial.
<P>
<STRONG>C.  Foreign Sovereign Compulsion
</STRONG><P>
Although conduct by private parties in violation of United States antitrust laws is not immunized from prosecution by virtue of having been encouraged or approved by a foreign sovereign, courts generally will not impose antitrust liability if the offending conduct results from the compulsion of a foreign government.  (This doctrine may be viewed as foreign-conduct analogue to the domestic-conduct "state action doctrine," see generally 2 <EM>Antitrust Law</EM> Developments 965-89.)  Compulsion is a basis for determining that a true conflict of laws existed between United States law and that of a foreign country.  <EM>Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California</EM>, 113 S.Ct. 2891, 2910-11 (1993).  This doctrine is generally interpreted narrowly.  It will not be applied where private conduct was simply sanctioned or assisted by a foreign government.
<P>
The foreign sovereign compulsion defense has been successfully invoked in at least one reported case.  <EM>Interamerican Refining Corp. v. Texaco Maracaibo, Inc.</EM>, 307 F.Supp. 1291 (D. Del. 1970) (defendant not liable under Sherman Act for an illegal group boycott where ordered by foreign government not to sell oil to a particular refiner).
<P>
<STRONG>D.  <EM>Noerr-Pennington</EM>
</STRONG><P>
The "<EM>Noerr-Pennington </EM>doctrine" refers to a body of principles under which legitimate efforts to solicit government action have received antitrust immunity, notwithstanding the fact that those efforts may handicap competitors, suppress rivalry, or otherwise restrict competition.  See generally 2 <EM>Antitrust Law Developments</EM> 989-1016 (discussing <EM>Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.</EM>, 365 U.S. 127 (1961); <EM>United Mine Workers v. Pennington</EM>, 381 U.S. 657 (1965); and related cases).  The Supreme Court has not ruled on whether the doctrine applies to petitioning of foreign governments, and lower courts are split on the issue. 
<P>
In particular, several courts have questioned the applicability of the doctrine outside the context of the United States political process.  See, e.g., <EM>Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Buttes Gas & Oil Co.,</EM> 331 F. Supp. 92, 108 (C.D. Cal. 1971), aff'd per curiam, 461 F.2d 1261 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 950 (1972);<EM> Laker Airways v. Pan Am. World Airways</EM>, 604 F. Supp. 280, 287 n.20 (D.D.C. 1984).  Other courts have exhibited a willingness to apply the doctrine in the international context.  See, e.g., <EM>Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. Hunt</EM>, 694 F.2d 1358, 1372 (5th Cir. 1983).
<P>
The enforcement agencies have stated that they will apply the <EM>Noerr-Pennington </EM>doctrine to conduct designed to influence foreign governments in the same manner that the doctrine is applied in the context of the United States government.  <EM>Federal Guidelines</EM>  3.34. 
<P>
<STRONG>E.  Statutory Exemptions
</STRONG><P>
<STRONG>1.  Webb-Pomerene Act
</STRONG><P>
Enacted in 1918, the Webb-Pomerene Act, 15 U.S.C.  61-65, provides antitrust immunity for trade associations engaged exclusively in the export "of goods, wares and merchandise."  This immunity does not extend to any conduct by trade associations that has an anticompetitive impact in the United States or that injures its domestic competitors.  In order to be eligible for this protection, trade associations must file articles of incorporation and annual reports with the FTC.
<P>
<STRONG>2.  Certificates of Review
</STRONG><P>
Under the Export Trading Company Act of 1982, persons may obtain export trade certificates of review from the Secretary of Commerce with the concurrence of the Attorney General.  15 U.S.C.  4011-21.  Persons named in the certificate obtain limited immunity from the application of state and federal antitrust laws for activities falling within and complying with the terms of the certificate.
<P>
In order to obtain a certificate, the applicant must show that the export conduct in question (a) will result in neither a substantial lessening of competition or restraint of trade within the United States nor a substantial restraint of the export trade of any competitor; (b) will not unreasonably enhance, stabilize or depress prices in the United States for the class of goods or services covered by the certificate; (c) will not constitute unfair methods of competition against competitors engaged in the export of the class of goods or services; and (d) will not include any act that may reasonably be expected to result in the sale for consumption or resale in the United States of such goods or services.  15 U.S.C.  4013(a).
<P>
Certificate holders are protected against criminal and treble damage liability under the antitrust laws for all conduct specified in the certificate, 15 U.S.C.  4016(b), but a plaintiff may still obtain actual damages or injunctive relief.  Certificate holders remain liable in both private and government enforcement actions for anticompetitive conduct falling outside the terms of the certificate.  
<P>
Certificates may be revoked at any time by the Secretary of Commerce or Attorney General if a determination is made that the certificate holder's activities cease to comply with any of the statutory criteria. Certificates procured by fraud are void ab initio.  15 U.S.C.  4013(f).
<P>
<STRONG>3.  Cooperative Research and Production
</STRONG><P>
The National Cooperative Research and Production Act, 15 U.S.C.  4301-06, establishes a voluntary reporting mechanism under which parties may notify the Attorney General and FTC about joint research and development and joint production ventures.  The Act requires courts to apply a rule of reason test to activities within the scope of the notification:  conduct "shall be judged on the basis of its reasonableness, taking into account all relevant factors affecting competition, including, but not limited to, effects on competition in properly defined, relevant research, development, product, process and service markets."  15 U.S.C.  4302.  Where private plaintiffs are able to establish that the conduct is unlawful under the reasonableness standard, the Act limits the antitrust relief to actual rather than treble damages, provided that a production joint ventures will benefit from the detrebling provision only if (a) its principal production facilities are located within the U.S. or its territories and (b) "each person who controls any party to such venture (including the party itself) is a United States person, or a foreign person from a country whose law accords antitrust treatment no less favorable to United States persons than to such country's domestic persons with respect to participation in joint ventures for production."  15 U.S.C.  4306(2).
<P>
<STRONG>4.  National Defense
</STRONG><P>
The Defense Production Act of 1950 establishes antitrust immunity for persons who participate at the request of the President in certain national defense programs relating to preparedness, production, and supply.  50 U.S.C. App.  2158.  The immunity also extends to certain voluntary agreements and plans of action for international allocation of petroleum products.  50 U.S.C. App.  2158a.
<P>
<H3>III.     Discovery, Remedies, and Relief in Foreign Commerce Cases
</H3><P>
Operations outside of the United States also complicate discovery and relief in antitrust cases.  We summarize related issues here.
<P>
<STRONG>A.  Procedures for Obtaining Foreign Documents
</STRONG><P>
If a court has proper jurisdiction over a party and that party has "possession, custody or control" of documents subject to a discovery request, the physical location of documents does not determine whether they must be produced.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 34.  The court, however, generally will weigh the national interests of the country in which the documents are located in determining whether to exercise its power to compel production. See <EM>Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States District Court</EM>, 482 U.S. 522, 546 (1987).  The factors to be weighed include the importance of the requested discovery, the degree of specificity of the request, the country of origin of the requested material, the availability of alternative means of obtaining the requested material, and the extent to which important interests of the countries involved would be undermined.  Id.
<P>
Courts may use letters rogatory as a means of to facilitate discovery.  Such letters are essentially a request to the courts of another country to use their powers and procedures as a matter of comity to assist discovery in the United States.  Letters rogatory may be transmitted directly by the United States court or sent via the U.S. Department of State.  28 U.S.C.  1781.  See also Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters, 28 U.S.T. 2555, T.I.A.S. No. 7444, reprinted in 28 U.S.C.  1781.
<P>
<STRONG>B. Foreign Blocking Statutes
</STRONG><P>
Because of concerns over United States intrusion into sovereign matters, several countries have enacted "blocking statutes" that limit the extent to which persons subject to their jurisdiction may comply with foreign discovery requests.  Prominent examples include Australia, Canada, France, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
<P>
<STRONG>C.  International Cooperative Enforcement 
</STRONG><P>
The International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act was signed into law in November 1994.  Pub. L. No. 103-438.  The IAEAA provides United States enforcement agencies with the authority to enter into mutual assistance agreements with foreign antitrust authorities pursuant to which, among other things, the governments may exchange evidence that would otherwise be protected from disclosure.
<P>
In 1991, prior to the passage of the IAEAA, the United States had entered into an antitrust cooperation agreement with the European Union.  A similar cooperation agreement with Canada became effective on August 3, 1995.  That agreement contains provisions for the exchange of information about enforcement activities and cooperation and coordination in the enforcement of antitrust laws.  See 69 Antitrust & Trade Reg. Rep. (BNA) 174 (Aug. 10, 1995).
<P>
<STRONG>D. Comity Considerations in Fashioning Relief
</STRONG><P>
United States courts have the authority to order affirmative relief abroad.  See <EM>United States v. Holophane Co</EM>., 1954 Trade Cas. (CCH)  67,679 (S.D. Ohio 1954), aff'd per curiam, 352 U.S. 903 (1956).  In ordering relief for anticompetitive conduct that has a foreign nexus, particularly injunctive relief,  courts will consider the difficulty of enforcing the antitrust decree abroad and will take international comity into account.  See, e.g., <EM>United States v. Watchmakers of Switzerland Information Center, Inc.</EM>,1963 Trade Cas. (CCH)  70,600 (S.D.N.Y. 1962), order modified, 1965 Trade Cas. (CCH)  71,352 (S.D.N.Y. 1965).
<P>
<STRONG>E. Sovereignty and Extraterritoriality Considerations in Fashioning Relief
</STRONG><P>
Extraterritorial application and enforcement of  antitrust laws has sometimes engendered concern and even resentment among foreign countries, many of which view such action as a violation of their national sovereignty. Many countries have reacted by enacting blocking statutes that, in addition to limiting discovery within their territorial jurisdictions, see supra Part III.B, serve to bar certain types of enforcement.  In the United Kingdom, for example, the Secretary of Trade may bar enforcement of foreign judgments that involve multiple damage awards.  To address and remedy such concerns, the United States and a number of other countries have entered into bilateral cooperation agreements that facilitate enforcement of both United States and foreign antitrust laws.<P>
