<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Cooling System</FONT></B>
<BR>
</CENTER>   
<FONT SIZE=3>  
<P>
The purpose of the engine's cooling system is to remove excess heat from the engine, to keep the engine operating at its most efficient temperature, and to get the engine up to the correct temperature as soon as possible after starting. Ideally, the cooling system keeps the engine running at its most efficient temperature no matter what the operating conditions are.  
<P>
As fuel is burned in the engine, about one-third of the energy in the fuel is converted into power. Another third goes out the exhaust pipe unused, and the remaining third becomes heat energy.  
<P>
A cooling system of some kind is necessary in any internal combustion engine. If no cooling system were provided, parts would melt from the heat of the burning fuel, and the pistons would expand so much they could not move in the cylinders (called "seize").   
<P>
The cooling system of a water-cooled engine consists of: the engine's water jacket, a thermostat, a water pump, a radiator and radiator cap, a cooling fan (electric or belt-driven), hoses, the heater core, and usually an expansion (overflow) tank.   
<P>
Fuel burning engines produce enormous amounts of heat; temperatures can reach up to 4,000 degrees F when the air-fuel mixture burns. However, normal operating temperature is about 2,000 degrees F. The cooling system removes about one-third of the heat produced in the combustion chamber.  
<P>
The exhaust system takes away much of the heat, but parts of the engine, such as the cylinder walls, pistons, and cylinder head, absorb large amounts of the heat. If a part of the engine gets too hot, the oil film fails to protect it. This lack of lubrication can ruin the engine.  
<P>
On the other hand, if an engine runs at too low a temperature, it is inefficient, the oil gets dirty (adding wear and subtracting horsepower), deposits form, and fuel mileage is poor-- not to mention exhaust emissions! For these reasons, the cooling system is designed to stay out of the action until the engine is warmed up.  
<P>
There are two types of cooling systems; liquid cooling and air cooling. Most auto engines are cooled by the liquid type; air cooling is used more frequently for airplanes, motorcycles and lawnmowers.  
<P>
Liquid cooled engines have passages for the liquid, or coolant, through the cylinder block and head. The coolant has to have indirect contact with such engine parts as the combustion chamber, the cylinder walls, and the valve seats and guides. Running through the passages in the engine heats the coolant (it absorbs the heat from the engine parts), and going through the radiator cools it.  After getting "cool" again in the radiator, the coolant comes back through the engine. This business continues as long as the engine is running, with the coolant absorbing and removing the engine's heat, and the radiator cooling the coolant.  
<P>
A cooling system pressure tester is used to check the pressure in the cooling system, which allows the mechanic to determine if the system has any slow leaks. The leak can then be found and fixed before it causes a major problem. 
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>The Heater Core  </FONT></B></CENTER>                

<P>
The heater core is a smaller version of the radiator that is used to keep your toes warm when it's cold outside.
<P>
The heater core is mounted under the dash board. Some of the hot coolant is routed through this little radiator, by more hoses. A small electric fan is also mounted there especially for the purpose of directing the heat inside the car. To turn this fan on, you use a switch called "fan" or "blower," located on your control panel.  The principle is exactly the same as the one used in the radiator for your engine, except that the heat is released inside the car instead of outside. Most engines use the heater core to warm the air coming from the air conditioner if the dash setting is not on "cold". More efficient designs don't do this because it makes the engine work harder than it has to. They cycle the compressor on and off to lessen the cooling output.  
<P>
If your car is running hot, turning the heater on will help to reduce the heat in the engine. Unfortunately, most cars don't overheat in the winter.

<FONT SIZE=4><B> The Thermostat</B></FONT>

</CENTER>

<P>
Just like your body needs to warm up when you begin to exercise, your car's engine needs to warm up when it starts its exercise.  
<P>
The thermostat provides control for your engine's warm-up period.  
<P>
The thermostat is located between the engine and the radiator. This little temperature-sensitive spring valve stays closed during engine warm-up. When the thermostat is closed, it prevents coolant from leaving the engine and circulating through the radiator until the correct running temperature is reached. The correct running temperature for most engines is between 180 degrees F and 200 degrees F. When the right temperature is reached, the spring valve opens, allowing coolant to circulate through the radiator to be cooled-- almost like our bodies begin to perspire after we've warmed-up.  
<P>
The temperature at which the thermostat is designed to open is called its rating, and may be stamped on the body. The 180 Degrees F thermostat begins to open at (you guessed it!) 180 Degrees F and is fully opened at 200 degrees F. Different engines use different temperature thermostats.  
<P>
Some high range thermostats maintain engine operating temperatures above 200 degrees F. This causes the engine to burn up more pollutants and aids in emissions control. However the range for your thermostat depends on the type of your engine, load requirements, weather, and other variables.  
<P>
Most thermostats are the "pellet" type; the name comes from the wax pellet that expands as the engine coolant warms. The pellet's expansion forces the valve open. Thermostats occasionally get "stuck shut" which cuts off the cooling capacity of the radiator, at least partially. This often occurs after an engine has overheated for some other reason, such as when the water pump fails, or if a large coolant leak develops. For this reason, car makers usually place the thermostat in an accessible position.
<P>
Depending on the air temperature, the engine should take from five to fifteen minutes to warm up. If your engine takes a long time to warm up, or if it always runs hot, you might need to test the thermostat. A malfunctioning thermostat can cause excessive engine wear and waste fuel. A good time to have your thermostat checked is just before summer or winter.  
<P>                          

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Radiator Hoses</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Hoses are used to connect the engine and the water pump to the radiator. Radiator hoses are made of flexible rubber; size varies depending upon the type of engine. Smaller hoses run to the heater core, these are known as (you guessed it) heater hoses.  
<P>
Three types of hoses are; the common hose, the molded or shaped hose, and the accordion type hose. All of these hoses may have spiral wire in their construction. Spiral wire can be molded or inserted into the hoses, in the required shape, when the hose is constructed.  
<P>
The common hose is straight and cannot take much bending before collapsing. It is made of rubber with fabric reinforcement.  
<P>
Molded or shaped hoses are the same as the common hose with one exception. They will not collapse when bent, because all of the bends that they need are already molded into them.  
<P>
Accordion type hoses not only put up with all kinds of severe bending, but they also absorb some of the vibration between the engine and the radiator.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Water (Coolant) Jackets</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
When our bodies feel cold, we put on a jacket. Our car engines wear permanent jackets for the opposite reason-- to keep cool!   
<P>
The water jacket is a collection of passages within the block and head. These passages let the coolant circulate around the "hot spots" (valve seats and guides, cylinder walls, combustion chamber, etc.) in order to cool them off.
<P>
The engine block is actually manufactured in one piece with the water jackets cast into the block and cylinder head. At normal operating temperature, the water pump forces the coolant through the head gasket openings and on into the water jackets in the cylinder head. It flows around in there, cooling everything off by absorbing the heat. After doing its thing, the coolant flows through the upper hose to the radiator where it releases the heat.  Then, the water pump sends it back down into the engine's water jackets to continue the cooling process.  
<P>
On the sides of the engine are "freeze" or "expansion" plugs, which are sheet metal plugs pressed into a series of holes in the block. These are designed to hold the pressure of the cooling system, but to pop out if the coolant in the block ever freezes.  
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Heater Core</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P> 
The heater core is a smaller version of the radiator that is used to keep your toes warm when it's cold outside.  
<P>
The heater core is mounted under the dash board. Some of the hot coolant is routed through this little radiator, by more hoses. A small electric fan is also mounted there especially for the purpose of directing the heat inside the car. To turn this fan on, you use a switch called "fan" or "blower," located on your control panel.  The principle is exactly the same as the one used in the radiator for your engine, except that the heat is released inside the car instead of outside. Most engines use the heater core to warm the air coming from the air conditioner if the dash setting is not on "cold". More efficient designs don't do this because it makes the engine work harder than it has to. They cycle the compressor on and off to lessen the cooling output.  
<P>
If your car is running hot, turning the heater on will help to reduce the heat in the engine. Unfortunately, most cars don't overheat in the winter.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Fan Clutch  </B></FONT></CENTER> 

<P> 
The fan clutch is a small fluid coupling with a thermostatic device that controls a variable-speed fan. The fan clutch ensures that the fan will rotate at just the right speed to keep the engine from overheating, and reduces drive to the fan when it is no longer needed.  
<P>
The fan clutch has a fluid coupling partly filled with silicone oil designed for just that purpose. If the temperature of the air passing through the radiator rises, the heat alerts a bimetal coil spring to "uncoil" or expand. When it expands, it allows just a little more oil to enter the fluid coupling, so the fluid coupling starts to rotate the fan. If the air coming through the radiator is cool, the opposite happens; the coil spring contracts, the oil leaves the fluid coupling and the fan slows. Slowing the fan when it is not needed reduces fuel consumption, makes less noise and saves engine power.  
<P>
Sometimes a flat bimetal strip spring is used instead of a coil spring; it bows out and in when the temperature rises and drops, letting oil in and out of the fluid coupling.   
<P> 

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Freeze Plugs (Expansion Plugs)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P> 
Freeze plugs (also called "blind" or "expansion core" plugs) are small steel plugs used to seal the holes in the engine block and head made in casting. They expand and flatten as they are driven into place, and make a tight seal. These are designed to hold the pressure of the cooling system, but to pop out if the coolant in the block ever freezes.  
<P>
If you have a leak in your cooling system, freeze plugs are one of the areas to have checked.  
<P>   

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Temperature Sending Units </B></FONT></CENTER>  

<P> 
Since it is critical for you to keep an eye on the temperature of the coolant in your cooling system at all times, your car will have either a gauge or a warning light located on the instrument panel or dashboard (see temperature gauge). The question is, how does the  information about your coolant get to the gauge? It gets there, or is sent by the temperature sending unit.  
<P>
The temperature sending unit is a device that is placed so that it can determine the temperature of the engine coolant. Simply put, its resistance to electricity changes with increases and decreases in the temperature of the coolant. The electric resistance changes control the movement of the indicator needle on the temperature gauge. If you have an indicator light, or lights, these changes will cause the bulb to be connected to the battery if the temperature of your coolant gets too high. If this happens, the light goes on.  
<P>
There are two types of sending units. One type uses a Bourdon tube instrument, a capillary tube filled with a special gas, and a capsule, or bulb. The other type uses an electric sender receiver.  
<P>
The Bourdon tube type works by having one end of the tube attached to the gauge fitting, and the free end fastened to the needle indicator. A Bourdon tube is a round, hollow metal tube. Putting pressure on the hollow end causes it to try to straighten, so that the other end moves the needle on the gauge. Because it is placed in an engine water jacket, the pressure from the coolant temperature causes it to move, which, in turn forces the other end to move the gauge needle. When the coolant cools, the lack of pressure allows the needle to swing back to cold on the gauge.  
<P>
The electric sender receiver type has a bimetal thermostat in the dashboard. This thermostat is linked to the gauge needle, so that when the engine gets warmer and passes more current, the thermostat, getting hotter itself, bends. When the thermostat bends, it moves the gauge needle, which indicates that the coolant temperature is rising. As it cools off, the thermostat "unbends" again, and the needle drops back to the cold indicator.

<BR>
</CENTER>                           

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
The radiator is a device designed to dissipate the heat which the coolant has absorbed from the engine. It is constructed to hold a large amount of water in tubes or passages which provide a large area in contact with the atmosphere. It usually consists of a radiator core, with its water-carrying tubes and large cooling area, which are connected to a receiving tank (end cap) at the top and to a dispensing tank at the bottom. Side flow radiators have their "endcaps" on the sides, which allows a lower hood line.  
<P>
In operation, water is pumped from the engine to the top (receiving) tank, where it spreads over the tops of the tubes. As the water passes down through the tubes, it loses its heat to the airstream which passes around the outside of the tubes. To help spread the heated water over the top of all the tubes, a baffle plate is often placed in the upper tank, directly under the inlet hose from the engine.   
<P>
Sooner or later, almost everyone has to deal with an overheating car. Since water is readily available, it is not beyond the ability of most people to add some to their radiator if it's low. <B>BUT PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN OR SERIOUS BURNS CAN RESULT. Here are a few pointers for dealing with an overheated radiator: </B> 
<UL>
	<LI>Turn off the A/C. If the car is not seriously overheating, this will reduce the engine's temperature. The AC evaporator is located in front of the radiator, and it adds heat to the air going to your engine. The hotter the incoming air is, the less efficient the radiator will be.  
	<LI>Turn on your heater (set on highest temperature setting, with blower on highest setting). This will be uncomfortable for you, but it will cool the engine by transferring the heat to the air. Roll down the windows, and remember how 'hot' you'll get if your engine needs replacement!  
	<LI>If you're stuck in traffic, pull over and stop. Unless you're moving, very little cool air reaches the radiator. Open the hood and let the engine cool off. This takes time, so be patient. Use the time to go get a jug of water or antifreeze.  
	<LI>Check the overflow tank coolant level. If it's empty, the radiator is probably low on coolant.  
	<LI>Check the pressure of the system by wrapping a cloth around the upper radiator hose and squeezing it. If it's still under pressure (hot) it will not squeeze easily. Wait until it does.  
	<LI>Place a large cloth over the radiator cap, and CAREFULLY release the pressure.<B>DANGER: SERIOUS BURNS CAN RESULT FROM THE HOT COOLANT. IF IN DOUBT, WAIT UNTIL THE ENGINE COOLS COMPLETELY.  </B> 
	<LI>If the coolant is low, start the engine, and slowly add the water or coolant necessary to fill it up. <B>THE ENGINE MUST BE RUNNING. ADDING COOLANT TO A WARM ENGINE CAN CRACK THE BLOCK.</B>  By running the engine, the coolant keeps moving and reduces the chances of this type of damage occurring.  
</UL> 
<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Water Pump</FONT></B></CENTER>                                                  

<P>
Water pumps come in many designs, but most include a rotating impeller, which forces the coolant through the engine block.  In most rear wheel drive cars, the fan is installed on the end of the water pump shaft. Many water pumps have a spring-loaded seal to avoid leakage of water around the pump shaft. Modern pumps are fitted with pre-packed ball bearings, which are sealed at each end to eliminate the need for lubrication.   
<P>
Impeller type water pumps must turn rapidly to be efficient, and worn or loose drive belts can permit slippage which is not easily detected.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Expansion (Overflow) Tank</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Several cooling systems make use of a clear plastic container, which is connected to the overflow tube from the radiator. This container provides extra storage space for the coolant when it expands and is called the expansion, or overflow tank. It is also known as the coolant reservoir, or overflow canister.  
<P>
As the engine heats up, the coolant inside it expands. Without the expansion tank, the coolant would flow out of the overflow tube and be lost from the cooling system onto the street. Instead, the coolant flows into the expansion tank.  
<P>
Since a vacuum is created in the cooling system when the engine cools, the vacuum causes some of the coolant in the expansion tube to be sucked back into the system. Because a cooling system with an expansion tank is virtually a closed system, the coolant can flow between the system and the expansion tank as it expands and contracts. This way, no coolant is lost if the system is functioning properly.  
<P>
Another function of the expansion tank is to remove air bubbles from the cooling system. Coolant without air-bubbles is much more efficient than coolant with air bubbles, because it absorbs heat much faster.  
<P>
The advantage of the expansion tank is that while the level of coolant contained in it rises and falls, the radiator is always full.  
<P>
Older cars can easily be fitted with expansion tanks, simply by mounting the tank near the radiator, connecting it to the overflow tube, and replacing the radiator cap.
<P>
  
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>  Radiator Cap (Pressure Cap)</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The radiator cap acts as more than just a "lid" for your radiator; it keeps your engine cool by sealing and pressurizing the coolant inside it.  
<P>
What makes the radiator cap special is that it is designed to hold the coolant in your radiator under a predetermined amount of pressure. If the coolant was not kept under pressure, it would start to boil, and soon you would have boiled all of your coolant away.  
<P>
However, the radiator (or pressure) cap prevents this from happening by exerting enough pressure to keep the coolant from boiling. Normally, water (coolant) boils at 212 degrees F, but if the pressure is increased, the boiling temperature is also increased. Since the boiling point goes up when the pressure goes up, the coolant can be safely heated to a temperature above 212 degrees F without boiling.   
<P>
What makes this important is that the higher the temperature of the coolant is, the greater the temperature gap between it and the air temperature is. This is the principle that causes the cooling system to work; the hotter the coolant is, the faster the heat in it moves to the radiator and the air passing by. So, a cooling system under pressure takes heat away from the engine faster, which makes it more efficient.  
<P>
If your cooling system is under too much pressure, it can "blow its top!" To prevent this, the radiator cap has a pressure relief valve. The valve has a preset rating that allows it to take just up to a certain amount of pressure. When you turn the cap on the filler neck of the radiator, you seal the upper and lower sealing surfaces of the filler neck. The pressure relief valve spring is compressed against the lower seal when you lock the cap.  
<P>
The radiator filler neck has an overflow tube right between the two sealing surfaces. If the pressure in the cooling system exceeds the preset rating of your cap, its pressure relief valve allows the lower seal to be lifted from its seat. Then the excess pressure (coolant,air) can squish through the overflow tube to the ground or the coolant reservoir.  
<P>
Once enough pressure has been released (the caps preset rating), the pressure relief valve is again closed by the spring.  
<P>
The pressure cap can be tested with a cooling system pressure tester, using an adapter, to make certain that it is living up to its pressure rating. It should be replaced if it fails the test.  
<P>
Note: Most radiator pressure caps are not meant to be removed. Coolant should always be added through the expansion (overflow) tank. NEVER REMOVE THE RADIATOR CAP FROM A HOT ENGINE. REMOVING THE PRESSURE CAN CAUSE STEAM TO SHOOT OUT AND SERIOUSLY BURN YOU.
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Cooling Fans</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The reason the coolant goes into the radiator is to allow air to pass through it and cool the coolant. When you are driving fast enough, the air rushes through the grille of the car and passes through the radiator core. If you aren't driving fast enough to push air through the radiator, then the fan will pull the air through.  
<P>
The fan improves cooling when you are driving at slow speeds, or if the engine is idling. It is usually mounted on the water pump shaft, and is turned by the same belt that drives the water pump and the alternator, although it can be mounted as an independent unit. Most independently mounted fans are electric.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B> Belt Powered Fans</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The fan's activity is not always necessary, and it takes power from the engine to spin. For this reason a thermostatic control, or fan clutch, is often used to reduce drive torque when it isn't needed (variable-speed fan). A different type of fan uses centrifugal force to move its flexible plastic blades, by flattening them when the engine rpm is high (flexible-blade fan). The less angle the blade shave, the less power they use. The idea of these units is to save horsepower and reduce the noise the fan makes.  
<P>
A fan can have from four to six blades to suck the air through the radiator. Often the radiator has a shroud for the fan to keep it from recirculating the same hot air that has collected behind the radiator. Many fans have irregularly spaced blades to reduce resonant noise. 
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>Electric Fans   </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
Front-wheel drive engines mounted transversely usually use electric fans to cool the engine. The radiator is located in the usual place, but an electric motor drives the fan. A thermostatic switch is used to turn the fan on and off at predetermined temperature settings, which it senses. The exception to this is air conditioning. If you turn on the air conditioner, you bypass the thermostatic switch, and the fan runs continuously. If you turn off the air conditioner, the thermostatic switch is re-activated, and goes back to turning the fan on and off, according to its instructions. Many cars have one electric fan for normal cooling and a separate one just for when the air conditioner is on.  
<P>
There are some really nice features about the electric fan. The nicest feature is that you don't have to keep an eye on the treacherous old fan belt -- there isn't one, so you don't have to worry about its health and fitness. It's also quieter, and less of a power drain on the engine. They also help your engine by continuing to cool it after it's turned off.  
<P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4><B>V-Belt (Fan Belt)  </B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>
The fan (drive) belt wedges neatly into the different pulley grooves. The belt uses the tension and friction to turn the auxiliary devices.  
<P>
The fan belt is usually V-shaped, so it is also called a V-belt.  The fan belt friction comes from the sides of the belt and the sides of the pulley grooves to transmit power from one pulley to the other through the belt. Since the sides of the belt are used for transmission of power, the sides have very large surface areas.  The reason that the belt does not slip is because of the wedging action of the belt as it curves into the pulley grooves.  
<P>
Because your belts are so essential to so many parts of your engine, it is a very good idea to periodically check their condition. Check for cracking, splitting, or fraying, especially before summer.  Also, check the tightness of the belt and have it adjusted according to your owner's manual specifications.  Belts have a tendency to loosen with use. On the other hand, you don't want the belt to be too tight, or it will put too much pressure on the accessory bearings and cause them to die an early death. If a belt is over three years old, have it replaced even if it looks good.

<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 ALT="ISD Welcome Header" SRC="/graphics/logos/isd_welcome.gif"></CENTER><P>
Welcome to the Intelligent Systems Division (ISD).  We are an integral part
of the <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/mel/melhome.html">Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory</A> at the <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of
Standards and Technology</A>.<P>

An intelligent system is &quot;a system with the ability to act appropriately in
an uncertain environment.&quot;  ISD  works with industry , universities, and
other government agencies in the development of new measurement techniques
and standards for intelligent machine systems, robots, and automated
manufacturing systems.  ISD's focus is to provide a theoretical framework
for the development of interface standards and performance measures for
intelligent systems, and to develop engineering guidelines for the design
and implementation of intelligent control systems for a wide variety of
applications.<P>

<A HREF="/brochure/EMC.html"><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="/graphics/brochure/EMCsm.gif"></A>

    One example of our work is the <A HREF="/brochure/EMC.html"> Enhanced Machine Controller(EMC)</A> which
is an engineering testbed for open architecture interface standards for
intelligent machine controllers.   The EMC consortium is a group of
control system developers, vendors, and users that are working to develop a
set of Application Programming Interface standards for intelligent
controllers.  Other examples include the <A HREF="/brochure/NGIS.html"> Next Generation Inspection System</A>,
the <A HREF="/brochure/Hexapod.html"> Hexapod</A>  machine tool, and the<A HREF="/brochure/RoboCrane.html"> RoboCrane&#174;</A>.  These are being used to
develop and test measurement and control techniques for a new family of
intelligent machines, and to study interface standards for distributed and
virtual manufacturing systems.<P> 


<A HREF="/brochure/Hexapod.html"><IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/Hexapod3sm.gif"></A>

    ISD also works with other government agencies and private industry in
developing new applications for intelligent systems with high national
priority, such as in manufacturing, construction, environmental clean-up,
transportation systems, and military applications.<P>

<A HREF="/brochure/RoboCrane.html"><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="/graphics/brochure/robocrane2sm.gif"></A>


ISD strives to enhance U.S. industrial competitiveness through development
and application of intelligent system technologies and standards.  If there
are areas where you feel ISD's  experience in intelligent systems might be
useful to your business, please sign our guest book and contact a project
leader or myself about your interests.  There are many ways, including a
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, by which we can work with
you on a project of mutual interest.<P>

<H3> Research interest summary </H3>

<P> Dr. Coombs's chief interest is in the <B>role of vision in
achieving robust behavior</B> by autonomous systems.  He is currently
developing <B>foveal-peripheral active vision</B> for real-time robot
mobility and surveillance.  For the past several years he has been
developing real-time active vision and gaze control of camera
movements to aid visual perception.  This has <B>enabled a moving
robot to keep its cameras smoothly following a nearby moving
object</B>.  The approach exploits the control of camera movements to
simplify the visual processing that is required.  The same broad
principle has been applied to a robot that uses <B>low-resolution
peripheral motion perception to steer between obstacles</B> in a
laboratory.  The mobile robot rotationally stabilizes its wide-angle
camera as it turns.  The camera motion approximates forward
translation, which simplifies visual interpretation.  While potential
hazards can be detected with low-resolution vision, some hazards
require high-resolution foveal vision to determine their nature and
the action that must be taken; combined foveal and peripheral vision
is currently being investigated.</P>

<P> Dr. Coombs's research interests range over <B>computer and
biological vision, multimedia communications, real-time systems,
robotics, and human-computer interaction</B>.  Computer vision
interests include active vision, image understanding, and machine
vision.  Interests in biological vision include computational models,
human visual perception, and human factors.  Robotics interests center
on achieving robust behavior through task-oriented perception,
adaptive sensorimotor behavior, and learning in planning and control.
Coombs has also developed a prototype foveal-peripheral stereo-visual
telepresence system for teleoperation involving maneuvering and
hand-eye coordination of a robot crane.</P>

<b>ABSTRACT</b><p>
<b></b>The <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov">National Institute of Standards and Technology</A> (NIST) has developed
a modular definition of components for machine control, and a specification to
their interfaces, with broad application to robots, machine tools, and
coordinate measuring machines. These components include individual axis
control, coordinated trajectory generation, discrete input/output, language
interpretation, and task planning and execution. The intent of the
specification is to support interoperability of components provided by
independent vendors. NIST has installed a machine tool controller based on
these interfaces on a 4-axis horizontal machining center at the Pontiac
Powertrain Division of General Motors (GM). The intent of this system is to
validate that the interfaces are comprehensive enough to serve a demanding
application, and to demonstrate several key concepts of open architecture
controllers: component interoperability, controller scalability, and function
extension. In particular, the GM-NIST Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC)
demonstrates interoperability of motion control hardware, scalability across
computing platforms, and extensibility via user-defined graphical user
interfaces. An important benefit of platform scalability is the ease with which
the developers could test the controller in simulation before site
installation. The EMC specifications are serving a larger goal of driving the
development of true industry standards that will ultimately benefit users of
machine tools, robots, and coordinate measuring machines. To this end, a
consortium has been established and cooperative participation with the
Department of Energy Technologies Enabling Agile Manufacturing (TEAM) program
and the United States Air Force Title III program has been undertaken. <p>
<b>1. INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<b></b>In the early 1990s, the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began the Enhanced
Machine Controller (EMC) program to develop a modular definition of components
for machine control [<A HREF="#REF1">1</A>]. The intent was to document the interfaces to
these modules to the degree that would allow independent third parties to
provide interoperable products. The development of this modular architecture
grew out of NIST's involvement with the United States Air Force's Next
Generation Controller (NGC) program, and the <A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/rcslib">Real-time Control System</A> (RCS)
architecture [<A HREF="#REF2">2</A>, <A HREF="#REF3">3</A>] which has evolved within NIST over many years. In a
unification of RCS with the NGC architecture as embodied in the Specification
for Open System Architecture Standards (SOSAS) [<A HREF="#REF4">4</A>], a definition of the
modules which make up a controller and their interfaces was developed. This
architecture is shown in <A HREF="#FIG1">Figure 1</A>. <p>
<A NAME="FIG1"></A>
<center><IMG SRC="/documents/proctor/sim/Fig1.gif"></center><p>
<ul>Figure 1. The Enhanced Machine Controller Architecture. The labels on the left, CELL through SERVO, indicate nomenclature from the NIST RCS reference model. WPSA, WMSA, CSA, and DIA represent modules from the NGC SOSAS. The EMC architecture is derived from an RCS analysis of machine controllers, and is consistent with the SOSAS model of standard applications.</ul><p>
In this figure, boxes indicate the individual modules for which interfaces have
been defined: workstation planning, workstation management, plan
interpretation, trajectory generation, servo control, and discrete
input/output. These have been mapped onto the broader NGC SOSAS "Standard
Applications" (SAs), e.g., Workstation Planning (WPSA), Workstation Management
(WMSA), and Controls (CSA). The EMC architecture defines modules at a higher
granularity within the CSA. This reflects both the existence of products at
this granularity, as well as their presence in the NIST reference model
architecture. The modules on the side indicated by DIA are Domain Independent
Applications, in SOSAS parlance. These modules do not require any specific
interfaces themselves, but may be developed using only the interfaces provided
by the other modules. For example, a necessary module for a controller is the
operator interface. However, implementations of the operator interface need
only avail themselves of messages to the controller and data provided by the
controller: no additional interfaces are required to be defined in order to
incorporate an operator interface into an EMC controller.<p>
The interface specifications are formalized in the C++ programming language,
using header files. The specification consists of messages into each module,
and world model data provided by each module. Both the messages and world model
data are implemented using C++ classes. Underlying the EMC architecture is a
model of data transfer, the Neutral Manufacturing Language [<A HREF="#REF5">5</A>] (NML).
This model provides for "mailboxes" of data, with one or more readers and
writers. The control methodology indicates that control commands into each
module originate with a single writer, and are read by a single reader. World
model data originates with a single writer, but may be read by arbitrarily many
readers. For example, both the trajectory generator module and the operator
interface may read the current position of the actuators as maintained by the
servo control module.<p>
The EMC specifications have been implemented on a variety of machines, both at
NIST and elsewhere. In this paper, we will describe an implementation built for
the General Motors (GM) Powertrain facility in Pontiac, Michigan, retrofitted
to a Kearney and Trecker (K&amp;T) 800-series horizontal machining center. The
intent of this installation was to provide a validation testbed for the
interfaces. In our laboratory implementations of the EMC, we often found
ourselves deferring the solution to problems that were not germane to the
research goals. In the case of the definition of EMC interfaces, however, we
found that our laboratory systems only took us so far, and we needed a true
production application to gain confidence that the interfaces would be
sufficient and correct.<p>
Due to the geographic separation between NIST in Maryland and GM in Michigan,
we found it necessary to build a high-fidelity simulation of the K&amp;T
machining center so that we could develop most of the controller locally.
Additionally, the requirement that the machine be available for use on a weekly
basis by the GM machinists meant that we needed our own development simulation
during the machine's use. Installation of a series of connectors allowed us to
quickly swap between the existing controller and the EMC, so that the
development cycle consisted of local coding and testing on the simulator,
controller swapover and test, and swapback. This provided both the development
team and the machinists reasonable access to the machine during the entire
development phase of the GM EMC.<p>
It is important to note that no portion of the controller was simulated: only
the machine to which the controller was installed. Simulating any portion of
the controller would introduce uncertainties when that portion was run on the
production machinery. Commercially available software applications for
simulating the machining process or motion control are widely available, but
were of little use during controller development since these products assume
ideal controller behavior and are used to validate the controller input. The
exact opposite situation applied to the EMC controller development: we assume
that the controller inputs (i.e., numerical control programs) are correct, and
the controller itself needs to be proven.<p>
<b>2. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION</b><p>
Before detailing the simulation of the EMC, it is worthwhile to describe the
actual machining center itself, particularly the physical interfaces to which
the EMC installs. The Kearney and Trecker 800 horizontal machining center has 4
axes of coordinated positioning. These axes are typically labeled X, Y, Z, and
B. The X axis is horizontal, and moves side to side when looking at the front
of the machine into the spindle tooling. The Y axis is vertical, and moves up
and down. The Z axis moves in and out, parallel to the axis of spindle
rotation. The B axis is a rotary axis, whose axis of rotation is parallel to
the up-and-down Y axis. Physically, it sits atop the X axis, and is level with
the floor similar to an audio turntable. The X and B axis form one kinematic
chain, and the Z and Y axes form a second. That is, the workpieces are affixed
to the B axis, which moves with the X; the spindle is affixed to the Y axis,
which moves with the Z.<p>
The spindle is position- or velocity controlled, providing up to 3000
revolutions per minute (rpms) of speed through 3 gear ranges. During cutting,
velocity is maintained using tachometer feedback. During positioning, for
example to orient the spindle during a tool change, resolver feedback is used
to precisely orient the spindle axis. In total, there are 5 axes of servo
control: 3 linear axes, 1 rotary, and the spindle.<p>
The K&amp;T 800 also has a tool change mechanism for 68 tools and a pallet
shuttle which allows pallets of workpieces to be loaded on or off the machine.
These are controlled by sequencing outputs to solenoids and hydraulic valves in
response to sensed limit switch closures. Altogether, there are 38 discrete
outputs and 66 discrete inputs.<p>
In order to maintain the uptime of the machine, we required a quick changeover
procedure that would allow us to convert to our development controller upon our
arrival, and to switch back to the original controller when we left. The staff
of General Motors provided engineers who designed the interfaces necessary for
this quick change procedure. Briefly, the procedure consisted of removing the
original resolver feedback from the X, Y, Z, and spindle axes and connecting
them to the resolver-to-encoder converter inputs of the EMC; removing the
amplifier outputs to the X, Y, Z, and spindle axes and connecting them to the
EMC outputs; and removing the computer logic ribbon cables for the discrete
input/output points and connecting them to the EMC digital input/output boards.
The B axis was left alone during the changeover, due to the incompatibility of
its electronics. Instead, we accessed its position feedback and velocity output
on the same digital interface that contained the discrete input/output
information. This necessitated a software servo, as described in a subsequent
section.<p>
In order to adequately test the controller locally, all of these components
required simulation. Whenever possible, the simulation was performed with
hardware as similar to the real hardware as possible. Ideally, we would have
liked to have an entire identical machine installed in our laboratory. In
practice, this was too expensive and would have taken far too much installation
time. In other cases, we simulated portions of the machine in software, taking
great care to characterize the system's timing during initial visits to the
production facility. Of course, much of the initial controller development
followed the time-honored practice of converting physical output signals to
printed output. While suitable for initial tests, this practice was almost
useless during most of the development since many of the problems encountered
in real-time systems originate with timing.<p>
The EMC simulation system consists of 4 components: a small 3-axis milling
machine which physically simulates the machining center and the signal inputs
and outputs to the axes; a duplication of the operator interface, including
pushbuttons and lights; a personal computer simulation of the discrete
input/output points of the controller which provides an identical interface to
the input/output points on the real machining center; and a graphical animation
of the machine. These components, shown in <A HREF="#FIG2">Figure 2</A>, are detailed in the following sections.<p>
<A NAME="FIG2"></A>
<center><IMG SRC="/documents/proctor/sim/Fig2.gif"></center><p>
<ul>Figure 2. Simulation setup of the EMC, with cabling omitted for simplicity. The output of the control computer is split between the desktop mill/spindle motor and the multiplexed interface to the software simulation of the discrete input/output. Parts can be machined on the desktop mill and verified visually. Tool changing and pallet shuttling are verified via the animation, which displays the state of the software I/O simulation in real time.</ul><p>
<b>3. AXIS SIMULATION</b><p>
<b></b>The machine's linear axes were simulated with a desktop milling machine
originally intended for prototype or model making. As sold, the unit provided
stepper motor control which had to be replaced with servo motors and amplifiers
to more closely duplicate the K&amp;T. Further complicating the control was the
fact that the original axis feedback devices on the K&amp;T were resolvers.
Because the desktop milling machine provided encoder feedback, and the motion
control boards we selected for the EMC required encoder feedback, we decided to
install resolver-to-encoder converters on the K&amp;T itself. Once this was
done, our interface to the axis servo control of the desktop machine was
identical to that of the production machine.<p>
However, some important differences remained. The minimill was a vertical
machining center while the K&amp;T was horizontal; the kinematic configuration
of the Y axes differed; we had no B axis on the simulated mill; and the homing
and overtravel limit switches on the K&amp;T were not available to the EMC
motion control boards. The horizontal- and vertical differences were of no
consequence for the control. More importantly, on the desktop mill, the X and Y
axes lay on the same kinematic chain which contained the workpiece fixture,
while the Z axis supported the spindle. On the K&amp;T, the Y axis was on the
spindle's kinematic chain along with the Z. Simulating the same kinematic
configuration would have meant significant rework on the desktop mill's support
structure, or purchasing a different mill altogether. In this case, we decided
that the uncertainty introduced by this difference would have little impact,
since the kinematic parameters were localized in the controller software and
were easily modifiable. In fact, the difference in this case allowed us to
verify that our attempt to localize kinematic parameters such as these actually
worked.<p>
We elected not to simulate the B axis since we estimated that the time it would
take to measure the dynamics of the B axis and simulate it would exceed the
time we would need to tune the control parameters on-site. The situation with
the homing and limit switches was entirely different. In this case, not having
this feedback on the K&amp;T meant that we would suffer significant lag time
between when these switches tripped and when our separate I/O controller could
report the trippings to the motion control boards. Therefore, we decided to
modify the wiring on the K&amp;T so that these inputs were available directly
to the EMC motion control system. Of course, this rewiring was done so as not
to impact the original controller. This solution simplified our simulation,
since now both the desktop mill and the production machine had identical
interfaces to the X, Y, and Z axes.<p>
<b>4. SPINDLE SIMULATION</b><p>
<b></b>Like the B axis, the spindle in our desktop mill differed from that on
the production machine. First, the spindle on the production machine had
tachometer feedback, which our desktop machine lacked. Second, the spindle
operated in 3 gear ranges, which we lacked on the desktop machine. Both of
these disparities were rectified on the testbed at NIST.<p>
To solve the spindle tachometer problem, we disconnected the controller's
spindle interface from the desktop mill, and installed it onto a separate motor
test stand consisting of a motor, amplifier, encoder, and tachometer. This
provided the identical interface to the real spindle. However, this rendered
the actual cutting head on the desktop mill uncontrolled. During cutting tests,
the spindle test stand had to be viewed as the cutting spindle, which proved
difficult. We also were required to turn the cutting spindle on and off from a
separate manual source. In defense of this setup, the system proved quite
adequate when developing the interface to controlling spindle speed and
orientation. Criticizing this setup, it proved difficult to verify that tapping
operations (which require synchronized Z axis motion and spindle rotation) were
correct. Like the tuning of the B axis parameters, we left development of this
feature of the controller to the on-site integration.<p>
Simulating the interaction of the spindle control with gear changing followed
naturally from our high-fidelity simulation of the discrete I/O system, which
is detailed in the following section. Anticipating this simulation, we were
provided simulated sensed values for the gear engagement, whose timing was
precisely measured and simulated. Verifying that spindle gearing changes
occurred properly was simply a matter of individually verifying that the
controller could access the state of the gear engagement, and visually
ascertaining that the required spindle speed sequences occurred at the proper
time during the gear shifting.<p>
<b>5. DISCRETE INPUT/OUTPUT SIMULATION</b><p>
<b></b>Due to the number of discrete inputs and outputs, and the difficulty in
replicating the custom mechanical structures for the tool changer and pallet
shuttle, a full software simulation of the discrete input/output system was
undertaken. The intent was to provide to the controller developers the
identical hardware interface that was present at the machine site. Recalling
the controller changeover procedure, this interface was a set of ribbon cables
on which were provided all the discrete input/output points that would be
connected to a commercial PC-bus card in the EMC. In order to remove any
uncertainty about this interface, a full hardware interface including the
multiplexing hardware was built. On the simulation side of this hardware
interface was a standalone PC running a full software simulation of the
discrete I/O system, containing the time delays and dependencies between the
limit switches and valves as characterized by timing studies performed early in
the installation. This system is depicted in <A HREF="#FIG3">Figure 3</A>. <p>
<A NAME="FIG3"></A>
<center><IMG SRC="/documents/proctor/sim/Fig3.gif"></center><p>
<ul>Figure 3. Discrete I/O Hardware Simulator. System consists of a duplication of the multiplexing interface to the actual machine tool, a software simulation of the timing for the discrete actuators and sensors, the simulated world model of the discrete I/O (e.g., tool changer, spindle gearing, pallet shuttle) and a serial connection to the real-time animation running on a graphics workstation.</ul>
<p>
This system provided immense aid in developing the programs for control of the
tool changer and pallet shuttle mechanisms. This was particularly evident when
comparing the development cycle with that in previous projects. For example,
assuming the programmers had access to a complete machine tool, programming
errors may have caused mechanism crashes and physical damage. On the simulator,
their effects were innocuous. Furthermore, in cases of complex mechanism
interaction, it is easy to put the mechanisms into a state requiring a tedious
step-by-step reversal of the failed sequence. Restarting the test after a
failure meant at most a simulator reboot.<p>
Of course, software simulation of the entire I/O system reduced the confidence
that the controller will perform on the real machine as it does on the
simulation. In this case, however, the laborious and costly task of duplicating
the physical tool changer and pallet shuttle (perhaps only possible by
purchasing a full machine tool) indicated the use of such a simulation.<p>
<b>6. OPERATOR INTERFACE</b><p>
<b></b>The interface used by the machinists to run the machining center
consisted of a PC-compatible monitor with touch screen, an industrial keyboard
and mouse, and a set of lighted pushbuttons and rotary switches. With the
exception of the pushbuttons and switches, all these components were easily
duplicated with off-the-shelf components for the local simulator. A touch
screen was omitted, since the mouse provided redundant capabilities.<p>
The panel containing the pushbuttons and switches required the fabrication of a
driver chassis, which converted the 24 Volt signals to 5 Volt signals
compatible with computer boards. This driver chassis remained at the local
development site until final installation, allowing the programmers to develop
the code to read the switches and light the lights locally. When the controller
was ready for installation, the driver chassis and associated front panel were
shipped to the installation site. This meant that for any further local debug
or development, the programmers were without a way to operate the controller.<p>
This unacceptable situation led to the immediate development of a graphical
surrogate to the control panel, which was accessible via one of the screens on
the graphics display. This simulated control panel provided all the inputs and
outputs of the hardware control panel, while saving the cost and time which
would have resulted had a new driver chassis and front panel been built.
However, the simulated control panel provided no support for the development of
the code which interfaced to the hardware driver chassis. For example, we could
not test the addition of a new hardware switch or modifications in the lighting
patterns. Fortunately, there have been no changes to the control panel design,
and this shortcoming of the simulation system has not been an impediment.<p>
One positive side effect of the development of the graphical control panel was
recently discovered: one of the transformers in the driver chassis failed, and
the machinist continued operation of the machine using the redundant graphical
version while technicians repaired the driver chassis. <p>
<b>7. ANIMATION</b><p>
<b></b>Supplementing the discrete I/O simulation is the graphical animation.
Unlike the desktop milling machine and motor test stand for the spindle, the
software simulator has no visibly verifiable output. What is desired is an
instantaneous snapshot of the state of the I/O system, particularly in cases
where the actuator and sensor states can be correlated with the obvious
position of mechanical components. Using a library of graphics primitives
developed during previous projects, an animation of the K&amp;T machine tool
was quickly built. The positions of the tool carousel, tool changer components,
and pallet shuttle were continuously updated based on the model of the world
maintained in the standalone PC simulation. This provided almost instantaneous
visual verification of the control sequencing. Coupled with the hardware
simulation of the machine's axes and spindle using the desktop milling machine
and spindle test stand, the full simulation system provided an invaluable
visual confirmation of the controller code under development.<p>
<b>8. SUMMARY</b><p>
<b></b>Based on the experience of developing a complex controller for a machine
located at a remote facility, in almost continuous use, the aid of a
high-fidelity simulation has proven invaluable. In particular, care was taken
to simulate only the machine being controlled, so that the controller under
development was almost plug-compatible with both the simulation system and the
real machine. With this as the case, the developers maintained a high degree of
confidence that the programs written to control the machine and verified on the
simulator would run correctly during the scarce time available for testing.
Some points evidenced during this development:<p>
* Full hardware simulation (e.g., machine duplication) gives the most
confidence but introduces the possibility of machine damage resulting from
failed tests;<p>
* Full software simulation speeds the development cycle, but reduces confidence
that the controller will perform on the real machine as it does on the
simulation;<p>
* Simulation of electronic interfaces (e.g., resolver-to-encoder converters or
multiplexers) introduces almost no risk of physical damage, while greatly
increasing the likelihood that the controller will operate on the real machine
as it does on the simulated version;<p>
* Use of easily obtainable hardware simulators (e.g., desktop milling machines
or motor test stands) is advantageous. Building physical simulations of custom
hardware (e.g., tool changer) may provide additional confidence, but will
increase the risk of damage and add to the cost and development time.

<b>ABSTRACT</b><p>
Open architecture controllers offer a multitude of benefits to users of machine
tools, robots, and coordinate measuring machines, ultimately reducing the
life-cycle costs of installing, operating, and maintaining manufacturing
equipment. Aside from those benefits resulting from basing a controller on
common operating systems and computing platforms, the main feature of an open
architecture is the public availability of interfaces to controller
functionality. These interfaces allow third parties who are not associated with
the original equipment manufacturers to provide enhancements to the
functionality of the machine. Efforts to standardize the interfaces to open
architecture machine tool controllers are underway both in the United States.
and abroad. In the United States, the Department of Energy and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology have cooperatively undertaken this
standards effort. One of the most important aspects of this program is the
validation of interfaces on actual machinery in production applications. The
goal of this validation process is to ensure that the interface specification
is broad enough to encompass a significant portion of manufacturing
applications, while still being practical to implement. This paper explores the
problems resulting from defining interfaces to general controller
functionality, when faced with the realities of validating the interfaces on
controllers with specific operating systems, computing platforms, and control
components.<p>
<b>KEYWORDS</b>: open architecture controllers, motion control, standards<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>
In the early 1990s, the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory of the <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) began the <A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/proj/emc">Enhanced Machine Controller</A> (EMC) program to develop a modular definition of components for
machine control [<A HREF="#Ref1">1</A>]. The intent was to document the interfaces to these modules
to the degree that would allow independent third parties to provide
interoperable products. The development of this modular architecture grew out
of NIST's experience developing controllers based on the Real-time Control
System (RCS) architecture which has evolved within NIST over many
years [<A HREF="#Ref2">2</A>]. NIST and the Department of Energy national laboratories have
combined their efforts in this area under the auspices of the <A HREF="http://cewww.eng.ornl.gov/team/home.html">Technologies
Enabling Agile Manufacturing</A> (TEAM) program, and are undertaking a formal
review of the interface specification that has resulted from recent
implementations of interface-based controllers [<A HREF="#Ref3">3</A>]. This review also includes
researchers from General Motors and the University of Michigan. A broader
review is anticipated within the <A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/proj/emc/consort.html">EMC Consortium</A>, established by NIST in January
1996 to formalize a three-year review of controller implementations based on
these interfaces.<p>
The intent of the review process is to include validation tests of the
interfaces to open architecture controllers in real-world applications. The
review process will address the question, "Does the interface specification
provide the necessary information required to support the features of open
architecture controllers?" The question is somewhat ill-defined due to the lack
of a precise definition of "open architecture." However, there are certain
commonly-understood features that open architecture controllers are expected to
have. Some of the most important features which drove the selection of the
validation tests were:<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Interoperability</b>: the ability of two or more components to exchange
information and use the information that has been exchanged.<p>
<li>
<b>Portability</b>: the ease with which a module can be made to run in a
controller based on another platform.<p>
<li>
<b>Extensibility</b>: the ability of users and third parties to incrementally
add functionality to a module without replacing it completely.
</ul>
<p>
<b>INTERFACE DESCRIPTION</b>
<p>
The development of the EMC architecture, shown in <A HREF="#Fig1">Figure 1</A>, was the first step
toward defining an interface specification. In this figure, boxes indicate the
individual modules for which interfaces have been defined and validated. These
include Task Sequencing, Trajectory Generation, Servo Control, and Discrete
Input/Output. The Operator Interface, shown at the side, does not require any
specific interfaces itself, but can be developed using only the interfaces
provided by the other modules. Implementations of the operator interface need
only avail themselves of messages to the controller and data provided by the
controller: no additional interfaces are required to be defined in order to
incorporate an operator interface into an EMC controller.<p>

<ul>
<b>Figure 1.</b> The EMC Architecture. Interfaces for Task Sequencing,
Trajectory Generation, and Servo Control were targeted during the validation
process.</ul>
The interface specifications are formalized in the C++ programming language,
using header files. The specification consists of messages into each module,
and world model data provided by each module. Both the messages and world model
data are implemented using C++ classes.<p>
Class definitions alone are not sufficient to describe the interfaces. The
specification needed to include the expected behavior of the control modules in
response to each control message, and their effect on the world model of each
control module. This information is provided in manual-style pages accompanying
the C++ class definitions, using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format.<p>
Supplementing the message specification is a model of data transfer, the
Neutral Manufacturing Language (NML) [<A HREF="#Ref4">4</A>]. This model provides for "mailboxes"
of data, with one or more readers and writers. Each module is modeled as a
cyclic process, which reads its input command from its supervisor, reads the
status of its subordinates (or sensors), and computes and sends outputs to its
subordinates (or actuators).<p>
The interface specification is divided into two parts: commands that each
module will perform, and status that each module will maintain. Both commands
and status are derived from the NML message base class, and require a unique
identifier and zero or more data fields representing the parameters to the
command or fields in the status. During the development of the specification,
the intent was to analyze the general requirements of each module in terms of
which commands it should be responsible for carrying out, and what world model
status it should be responsible for maintaining. Ideally, the specification
would be complete enough to never require modifications. In the case of the
Servo Control module, a literature survey conducted over a period of years
resulted in a cataloguing of 62 algorithms, and a generalization of an
interface to this module that would support implementation of the servo control
function with any of these algorithms. However, no matter how comprehensive
such a survey, new algorithms will inevitably arise which require input data or
provide output data that are not available in the interface. Because of this,
extensions to the interfaces are anticipated. Indeed, the need for extensions
was evidenced during several of the validation tests discussed in subsequent
sections of this paper.
<p>
<b>SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE
</b>
<p>
A central problem faced when developing the interfaces was eliminating
suppositions for computing platforms, operating systems, and programming
languages. Already one can see that the C++ form of the interfaces presumes a
programming language. Vendors of modules (toward whom these interfaces are
aimed) need to provide the command initiation functions and world model access
functions for the platforms the vendors have selected. This does not prevent
developers from using another language for the implementation (e.g., the
graphical user interface was coded in Microsoft Visual Basic in this case), but
it does require that the external interfaces be C++-linkable.<p>
The picture is complicated when considering how one assembles a system with
components that provide these interfaces. For example, as seen in Figure 1, the
Trajectory Generator module supervises the Servo Control module, typically
generating points in a world coordinate system and sending them to the Servo
Control subordinate. However, the Trajectory Generator cannot, in general, call
functions provided by the Servo Controller, since the Trajectory Generator may
be running on a different computer than the Servo Controller.<p>
This problem is one aspect of the more general configuration problem, which
leads to the question, "What services can be expected in an open architecture
controller that allow components to interoperate?" Aside from a vendor's need
to access memory, disk files, timers, and other operating system resources,
there is more required from the support infrastructure as the example above
illustrates.<p>
Because we needed to implement controllers for various machines to embark on
the validation effort, we required some particular support infrastructure. We
used the NIST RCS Library [<A HREF="Ref4">4</A>], which has been ported to a variety of computing
platforms, and directly supports the RCS methodology for implementing real-time
control systems by providing a uniform programming interface to communication,
timing, shared memory, and mutual exclusion primitives. However, by selecting
this library, we sidestepped an important problem: which support infrastructure
should be presumed (and indeed accompany) the interface specification?
Architectures exist which can serve the purpose, such as the Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) [<A HREF="Ref5">5</A>] from the Object Management Group, but
requiring a particular infrastructure greatly constrains the potential spectrum
of applications. Resolving this problem was outside the scope of this effort.
<p>
<b>VALIDATION TESTS
</b>
<p>
The interface validation tests were conducted in testbeds at NIST in
Gaithersburg, Maryland and at the General Motors Powertrain facility in
Pontiac, Michigan. At NIST, the testbed consisted of a UNIX workstation
simulation for initial development, and a two-computer controller for run-time
tests on a desktop milling machine (minimill). The graphical user interface ran
on Microsoft Windows on the first computer, and the real-time controller ran on
a UNIX operating system on the second computer. Communication between the two
took place via ethernet. In Pontiac, the testbed consisted of the same
dual-computer controller as for the minimill, running a Kearney &amp; Trecker
800 4-axis horizontal machining center. In this case, the two computers shared
a split backplane, yet still were bridged via ethernet.<p>
The use of multiple platforms for development was enabled by the RCS Library,
which had already been ported to the platforms selected. The key to ensuring
that the control code remained portable was to restrict all programming calls
to the ANSI C++ language and the RCS Library. By doing this, porting the
control code from one platform to another required only a recompile.<p>
The exception to this was the graphics system, programmed explicitly for
Microsoft Windows. Initially, we attempted to define a programmer's interface
to the common functionality of windowing systems, implementing it for the
Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and X Windows. If programmers wrote only to this
API, then porting the graphics code would only require a recompile. Despite its
obvious benefits, this approach suffers from a significant drawback:
programming support tools tailored to specific windowing systems accelerate
development of these applications to the degree that coding by hand to a
functional API takes far more time.<p>
Three tests were selected that together exercised the specification's support
for open features: the development of a graphical user interface; selection
between two commercial motion control products; and the addition of probing
capabilities.
<p>
<b>Independent Graphic User Interface
</b>
<p>
Although a graphical user interface (GUI) is a necessary component of a machine
tool controller, there were no specific command initiation functions or world
model access functions defined for the GUI proper. The GUI execution followed a
cycle in which operator input such as button presses or keyboard input were
read, the NML messages for the appropriate control module were sent to the
controller, and the world model status for all the modules in the controller
was read and displayed. Because the NML classes for control messages and world
model data had already been defined, there was no need to develop any
additional NML classes for the GUI.<p>
The GUI itself was written in Microsoft Visual BASIC, by programmers familiar
with the language and with access to a version of the C++ header files for
Microsoft Windows. After designing the GUI, programmers developed a working
interface that linked to the RCS Libraries which provided transparent,
cross-platform information sharing and worked on both the UNIX simulation,
minimill controller, and K &amp; T 800 controller interchangeably. Some results
of this validation:<p>
1.	A version of the C++ header files needed to be provided for Microsoft
Windows. This points out the inevitable choice of supported platforms control
vendors must make. Had we not provided these for this platform, the developers
of the GUI would have been forced to select another.<p>
2.	The interface to the controller included information such as filename
parameters which presumed the existence of a filesystem shared between the
controller and the GUI. This forces any implementation of a controller which
supports these interfaces to provide a file system.<p>
3.	The need for an interface specification to the GUI did arise. In many cases,
the controller needs to query the operator for information, or to prompt the
operator to perform a manual task such as fixturing. As a result, we needed to
augment the interface specification with a command to the operator interface to
present instructions, and world model data containing the results of the manual
operation.<p>
4.	The interface specification provides for status and error reporting in each
module's world model. Unfortunately, the mechanism for reporting errors
presumes the mailbox model of communication, which does not queue information.
In the case of error reporting, a queued history is required. Because of this,
an explicit queued model for error reporting was incorporated into the
specification.
<p>
<b>Motion System Interoperability
</b>
<p>
In order to test interoperability, we selected two commercial motion control
boards which each aggregated servo control and trajectory planning
functionality, and wrote interface functions which implemented the command
initiation functions and world model status functions for each. Using these
interface functions, the test consisted of running the controller with one
motion control board, powering down, linking in the interface code for the
second motion control board, and running the controller again.<p>
This test brought to the fore one of the central issues in developing an
architecture and its associated interface specification: once particular
modules have been defined, what functionality should be assumed of them? Two
approaches highlight the extreme viewpoints. The first takes the position that
the definition should include all possible functionality, and that in virtually
no case will a product support the entire functionality. This eliminates the
need to extend the interface, but it raises the possibility that products will
not interoperate if one assumes functionality of another that is not provided.
The second supposes minimal functionality, assuming that all products will
support it entirely. However, such a minimal interface specification would
surely beg for extensions as more and more products incorporate technology not
reflected in the minimal specification.<p>
Because of the drawbacks in each approach, there is no clear answer to the
question. In our case, we assumed that any particular scope of functionality
would be too broad for some, and too narrow for others. Thus,we needed to
determine mechanisms for both extending the interface and providing some
configuration methodology that would codify the extent of functionality various
products provided so that gaps would be obvious before integration began.<p>
Our test highlighted a difference in the abilities of each product to plan
smooth transitions between linear and circular-arc motion. We chose this
specific instance as a chance to determine a configuration methodology that
would list the suppositions on module behavior, and require that a conformance
document be provided for each board that indicated conformance with each
behavior. These files serve two purposes. First, they can be used to determine
incompatibilities by the system designer before the arise in the field, and
perhaps more importantly, they can be accessed at run time for diagnostics
purposes.<p>
When developing a general specification based on implementation experiences,
there is a tendency for machine-specific and component-specific dependencies to
be inadvertently incorporated. One example resulted from a peculiarity in the
Kearney &amp; Trecker 800 horizontal machining center which required that the
single rotary axis be interfaced to different motion control hardware than the
three Cartesian axes. Although there was no effect on the interface to the
Trajectory Generation or Servo Control modules, the separation was evidenced in
the implementations of the command initiation functions and world model access
functions for each motion control board. Since these functions are akin to
device drivers, one would expect that they would be provided by the vendors of
the motion control products. However, this puts the burden on the vendor to
customize their driver for each machine, which defeats the purpose of standard
interfaces.<p>
A solution is to make the separation in the Task Sequencer, whose logic already
contains machine configuration information. In this case, motion control of the
rotary axis is implemented with one component and motion control of the three
Cartesian axes with a second, and this split is reflected not in the Trajectory
Controller implementation but as two motion subordinates to the Task Sequencer.
<p>
<b>Probing Extensions
</b>
<p>
Extensibility is perhaps the most difficult feature to achieve, primarily
because of the impact it has throughout the controller. Adding capabilities to
an open architecture controller will, in general, require extending the
interface specification and extending each module to reflect the new ability of
the controller. As a validation test for extensibility, touch-trigger probing
and continuous analog probing were added to the existing EMC implementation.<p>
Touch-trigger probing requires that the controller latch the axis positions in
the servo controller in response to a trigger signal. The latched positions
must then be saved, and the motion halted immediately. Continuous analog
probing incorporates an analog probe into the latching, so that the trigger
signal calls for simultaneous latching of the axis positions and the probe
output. As with touch-trigger probing, data must be saved and motion halted.<p>
The impact was broad. Although the interface specification already included the
command initiation functions and world model access functions for touch-trigger
probing, continuous analog probing was not anticipated by the developers of the
interfaces and needed to be added to the trajectory planner and servo control
modules. This addition merely allowed the probing to be specified. The existing
interface functions to the motion control hardware needed to be modified so
that the specified functionality could be accomplished. This did not require
access to the source code of the existing implementation in this case, although
in cases where the added functionality could interfere with resources used for
existing functionality it would be necessary.<p>
Within the Task Sequencer, two modifications were necessary. First, the part
program interpreter required a language update that allowed probing to be
specified. The language itself contained provisions for adding new statements,
since this was anticipated. Had it not been extensible, the source code would
be required. Using the same approach, the sequencer itself was augmented with
logic to halt the trajectory controller when the trigger condition was
observed.<p>
It is highly desirable to avoid the disclosure of source code in an open
controller because it is sensitive intellectual property. The approach often
taken, as above, is to provide interface points throughout the controller,
commonly called "hooks," to which extended functionality can be attached. The
advantage is that source code need not be disclosed. The disadvantage is that
if the designers of the original controller chose not to place hooks in a

<CENTER><H1>THE ENHANCED MACHINE CONTROLLER (EMC)</H1>
<P><HR><P>
<H2>The Next Generation of Factory Controllers</H2>
<P><HR SIZE=5><P></CENTER>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

In 1980, the United States manufactured nearly half of the machine tools in the
world. Today, our market share is 10%. Because machine tool technology is
critical for both civilian and military uses, it is important to recapture some
of this market. <P>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Reduce the life-cycle cost of machine tool controllers by developing modular
interface specifications which support interoperability of key controller
components.
<LI>Validate the interface specifications on a broad class of machines in
production applications.
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/EMC.gif">
Because the controller can change the capabilities of a machine tool, it is a
critical component of the machining process. Currently, competition is based on
controller hardware. The Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC) project concentrates
on controller software, an area where the U.S. still has a commanding lead.<p>

Operational controllers based on the EMC interfaces have been developed and
installed on laboratory testbeds at NIST and on production equipment at General
Motors Powertrain and Boeing Aircraft Corporation. These controllers are
comprised of basic controller components: trajectory generator, servo control,
part program interpreter, operator interface, and programmable logic controller.<p>

We will work closely with machine tool builders and users and control component
manufacturers, through a collaboration consortium which we will establish under a
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). Each member's
requirements and needs will be taken into account during the course of the
project.<p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<b>Reduced Life Cycle Costs</b>

<UL>
<LI>Development costs will be reduced because off-the-shelf components will be
available from multiple sources. Less engineering time will be required to
integrate these components into systems.
<LI>Training costs will be reduced because the operator interface can be
customized to emulate widely used and familiar operator controls.
<LI>Maintenance costs will be lower due to multi-vendor sourcing, reduced lead
time for components, and inventory reduction.<BR>
</UL>

<b>Reduced Integration Costs</b>

<UL>
<LI>Sensors can easily be added to enhance capabilities.
<LI>Programming language dialects will be easily supported without system
redesign.
<LI>A large pool of potential developers will provide innovative technology.
<LI>More flexible controllers will produce higher quality parts at lower
cost.<BR>
</UL>

<B>Improved Performance</B>

<UL>
<LI>Thermal and geometric error compensation will improve accuracy up to 20
times without warm-up.
<LI>Contouring rates will be improved by a factor of 2 to 20.
<LI>Shorter part programs will result from using non-uniform rational B-splines
(NURBS) as a representation for specifying paths.
<LI>Safety will be improved by using an identification system to verify tool
selection.
</UL>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

A vertical machining center used in a shop-floor environment is providing
empirical evidence of such machine tool enhancements as thermal and geometric
error correction. This effort is complemented by the interface definition and
validation process.<p>

In cooperation with the Department of Energy Technologies Enabling Agile
Manufacturing (TEAM) program, candidate Application Programming Interfaces are
being developed and validated in production applications.
A controller based on the APIs has been installed at the General Motors
Powertrain Division with cooperation from GM/Hughes. The goal is to demonstrate
plug and play interoperability between such components as motion control and
discrete input/output. The results of this evaluation will be incorporated into
procurement specifications for the next generation of machining transfer lines at
General Motors.<p>

A second installation at the Boeing Aircraft Company is targeting a 5-axis
machining center. Using the APIs for the part program interpreter, motion
control, and discrete input/output modules, an interpreter for the RS-274
language dialect was written by NIST which interoperates with
commercially-available trajectory planning software.<p>

Within NIST, the EMC interface specifications are being applied to a broader
class of machines: robots, coordinate measuring machines, and Stewart platform
machining centers and cranes. Currently, the APIs are being extended to include
task- and workstation-level control for a coordinate measuring machine as part of
the Next Generation Inspection System.<p>

<H2>High Speed Inspection of Manufactured Parts</H2>
<P><HR SIZE=5><P></CENTER>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/NGIS1.gif">
In-process and post-process inspection with Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs)
often slows progress of delivering finished parts to the loading dock. The
inspection of parts with complex geometry, where closely spaced inspection points
are needed, is especially time consuming.<p>

Current CMMs rely almost entirely on touch-trigger probes. These probes, which
produce single point measurements, are limited in the rate of data acquisition
and the type of information that can be obtained. Also, part set-up can be
time-consuming for small-batch parts. Although the speed and density of data
collection can be greatly increased with advanced optical, analog touch, and
analog capacitance sensors, these sensors often cannot be integrated into
existing controllers due to closed or proprietary controller architectures. 
Furthermore, inspection data cannot be easily and quickly exported from the CMM
for use in factory analysis algorithms that influence manufacturing quality
control.<p>

Open system architecture controllers will permit easier integration of advanced
sensors into CMMs and will also promote easier and more efficient integration of
other controller components, such as motion control, obstacle avoidance, CAD
software, and operator interface components.<p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Maintain a next generation inspection testbed for experimenting with open
architecture controllers, interface standards, and multiple advanced sensors.
<LI>Achieve fast, accurate, and flexible coordinate measurement of
complex-geometry manufactured parts.
<UL>
<LI>Fast: 2 orders of magnitude increase in speed over touch trigger
probing; minimize part set-up time.
<LI>Accurate: Maintain today's accuracy; achieve high density data
acquisition.
<LI>Flexible: Easy to measure new part shapes.
</UL>
<LI>Work on projects with industry and effect technology transfer.<p>
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/NGIS3.gif">
A testbed has been assembled that consists of a CMM, advanced sensors, and the
NIST Real Time Control System (RCS) open architecture controller. The advanced
sensors include analog touch probes, a video camera, an analog capacitance probe
and a laser triangulation probe.<p>

The RCS controller permits real-time processing of sensor data for feedback
control of the inspection probe. The controller also permits integration of a
video camera for part feature recognition and for vision-guided motion control of
the inspection probe. The controller will provide interfaces to Product Data
Exchange using Step data representations and to the Dimensional Measuring
Interface Standard to allow inspection that is driven by model data.<p>

A pre-commercial Next Generation Inspection System (NGIS) will be tested and
evaluated in a production environment. All NGIS technology developed at NIST will
be transferred to the marketplace through a number of vendors.<p>

NIST is collaborating with both the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences
(NCMS), NGIS consortium, and the Consortium for Non-Contact Gauging, which is
working on the Rapid Agile Metrology for Manufacturing (RAMM) project.<p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The next generation of inspection systems will contribute to higher
quality products, greater productivity, and reduced time-to-market through:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Faster inspection.
<LI>Reduced part set-up time.
<LI>High density data acquisition
<LI>Greater flexibility in part geometries
<LI>Ability to inspect complex-geometry parts rapidly
<LI>Better integration of computer-based inspection systems into the factory
through: (a) Use of part models for inspection programming and results analysis;
(b) Standardized data formats for inspection results; (c) Providing feedback of
inspection results to manufacturing processes.
</UL></UL>

Open architecture standards for CMM controllers will lead to better systems for
users, easier and faster integration of component systems, more market
opportunities for component suppliers, and lower prices through increased
competition.<p>

NIST collaboration with the NCMS and RAMM consortium companies will result in
commercialization of next generation inspection systems by providing direct links
into industry and efficient means for technology transfer to these organizations.<p>


<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

A CMM inspection testbed has been established and sensor-servoed probing of
complex surfaces has been demonstated. The current state of the project is as
follows: <p>

<UL>
<LI>A Sheffield Cordax CMM has been retrofitted with VME hardware and a PC
computer.
<LI>A NIST hierarchical open architecture controller has been built and
demonstrated.
<LI>An API 3-D analog touch probe and an Extrude Hone MIDAS probe have been
integrated into the system. The ability to scan surfaces using closed loop
feedback on probe data, while servoing on probe height, has been demonstrated
with each of these probes.  
<LI>Real-time data collection of machine axis and sensor data during the scans
has been demonstrated. The part inspection data can then be immediately plotted.
<LI>Cameras and vision processing hardware have been integrated into the system.
Vision processing algorithms to extract edges of machined parts have been
demonstrated, as has the ability to track a moving touch probe in the imagery. 
<LI>A world model for filtering, prediction, and conversion from image to
machine coordinates has been integrated.
<LI>Full integration between the vision, world model and CMM arm/probe systems
has been achieved. Using real-time vision, the probe is guided to the edge of the
part while it scans along the surface recording measurements. The probe is then
instructed to shift over and scan back, achieving a vision-guided raster scan of
the part surface.
<LI>A Graphical User Interface has been demonstrated.

<H2>The Shape of a New Machine</H2>
<P><HR SIZE=5><P></CENTER>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Rapid production of quality contoured parts requires machine tools that combine
speed, accuracy, stiffness and multiaxis versatility. In addition, manufacturers
look for qualities such as ease of installation and movability to enable plants
to be reconfigured to meet changing market demands. A new class of
parallel-actuated machine tools based on the Stewart platform mechanism presents
new possibilities for meeting these needs.<p>

NIST is working with several machine tool builders and users who expect
developments in this field to be an important factor to achieve future
productivity gains. Industry and government researchers are cooperating to
explore the limits of new machine configurations in terms of positioning accuracy
and resolution, calibration, and advanced control. Customers have shown a great
deal of interest in future applications of the new machines.<p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Investigate the application of new structural configurations 	and
advanced control strategies to machine tools.
<LI>dentify and extend the limits of capability of a new class of machine tools based on parallel kinematics.
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/Hexapod1sm.gif">
NIST has begun developing an Advanced Machine Tool Structures Testbed (AMTST) by
procuring an experimental prototype Octahedral-Hexapod.<p>
AMTST research will focus on:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Adapting the ANSI/ASME B5.54-1991 Standard on Method for 	Performance
Evaluation of Computer Numerically Controlled 	Machining Centers to the unique
geometry of this new class of 	machine tools.
<LI>Providing parallel-actuated machines with higher resolution 	and more
accurate position sensing capability.
<LI>Applying piezoelectric or similar microactuators to achieve extremely fine
positioning resolution.
<LI>Developing and applying open architecture controller 	technology (based
on the Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC) Architecture) to allow integration
of third-party software and to implement experimental servo control
algorithms.
</UL>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Machine tools with parallel kinematic structures may significantly increase
machine tool stiffness over conventional designs. Machining motions can have six
degrees of freedom that, provide versatility for machining sculpted shapes.<p>

Additionally, the machine tools are expected to be less expensive to produce and
install. The machine symmetry may reduce the effect of thermal deformation of the
frame. The symmetry of the machine tool structure and actuators can save money.
Another benefit is that no specially-built foundation is required in many cases.<p>

Research at the NIST/AMTST will:
<UL>
<LI>Result in new performance evaluation techniques to 	compare different
variations of these new types of machines.
<LI>Provide a metrology system capable of high-resolution measurement of
actuator strut lengths.
<LI>Investigate the use of microactuation for precise motions and vibration
control.
<LI>Develop an EMC controller implementation for machine tools 	with parallel
kinematics and macro/microactuation.
<LI>Allow machine tool users to gain first-hand experience with this new technology.
</UL>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="/graphics/brochure/Hexapod3sm.gif">
This project is a collaborative effort involving all the divisions of the
Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory.<p>

As part of the planning process for the AMTST, a Workshop on Advanced Machine
Tool Structures: Research Directions was held at NIST in April, 1994. This
workshop brought together representatives of industry and government
organizations to discuss the research activities to be conducted in the AMTST.<p>

NIST purchased and installed an Ingersoll Octahedral and an additional strut on a
test stand in the AMTST in May, 1995. The first test part cut on the machine at
NIST, a circle-diamond-square based on the NAS-979 standard, was machined on June
8, 1995. <p>

Baseline metrology and machining tests are currently being performed on the full
machine. Metrology and microactuation enhancements are being developed for the
test strut. Several collaborative projects are being undertaken with industry and
university partners. These projects will investigate such areas as the machining
of challenging parts, developing and evaluating new calibration tools and
techniques, and modeling and simulating parallel structure machines. As one of
the initial projects within the National Advanced Manufacturing Testbed (NAMT),
new modes of interaction and tools for collaboration will be explored for working
with industry and university partners to achieve the goals of this unique machine
tool research facility.<p>

<H2>An Integration Testbed for Large-Scale Manufacturing and Construction
Automation</H2>
<P><HR SIZE=5><P></CENTER>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Industry needs open-system architecture standards for sensor-interactive
intelligent machine systems used in large-scale manufacturing and construction.
Without interface standards, it is difficult to integrate subsystems into
intelligent machine systems, or to expand capabilities by adding components.
These difficulties lead to limited system functionality, long development times,
and high cost. The need is for standard interfaces for commercially available
"plug-and-play" components.<p>

Within open system architectures, functional control modules will have
abilities to:
<UL>
<LI>Manipulate large heavy objects precisely to permit rapid semi-automated
assembly of large structures.
<LI>Manipulate tools precisely to perform machining and finishing operations on
large structures.
<LI>Detect obstacles and avoid collisions in complex dynamic environments.
<LI>Operate safely and reliably in unstructured environments despite
perturbations, such as sway and oscillations induced by load accelerations or by
wind and wave action.
<LI>Also, the construction and large-scale manufacturing industries need
innovative machine designs to remain competitive and to open new markets upon
technology advancement.
</UL>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Test and validate open-systems architectures for intelligent machines and
systems that manipulate heavy objects and tools over large work volumes.
<LI>Work with industry by applying RoboCrane technology to practical
applications.
<LI>Explore the development of innovative machine designs for large-scale
manufacturing and construction.
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/Robocrane2.gif">
A RoboCrane testbed is being constructed with six degrees-of-freedom control of a
work platform suspended by cables driven by winches under computer control. This
testbed will be controlled by a PC based Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC)
incorporating a Real-Time Control System (RCS) reference model open-system
architecture. The controller will have standard interfaces between functional
modules for servo control, trajectory generation, constrained motion modes,
discrete event logic, task sequencing, and an operator interface that
incorporates the following elements: joystick control, a graphics programming
environment, and a telepresence vision system with virtual reality displays that
facilitate remote control by human operators.<p>

A variety of sensors and control methodologies will be tested. Proposed standards
for databases and interfaces will be evaluated.<p>

NIST will work closely with crane manufacturers and potential users to transfer
early versions of this technology into practical applications such as
construction of highway bridges, radioactive waste clean-up, and undersea salvage
operations.<p>


<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The adoption of open-system architecture standards for large-scale manufacturing
and construction operations will lead to more efficient systems for users,
greater market opportunities for equipment manufacturers, and lower costs due to
greater competition between suppliers.<p>

Interface standards will mean easier, faster, and more robust integration of
subsystems, less expensive customization of intelligent machine systems used in
multiple applications, and lower costs for spare parts and system up-grades.<p>

Emerging markets for large-scale intelligent machines include manufacture of
aircraft, ships, and railroad rolling stock; construction and maintenance of
buildings, highways, and bridges; environmental clean-up of radioactive or toxic
waste sites; and undersea mining, construction, repair, and salvage operations.<p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

A six-meter RoboCrane testbed has been constructed. It can precisely manipulate
bridge elements, cast iron pipes, steel beams, fifty-five gallon drums, and
performs precise mating and joining operations. Power tools such as grinders,
welders, and saws have also been manipulated.<p>

One-and two-operator six-axis joystick interfaces have been implemented. A
commercial IGRIP graphics programming system has been installed. A LabView
development and diagnostic display has been incorporated into the operator
interface. An EMC controller with a CANbus sensor/effector interface is being
installed as part of the open-system architecture standards adoption. A vision
system is being designed to provide the operator with full control capability
from a remote location. A foveal-peripheral camera system is to be maneuvered by
mimicking operator head motion allowing a more natural and semiautomatic camera
positioning system. Virtual reality and graphic overlays will give the operator
the ability to visualize information available from CAD databases and other
sources such as a site metrology system, and to overlay such information on live
TV images of the real work environment.<p>

	<DT><EM>Twelfth Symposium on Computational Geometry </EM>(May 1996)</DT>
	<DL><DT>We present a new strategy for a robot to find its position on a map,
	where the map is represented as a geometric tree.  We use the framework of 
	competitive analysis to analyze the performance of our strategy and show 
	that the distance traveled by the robot is at most square root of <EM>n</EM>
	times longer than the shortest possible route to localize the robot, where 
	<EM>n</EM> is the number of vertices of the tree.  This is a significant
        improvement over the best known previous bound of <EM>n^(2/3)</EM>, and
	since there is a lower bound of square root of n, our strategy is optimal.

<LI><DT><B>Localizing a Robot with Minimum Travel</B></DT>
	<DT><EM>SIAM Journal on Computing</EM> - to appear</DT>
	<DL><DT>We consider the problem of localizing a robot in a known environment.
	We assume that the robot has a map and a compass and can ``see'' walls
	using a range sensing device.  By moving around and using range sensing, 
	the robot can determine possibilities for its position in the map.  The 
	goal is to minimize the distance that the robot travels in order to exactly

	<DL><DT>We examine the complexity of testing different control
	flow statements of standard programming languages by defining a
	complexity measure that is similar to the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
	dimension used in computational learning theory and applying it 
	to different control flow statements and combinations of statements.  
	This measure gives bounds on the number of random test points needed 
	to determine that a program is approximately correct, and thus it 
	gives insight into the relative difficulty of testing different 
	program constructions.

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The Intelligent Systems Division's (ISD) research and development program focuses
on addressing pressing and long-term industry needs for: <p>

<UL>
<LI>Open-systems architecture standards
<LI>Intelligent controllers for industrial applications
<LI>Engineering methodologies and software tools
<LI>Advanced measurement technologies, metrics, and performance measures
<LI>Innovative next generation industrial machines.
</UL>

development tools
<LI>Large-scale manufacturing, construction, and shipbuilding industries
<LI>Other government agencies, academia, and other users of intelligent systems
technologies.
</UL>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The mission of the Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) is to strive to enhance
U.S. industrial competitiveness by developing interface standards, infrastructure
technologies, and performance measures to support industry's needs for
intelligent systems and sensor based automation in manufacturing.<p>

Our intelligent systems R&D program goals include:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Open-Systems - Accelerated introduction of new technologies through "plug
and play" software and components
<LI>Modularity - Off-the-shelf components and software that is available from
multiple suppliers
<LI>Interoperability - Integration of factory floor machines, operations and
data 
<LI>Extensibility - Performance upgrades by adding sensors, computing power,
communications and control features
<LI>Portability - Software that is portable to different hardware platforms
<LI>Quality and Safety - In-process inspection and monitoring through
sensor-based control
<LI>Technology Diffusion - New and enhanced computer-aided engineering tools and
information exchange
<LI>Innovative Technologies - Next generation industrial metrology, machines,
and systems.
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/Intelligentsys.gif">

The technical thrust areas of our current research and development program are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Open architecture standards for intelligent controllers
<LI>Reference model architecture for intelligent manufacturing systems
<LI>Integration testbeds for standards validation and testing
</UL>

ISD employs a multi-disciplinary team of research engineers to maintain
competence in intelligent machines and systems, robotics, real-time
sensory-interactive control, open-architectures, software development techniques,
simulation and modeling, and methods for intelligent system design and testing. 
Our current research program focuses on developing and demonstrating the
"Intelligent Systems Architecture for Manufacturing (ISAM)."  ISAM serves as a
reference model architecture for intelligent manufacturing systems.<p>

To accomplish our goals in these technical areas, ISD is structured in groups
that are aligned with the functional elements of intelligent systems.  ISD has
groups in Machine Systems, Control Systems, Systems Integration, Perception
Systems, and Knowledge Systems.<p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

U.S. manufacturing industries are engaged in a global competition to increase
productivity and to prosper in the world market.  Manufacturing industries
represent about 19% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or around $1.1
trillion of goods and services produced each year.  Each percentage point
improvement in manufacturing productivity growth rate produces over $10 billion
increase in the nation's rate of wealth production.   Intelligent systems
technology,  particularly intelligent automation for manufacturing, holds
enormous potential to increase productivity, improve quality, precision and
reliability, to lower costs, and to shorten time from design to market.  In turn,
improvements in manufacturing productivity, quality, safety, and environmental
protection lead to improved quality of life for all citizens.<p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Our FY 1996 accomplishments include:

<UL>
<LI>Enhanced Machine Controller operational at the General Motors Powertrain
Division to evaluate open architecture specifications
<LI>A next generation CMM testbed has been established and sensor-servoed
probing has been demonstrated
<LI>The Automated Deburring and Chamfering System (ADACS) has been completed and
demonstrated at Pratt & Whitney
<LI>An experimental Ingersoll Octahedral Hexapod milling machine has been
installed as part of a National Advanced Manufacturing Testbed (NAMT)
<LI>A RoboCrane integration testbed has been developed for large scale
manufacturing applications
<LI>An outdoor mobility testbed has been developed for unmanned vehicle
applications.

<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The parts finishing process needs to be automated because:<p>
<UL>
<LI>Manual deburring and chamfering is time-consuming, inconsistent, and
can damage expensive parts beyond repair.
<LI>Annual deburring costs are currently estimated at $3.9 billion nationwide,
or 35% of the total cost of manufacturing finished parts. 	These costs include
the time required to finish a part at 	the bench, the cost of a thorough
inspection, the possible 	subsequent rework, and sometimes even scrapping of
the component
<LI>Manual deburring procedures can result in cumulative trauma disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
</UL>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Develop an automated finishing system for high-tolerance turbofan and
turbojet aircraft engine components and helicopter drive components.
<LI>Reduce finishing costs by 50%.
<LI>Reduce rework rates to nearly 0% from the current 10% to 30% level.
<LI>Hold tolerances on the finished edge to less than 0.07 mm (0.003 in).
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>
<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/ADACS.gif">
To produce the tolerances required for aerospace components, the ADACS was
developed as a two component system. A robot or machine tool is used to carry an
active deburring tool to the part.  An active deburring tool, the Chamfering and
Deburring End-of-Arm Tool (CADET), was developed by United Technologies Research
Center (UTRC) for the ADACS project.  The CADET incorporates a two-axis gimbal
which permits movement of the tool tip in a direction perpendicular to the
spindle axis over a one-square-inch area. The CADET's high bandwidth force servo
receives force and direction commands from the machine controller telling the
CADET where the edge is and what cutting force to maintain.  Each element is
controlled separately. The system is coordinated by the NIST-developed
hierarchical Real-time Control System (RCS). RCS allows feedback from a variety of sensors. This is
easily integrated with the control of the robot, accommodating for robot
inaccuracies which may result from off-line programming. <p>

The ADACS has two operator interface levels. The first is a developer level. A
part finishing program developer, such as a manufacturing engineer, programs the
finishing path trajectories for each part on a CAD-based workcell simulation
environment. The program includes geometrical information, such as features that
require finishing, and machining information, such as chamfer depth, feed rate,
and type of cut. The program developer graphically simulates all trajectories to
detect any collisions within the workspace and to minimize cycle time. After the
program developer has accepted the finishing program, it is downloaded to a file.
The second operator interface level is for the user. An operator on the factory
floor runs the finishing program and graphically monitors the parameters of the
process. The operator is able to temporarily modify the feed rate if the required
tolerances are not being met.  ADACS is a joint project, conducted under a
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), between NIST, UTRC, and
Pratt & Whitney. NIST is responsible for developing the advanced CAD-directed,
sensor-based control system which coordinates the operations of the robot and the
deburring tool. UTRC is responsible for developing the deburring process model
and fabrication of an enhanced deburring tool. Pratt & Whitney has installed a
prototype deburring cell at their East Hartford plant.<p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The Automated Deburring and Chamfering System will reduce manufacturing
costs through:
<UL>
<LI>Increased quality and dimensional consistency.
<LI>Increased throughput.
<LI>Decreased rework and scrap.
<LI>Reduced direct manual labor
</UL>
Finishing costs are expected to be reduced by as much as 50% and rework rates to
be reduced to nearly zero. <p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>A Real Time Control System (RCS) based on the Enhanced Machine Tool
Controller (EMC) open architecture has been developed to control and coordinate
each workstation device. A CAD/CAM graphical user interface allows the programmer
to program the required trajectories off-line by graphically selecting which
edges are to be chamfered and specifying the machining parameters to produce the
required chamfer.  The workstation has produced uniform chamfers of 0.25 mm
(0.010 in) on test parts.
<LI>UTRC, working under a NIST contract, has developed a next    generation
Chamfering and Deburring End-of-arm Tool  (CADET) incorporating voice coil
actuators to apply a constant  force to the part's edge. The design and
development of the CADET   stemmed from dynamic calibration tests that were
performed by NIST researchers.
<LI>The ADACS has been applied to several motion platforms.  The CADET has been
integrated with robots at NIST and UTRC.  A robotic platform allows the ability
to finish complex 3 dimensional components that a 3 axis machine tool could not
reach.  The CADET has also been integrated with a machining center at Pratt &
Whitney in East Hartford, CT.  A machine tool platform allows the ability of
performing a finishing operation on the same machine that the machining occurs. 
The CADET could be mounted directly within the tool carousel and used similarly
to a conventional cutter, but with the added capability to actively adapt to
variations in edge location.
<LI>Sikorsky Helicopter is currently investigating the use of a robotic
implementation of the ADACS for helicopter engine drive components in its East
Hartford, CT plant.
<LI>Efforts are currently underway to locate potential vendors to commercialize
the technology developed under the ADACS program.

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

At present, the vast majority of software products are painstakingly hand-crafted
and monolithic.   Individual pieces of software are very difficult, if not
impossible, to reuse.   New technologies that address the challenges of improving
the productivity of creating software-intensive systems are needed. The
technologies would enable builders of software systems to select and purchase
individual components which best suit their system's requirements. Based on their
specifications, software components would be selected, similarly to hardware
components. Future existing software tools will facilitate or even automate the
matching of components to applications and the composition of the custom systems.<P>

The NIST Advanced Technology Program Focused Program on Component-Based Software
specifically targets developing new technologies that will increase productivity,
reliability, and reusability within the U.S. software industry.  The Intelligent
Systems Division received ATP funding for researching and developing functional
specifications for intelligent control system software components. <p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Develop a set of functional specifications for intelligent control software
components. To apply the research to a concrete problem, we will focus on a
particular class of algorithms that perform perceptual processing and world model
maintenance.
<LI>Identify and enumerate all of the critical characteristics necessary to
describe the algorithms in the chosen class.   The identifying characteristics
should be distinct enough to describe the algorithm's capabilities, limitations,
and interfaces.
<LI>Investigate how the functional specifications for the part pose estimation
algorithms can be integrated with a real-time control development tool.
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>
<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/Functionalspec.gif">
<UL>
<LI> Select a neutral, machine-independent methodology to convey the functional
specifications.
<LI>Focus the problem domain on a particular family of algorithms that estimate
the 2D pose of a known part on a work surface, using vision processing.   The
selected algorithm family is believed to be rich enough to ensure a sufficiently
complex set of functionality to be specified.  Potential aspects of an algorithm
that would be interesting may include:  types of sensory input accepted, types of
geometries supported, robustness, performance characteristics, and supported
platforms.
<LI>Initially describe in English the functional specifications.  This will
provide interesting results that are useful in analyzing algorithms of this
particular class.
<LI>Apply the trial neutral description language to the functional
specifications. Evaluate the adequacy of the language to describe the
functionality and characteristics, its ability to convey meaning to a human
evaluator, and its potential for incorporation in an automated or semi-automated
composition tool.
<LI>Publish the specifications, both in English and in the selected format(s). 
Target distribution to an audience that would be interested in applying these
types of algorithms.
</UL>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Rigorously capturing and enumerating the salient aspects about an algorithm will
be valuable to the component software community, as well as to researchers who
are interested in distributing their novel algorithms.    Investigating languages
to describe algorithms and their interfaces benefit the component-based system
development, as well as describe Application Programming Interfaces in general.<p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

We have selected a set of algorithms that perform 2D part pose estimation.  The
set that was selected demonstrates a wide range of variety in capabilities and
interfaces.   We are concurrently investigating methodologies for describing the
algorithms.   Among the methods being evaluated are formal languages, such as Z
(Zed). We have begun collaboration with Real-Time Innovations, a vendor of the
real-time control design system Control Shell.   Their user community will be the
target audience for the first set of specifications.   The chosen algorithms will
be readily applicable to an inspection testbed being developed by NIST under
other complementary projects.<P>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Industry needs open system architecture standards for cost effective,
robust, sensory interactive intelligent mobile systems. Subsystems will:
<UL>
<LI>recognize objects, including obstacles and landmarks
<LI>accurately map the environment for navigation
<LI>detect and react to unexpected objects
<LI>locate objects for manipulation and handling tasks
<LI>compare object scenes for security and surveillance
<LI>operate safely and robustly in unstructured environments
</UL>

Open systems architecture standards will promote efficient integration of these
subsystems and simplify future expansion when adding third party components.
Proprietary interfaces, on the other hand, lead to limited system
functionality, long system development time, and high cost.  The need is for
standard interfaces allowing integration of commercially available
plug-and-play systems.<p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Test and validate open-systems architecture for intelligent mobile
robots
<LI>Work with industry to develop and improve sensor-based controllers
for intelligent mobile systems
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/HMMWV1.gif">
Two mobility testbeds are being developed. <p>

The first, an indoor testbed, consists of a battery-powered mobile platform,
advanced sensors, and the Real-time Control System (RCS) open architecture
controller. The on-board sensors include a rangefinder, cameras under computer
pan/tilt control, and inertial sensors (e.g., gyroscopes, accelerometers).
Vision processing is accomplished using real-time image processing computers.
The indoor testbed focus is on physical security and surveillance in industrial
facilities such as warehouses and office buildings.<p>

The second, an outdoor testbed, consists of a High Mobility Multipurpose
Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) 4-wheel drive Army vehicle equipped with control
actuators on the steering, brake, throttle, etc., advanced sensors, and an RCS
control system.  This vehicle is capable of both highway driving and off-road
driving over rough terrain.  Advanced sensors on the vehicle include cameras, a
laser range imaging camera (LADAR), an inertial navigation system, and a Global
Positioning System (GPS) satellite-based navigation system. The vehicle can be
operated remotely by a human operator via teleoperation or autonomously via
machine vision systems.<p>

The control system for both indoor and outdoor mobility testbeds is the
Real-time Control System (RCS), an open system reference architecture. RCS
provides real-time processing of sensor data for feedback control, reactive
planning for adapting to the changing environment and task demands, and
low-level servo control for steering and speed control.<p>
Vision is the primary sensor used on both testbeds. Dynamic image analysis
combined with attentional focus provides information about terrain and ground
surfaces, obstacles, and moving objects, as well as information about the
motion of the vehicle through the environment.<p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The adoption of open-systems architecture standards for mobility
applications will lead to better systems for users, more market opportunities
for component suppliers, and lower prices through increased competition.  Open
interface standards mean easier, faster integration of subsystems, and less
expensive customization of products. <p>

Emerging markets for intelligent mobile systems include: autonomous material
handling, operations in hazardous environments, security surveillance, advanced
motor vehicle control, and aids for the handicapped.<p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

An RCS control system has been installed on both testbeds to evaluate
interface standards.<p>

The indoor testbed currently navigates the laboratory, using its vision system
to avoid obstacles.  <p>

The outdoor testbed vehicle autonomously drives at highway speeds (55 mph)
using computer vision to detect the highway lane markers. <p>

Technical accomplishments include:<p>

<UL>
<LI>development and implementation of several image flow algorithms, both
real-time and non real-time
<LI>detecting obstacles using image flow from a single camera
<LI>image processing that extracts only those image features that are
relevant to the task at hand, resulting in efficient processing
<LI>maintaining lateral clearance from objects through camera gaze
control to actively determine the regions from which image data are obtained

This activity is an important part of the NIST System Integration for

full advantage of developing advanced technologies in computation and
communication. This project in particular benefits the coming "Data Highway"
National Information Infrastructure. The operator interface portion of the
program will enable users to access necessary information in the most efficient
manner. It combines advanced display technology with an understanding of human
factors issues and actual information needs of potential users.<p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

This is a multiyear program. Program planning has been done, and several
workshops and studies have provided preliminary direction.  The figure depicts a
graphical interface into the real-time database of a simulated gear-manufacturing
operation demonstrated in September 1994. This demonstration included 3D
(non-stereo) visualization of the factory facility and in-depth visualization of
workstation operations. Components visualized included milling machines, robots,
and materials-delivery systems. Textual, graphic, and numeric operating
information and schedules, command queues, inventories and similar data were
displayed. Subsequently, an advanced 3D immersion system was installed and the
simulation was ported to it. Currently, this testbed is being prepared for a
broader class of operations, including TGRIP-based applications. Simultaneously,
a Web-based virtual environment has been constructed which aims at providing
real-time text-based and near-real-time graphics-based hybrid interfaces to
remote operators with low-end equipment, over standard Internet connections.<p>

<H2>Enhanced Aerial Lift Control</H2>
<P><HR SIZE=5><P></CENTER>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Due to more stringent environmental regulations and the increased cost of waste
disposal, using conventional open air, dry, abrasive blasting processes in Navy
shipyards has been virtually eliminated. The Navy has been testing a prototype
high pressure water blast system in which the stripping media is recovered and
recycled. This minimizes both pollution and waste.  The prototype strip-recovery
equipment includes an articulated two-axis stage which moves a high pressure
water nozzle and a vacuum shroud to remove paint from the ship hull.  This
prototype stripping unit has been mounted in place of the original platform or
basket on a five-axis, commercial aerial lift.  In operation, the aerial lift is
used to position and hold the stripping unit stationary against the ship hull,
while the articulated stage moves the nozzle-recovery components back and forth
in a rastor motion, removing the paint.  Once the paint has been removed from the
area beneath the two-axis stage, an operator must reposition the strip-recovery
unit using the standard multiple-lever lift control system to coordinate the
joint motions of the aerial lift.<p>

Commercial aerial lifts, such as that used for this strip-recovery testing,
require the operator to independently control the motions of each of the
machine's joints.  This mode of control limits the speed with which the
strip-recovery unit can be repositioned.  Sensors or other operator aids also
facilitate a more accurate positioning of the strip-recovery unit.  In addition,
as this stripping technique and possibly other techniques are refined, a
continuous rather than intermittent motion of the aerial lift and strip-recovery
equipment may reduce removal time.<p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Develop and implement an Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC)
architecture-based controller for aerial lift.
<LI>Implement coordinated joint motion to provide teleoperated cartesian motion
of the strip recovery unit (aerial lift end-effector).
<LI>SIntegrate sensors on an existing strip-recovery unit to provide feedback for
surface-following operations and enhanced positioning and sequencing operations.
<LI>Test and demonstrate the aerial lift system at a shipyard with the
strip-recovery unit.
<LI>Work with the aerial lift manufacturer Snorkel, to develop and integrate
sensors and sensor-based control of other lift functions, such as surface
following and payload-based speed and work volume control.
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/PaintRemoval.gif">
Work that has been completed to date on the Enhanced Machine Controller project
is being leveraged in support of the aerial lift controller development.   The
EMC-based aerial lift controller is being implemented on a commercially available
and inexpensive PC-based computer.  Position sensors have been installed at each
of the aerial lift joints.  Multiple sensors are being installed at some joints
to compensate for backlash and instability.  Electrohydraulic proportional
control valves, which are common to this industry, are installed at each of the
aerial lift joints to provide the actuator interfaces to the controller.  An
industrial joystick provides the basic operator interface for teleoperation. 
Additional sensors and actuators are being integrated to improve the ability to
quickly and accurately position the system, as well as providing the basics for
other enhancements, such as surface-following capability. <p>

The aerial lift manufacturer, Snorkel, has provided an aerial lift for the
project. Snorkel provides expertise in mobile hydraulic systems and general
technical guidance toward the development of a reliable prototype paint stripping
system for the Navy.<p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The enhanced aerial lift will provide benefits to the Navy, as well as industrial
aerial lift users.  With the enhanced controller, the aerial lift will move in a
more intuitive fashion up/down, left/right, forward/back, and rotate relative to
the lift bucket or end-of-arm tooling (strip-recovery equipment.) The
strip-recovery unit will also be instrumented with sensors to aid the operator in
accurately positioning the unit against the ship hull while avoiding the risk of
damage due to collisions.  The goal is to produce a practical prototype for hull
stripping which could be essentially duplicated for widespread use in Navy
shipyards, depots, and other commercial facilities.<p>

We anticipate a a much broader market for this type of equipment, both in DoD and
private industry.    The EMC-based control system developed for the aerial lift
will also provide a platform for testing many varied sensor-based control
enhancements in other applications in which aerial lifts or other similar
equipment are used. These and other similar enhancements may be developed for
future incorporation into production aerial lifts.  Some of these enhancements
could include: coordinated motion, path programmability, surface following and
safety enhancements such as payload limits and actively constraining lift reach
in proportion to the load being carried.<p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

NIST and aerial lift manufacturer Snorkel entered into a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement (CRADA.) Under this agreement, Snorkel has provided NIST
with a model TBA-60 aerial lift, as well as operator training and support for the
required electro-proportional valve retrofit.  The EMC-based aerial lift control
system has been developed and tested extensively.  A basic 486 computer and
motion control board comprise the primary computer hardware.  Valve-to-computer
interface hardware has been implemented to transmit the necessary pulse-width
modulated signals to the electrohydraulic valves.  Sensors were installed at each
of the five aerial lift joints to provide position feedback.  A four-axis
joystick was implemented to provide a basic operator interface for teleoperation.
 Sonic sensors were installed on the end-of-arm basket to provide
basket-to-surface distance feedback.<p>

Teleoperated cartesian motion of the end-of-arm basket has been accomplished with
the enhanced control system.  A mode of operation in which a programmed surface
stand-off distance is maintained during teleoperation has been tested.  Extensive
aerial lift performance testing has been conducted.   In addition, a number of
valve compensation techniques have been tested to improve various performance
parameters of the lift, including response time, nonlinearity and temperature
affects.  Additionally, higher performance servo valves are being implemented to
test and compare the resulting lift performance with that of the existing valves.<p>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/RSTA2.gif">
Reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) are critical
components in most military missions. These are dangerous tasks for the soldiers
who carry them out. Often, appropriate information is not obtained due to limited
resources, or because soldiers are forced to perform RSTA while performing other
duties. This results in inefficiencies. The capability to perform autonomous RSTA
will greatly increase safety and efficiency of military missions.<p>

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is currently administering
the Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) Demo II program. The goals are to develop and
integrate the technologies required to achieve supervised autonomy of unmanned
ground vehicles. The ability to perform RSTA in an autonomous manner is an
important requirement of the system. <p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Develop and demonstrate an active vision system in support of the RSTA function
of the DARPA UGV Demo II program. The system will demonstrate RSTA from cameras
mounted on moving vehicles.<p>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="/graphics/brochure/RSTA.gif">
A testbed using the NIST High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) is
being established in which to develop and demonstrate the RSTA system. The
scenario is the following: While the vehicle is moving, a RSTA camera under
computer pan/tilt control will scan the terrain looking for moving targets (such
as tanks, trucks, and smaller vehicles). Once a target is detected, it will be
tracked through pan/tilt computer control. To achieve this, we will develop an
integrated system of software and hardware that can stabilize an image sequence
and identify and track an object whose motion is independent of the vehicle's
motion.<p>

NIST is working jointly with a team of universities including University of
Maryland, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Rochester. The University
of Maryland is developing the capabilities for digital image stabilization and
vision-based camera motion estimation. The University of Pennsylvania is
developing capabilities for camera pan/tilt/zoom control for tracking. The
University of Rochester is developing capabilities for moving target detection
and tracking. NIST is working on system integration, inertial sensor system
development, pan/tilt gaze control and target tracking.<p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Autonomous RSTA can greatly enhance the capabilities of military missions by
providing greater safety, accuracy, and force multiplication. Greater safety
results when RSTA is performed by an unmanned, rather than a manned, vehicle in
enemy territory. Accuracy of automatic RSTA technologies are continuously
improving. It will eventually surpass the accuracy of RSTA performed by humans.
Force multiplication results when fewer soldiers are required on the battlefield
because of computer-aided and automatic functions.<p>

The technology developed under this program will also provide benefits to other
application areas, including outdoor and indoor surveillance for security and
surveillance of highways for monitoring traffic flow.<p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

A testbed facility has been established containing a stand-alone, ruggedized VME
computing environment. The environment consists of a Transitions Research
Corporation (TRC) UniSight/BiSight camera head with pan/tilt/vergence, a Datacube
MV-200 real-time image processor for low-level image processing (image
acquisition, filtering, overlays) and a multi-processor system of three SPARC
computers for motion analysis and tracking. The unit also contains a Delta Tau
PMAC servo controller for high-performance control of the camera head.<p>

The ability to obtain video data from cameras on board the HMMWV vehicle with
inertial motion data stamped on each video frame has been developed. This is
necessary to perform experiments in image stabilization and image motion
extraction. Work is currently proceeding on developing a gaze control system for
the TRC head. <p>

The University of Rochester has developed the capability for real-time detection
of moving targets. The University of Maryland has developed the capability for
real-time image stabilization by feature tracking and derotation of camera
motion. These packages have been ported and demonstrated on the NIST testbed.<p>

<H2>Intelligent Control in Manufacturing</H2>
<P><HR SIZE=5><P></CENTER>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

A formal, consistent, factory-wide control architecture is needed because:
<UL>
<LI>The lack of a common system architecture limits integration and leads
to "islands" of automation.
<LI>Functionality is limited by the inability to integrate the components
of multiple developers as the result of proprietary    or non-standard
interfaces.
<LI>Minimal reusable software components lead to higher cost.
<LI>There are arbitrary differences in implementation techniques because
a common model is not followed.
<LI>No common development tools exist because of the differences among
various architectural approaches.
</UL>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Develop a NIST Reference Model Architecture for intelligent control
of manufacturing processes.
<LI>Demonstrate, validate and evaluate the Reference Model Architecture
through analysis and performance measurements of a simulated and prototype
implementation.
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>
<UL>
<LI>Evaluate current, applicable control architectures.
<LI>Document architecture requirements for intelligent control in
manufacturing to determine where existing approaches can be employed and where
further development is needed.
<LI>Develop a mechanism for formally documenting the architecture. Use it to
document the design of the reference model 	architecture.
<LI>Develop/select Computer Aided Software Engineering tools to support
implementations of the reference model architecture.
<LI>Work with industry to implement the architecture in simulation and in a
prototype facility.
<LI>Evaluate and refine the reference model architecture based on
performance measurements of the simulated and prototype system.
<LI>Work toward standardization of the reference model architecture and
various information interfaces.
</UL>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The reference model architecture will promote a higher level of integration and
the standardization of subsystem interfaces. Because the architecture will no
longer be a "moving target," the potential for software reuse is greater, due to
the probability of creating development tools that are useful across many
applications.<p>

The results will be cost savings in the development and implementation of
intelligent control systems for manufacturing.<p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

There exists no general theory or design procedure for sensory perception systems
that can build and maintain real-time world models capable of supporting
intelligent planning and sensory interactive control.  Lack of a general theory
of sensory perception and world modeling is a fundamental barrier to the
development and widespread use of intelligent control technology.  For example,
machine vision systems are limited in capability and unreliable in performance
except when operating in narrowly constrained problem domains.  Vision research
tends to focus on relatively simple problems, and  there exists no systematic
theory for fusion of data from multiple sources into a coherent robust model
capable of representing real world complexities. <p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Develop a  reference model architecture for perception including a sensory
perception and world modeling system that will support general purpose machine
vision.<p>

The system will incorporate color cameras with foveal and peripheral visual

systems.  It will be fully integrated with vestibular sensors, proprioceptive
sensors, and position measuring systems. The system will use image flow, and
support dynamic predictive modeling of camera and observed entity behavior at
multiple levels of abstraction.  It will perform correlation, differencing,
recursive filtering and state estimation, and compute statistics at multiple

Inexpensive, robust, machine vision would have enormous economic benefits for
manufacturing, construction, environmental restoration, and exploration of the
sea floor and planetary surfaces, as well as for intelligent vehicles and highway
systems, and military applications of undersea, land, and air vehicles and
weapons systems.  The potential world market for intelligent control systems with
robust inexpensive machine vision is many billions of dollars per year.<p>

The NIST Real-time Control System (RCS) is a reference model architecture and
does not specify implementation details. This holds true for the software
structure of the control application, as well as the underlying computing
platform. RCS application developers have focused on the structure of their RCS
software and deferred the application development. Furthermore, much of the
development time has been spent interfacing with the operating system and
hardware devices. Programmers need a common set of interfaces to RCS functions
which they can learn only once. Code using these common interfaces can be ported
from one application to another.<p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Reduce the effort required to develop real-time control systems by providing
portable and reusable software for common functions.
<LI>Relieve control application developers from the burden of computing-
platform configuration by establishing an experienced support team.
<LI>Make NIST's Real-time Control System available to others in a documented
electronic format.
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

To make technology developed in RCS applications available to others, a
foundation for portability has been laid. The basis for this foundation is a set
of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to common functions used by RCS
programmers. These include generic functions, such as operating system calls;
functions for communicating data between controller components; and RCS-specific
functions for sensory processing, task decomposition, world modeling, and the
operator interface.<p>

A de facto set of supported hardware and software has been established to
minimize the effort required to support the many RCS applications. The APIs have
been ported to this set. As new hardware and software technology becomes
available, the set will be extended.<p>

Applications have been selected to use the APIs which were initially developed
for the purpose of validating the interfaces. Additionally, the software
technology developed in each application will be archived so that it may be used
in subsequent controllers.<p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<B>Reduction in programming effort</B>
<UL>
<LI>One familiar programming interface is available for a variety of different
platforms.
<LI>Algorithms developed in one application can be incorporated by other
controllers.
<LI>A stable base of libraries can evolve to become more robust.
</UL>

<B>System integration is minimized</B>
<UL>
<LI>Controllers can benefit from advancements in computer technology without
incompatibility worries.
<LI>Expertise in technical support group need not be duplicated in each
controller project.
</UL>

<B>Broader application of RCS</B>
<UL>
<LI>Single uniform RCS implementation and associated documentation may be
formally distributed.
</UL>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

An API to operating system functions has been written in C++, and ported to the
SunOS, LynxOS, VxWorks, Irix, DOS, and Windows operating systems. These functions
include semaphores, shared memory, timers, and tasking.<p>

A C++ API for communication functions which provides a uniform interface to a
variety of communication protocols has been written. Support with local access or
via networks is available for single-processor shared memory and backplane global
memory. Neutral data representation is available so that machines with different
internal representations of numbers may share data.<p>

A C++ template for an RCS control node in the hierarchy has been written. It is
being validated in several applications: the Enhanced Machine Controller, the
Next Generation Inspection System, the Robocrane, the Mobility Testbed, and the
Hexapod.<p>

A World-Wide Web site has been created to make the C++ API documentation more
easily available.

(SA-ALC) is responsible for maintenance on the C-5 airframe, including such
tasks as paint stripping and repainting, part cleaning, surface finishing of
panels, skin repair of engine cowls, and sealing and de-sealing of fuel tanks.
Telerobotics has been identified as a key enabling technology for improving the
productivity of a wide range of aircraft maintenance tasks. Conventional
robotic technology is not particularly appropriate for these aircraft
maintenance tasks for several reasons. For example, the batch sizes are small,
and there are typically no Computer Aided Design (CAD) files for the parts to
be repaired. A manipulator under telerobotic control augments the cognitive
skills of the human operator with the precision and consistent performance of a
machine. However, an impediment to the widespread implementation and use of
telerobotic technology for depot maintenance tasks has been the lack of a
well-defined, modular software architecture and interfaces to facilitate the
integration of system components and to provide a consistent operator
interface. The Unified Telerobotics Architecture Project has sought to fill
this void.<p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

To study the implementation of telerobotic surface and edge finishing
for aircraft depot tasks, based on the Unified Telerobotic Architecture Project
(UTAP) architecture and interfaces.<p>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

To improve the efficiency of implementing telerobotic applications, the
San Antonio Air Logistics Center (SA-ALC) sponsored a preliminary study
(performed by JPL) to develop a proposal for a generic telerobotic control
system architecture (UTAP). During FY 94, Advanced Cybernetics Group, Inc.
(ACG), JPL, and Trellis joined NIST in defining the interfaces for the
architecture. The next step is to validate these UTAP interfaces for one or
more depot maintenance applications. In this project, aircraft surface and edge
finishing applications will be investigated to evaluate the UTAP architecture
and interfaces, and to bring them closer to implementation at SA-ALC and
potentially other ALC's and commercial aircraft maintenance facilities. Two
related applications have been selected to study the usefulness of the UTAP
architecture and interfaces. These are edge finishing and surface finishing.
NIST will investigate the application of UTAP specifications to edge finishing
(deburring) by following the UTAP arrangement of software modules and message
definitions in developing the Advanced Deburring and Chamfering System (ADACS).
Since NIST does not have significant expertise in robotic surface finishing, a
subcontractor will be funded to develop a surface finishing demonstration built
around a UTAP compliant controller. Telerobotics experts at JPL will assist
NIST in evaluating the design and final implementation of the operator
interface and other aspects of the demonstration system built by the
subcontractor. <p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The finishing applications performed at SA-ALC currently require the
operator to use hand and power tools to smooth repaired areas. Airborne dust
and other particles are prevalent in the work environment, and the tasks
require highly repetitive motions. Direct exposure to noise and vibration of
finishing equipment is also a problem. The use of telerobotic technology for
surface finishing applications will improve working conditions for the
maintenance staff and reduce the frequency of repetitive motion injuries. In
addition, a greater degree of process control will improve the consistency of
the finish work.<p>

The UTAP architecture and interfaces will lower the implementation cost of
telerobotic applications by providing a common framework for software
development. The goal is to be able to launch most new applications by
assembling pre-packaged components, rather than by starting from scratch each
time. The use of a modular software architecture will allow incremental
development of programming software, sensing technologies, and manipulator
control capabilities. Operator training requirements will be minimized, as a
result of having a consistent Operator Interface across applications. In
addition to their use at SA-ALC, the UTAP architecture and interfaces have the
potential for application at other Air Logistics Centers and commercial
maitenance depots.<p>

This project will serve to further develop and refine the architecture by
investigating implementations of two closely-related finishing applications.
Progress toward commercialization of the architecture will be made by
contracting with a systems integration house to develop a prototype surface
finishing demonstration.<p>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

About 20 medium size U.S. companies are developing machine vision
technology in support of industry, and NIST is conducting basic research that
these companies cannot support on their own. NIST research in this area can
help balance the strong national programs being supported abroad. <p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Robust object tracking under non-ideal conditions
<LI>Ability to model and track a wide variety of objects
<LI>Methods for determining the characteristics that best distinguish an
object from the background
<LI>Strategies for differentiating physically distinct objects
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC="/graphics/brochure/TRICLOPS.gif">
Machine vision is beginning to play a significant role in automated
assembly and inspection. The utility of machine vision systems would be
enhanced greatly if the cameras could be moved under computer control to look
at different areas of interest. We are developing controllable camera motion to
obtain better and more efficient visual sensing.<p>

In most industrial situations there is a great deal of knowledge about the
appearance of the scene. This knowledge can be used to enhance visual sensing
performance using what is called "model-based vision." In this approach, visual
processing is guided by models which provide "expectations" of what the cameras
are seeing. In our research we seek to develop model-based techniques to guide
all levels of processing. <p>

We have designed and built The Real-time, Intelligently-ControLled Optical
Positioning System (TRICLOPS), a new trinocular robot head. TRICLOPS combines
exceptional dynamic performance with concurrent multiresolutional sensing
capability. Using three microminiature video cameras, TRICLOPS simultaneously
provides both a wide angle, low resolution view of the world to give "the big
picture," and two higher resolution views for obtaining detailed stereo vision
information. The wide-angle camera also provides color image information, which
can serve as an important cue for directing attention. Human-like in both
dynamic performance and range of motion of its 4 axes, TRICLOPS   directs the
cameras to anywhere within its range in just over half a second.<p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

As this technology further matures, it will have industrial applications
including:
<UL>
<LI>Visual Inspection - With its high speed, TRICLOPS can look at many
different areas of large parts (such as aircraft or ship panels) in a short
amount of time. Moving parts can be followed and observed. Moreover, the
model-based techniques 	are well suited to detection of faults and anomalies
in parts.  Visual inspection techniques will enhance manufacturing quality
control and reduce costs.
<LI>Teleoperated/Autonomous Assembly and Construction - Visual
tracking capabilities can be used to establish pre-contact alignment of parts
during assembly. Machine vision can alleviate dependence on fixturing and jigs
to align parts. For teleoperated assembly and construction, TRICLOPS can be
used to provide visual sensing.
</UL>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Experimentation with TRICLOPS has demonstrated that the system can:<p>
<UL>
<LI>Perform motions with peak velocity and acceleration comparable to
human capabilities.
<LI>Determine the 3-D position of a spherical target to within about
0.0035 rad (0.2&#176;) in azimuth and elevation, and about 1% to 2% in
range.
<LI>Bring objects into view which are within an envelope of 5.42 rad
(310&#176;) in azimuth and 2.05 rad (117&#176;) in elevation.
</UL>

Visual tracking algorithms have been developed to:<p>
<UL>
<LI>Servo TRICLOPS on a moving target in a simple scene at speeds
exceeding human capability.
<LI>Track targets in the presence of partial occlusions, and in front of
cluttered and potentially ambiguous backgrounds.
<LI>Track a target moving with a full 6 degrees of positional freedom.
Tracking with a stereo pair of cameras has been demonstrated as various object
features move in and out of view as the object rotates with respect to the
camera system.
<LI>Track lane markers on roads and highways, providing the perception
required to autonomously steer a computer controlled vehicle. This algorithm
has been used to drive the NIST HMMWV vehicle under computer control at speeds
of up to 80 km/h on a variety of roads and in the presence of non-ideal
lighting conditions including rain, shadowing, and nighttime driving with
headlights.
<LI>Visually track a target mounted on the back of a moving "lead
vehicle" from the vantage of a pursuing "chase vehicle."  This algorithm has
been used for autonomous convoy driving where a chase vehicle, the NIST
HMMWV, is driven such that it follows the path of a lead vehicle.

<H2>Enabling Intelligent Control</H2>
<P><HR SIZE=5><P></CENTER>

<H3>Need</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

In IEEE's Spectrum Magazine (January 1995), an article summarizing key
events in industrial electronics in 1994 states, "Calls for greater
architectural commonality came from users of control systems, among others."
NIST's long-term research on robotics and automation has led to a unifying
architecture for controller design called the Real-time Control System (RCS)
reference architecture.  RCS contains analysis, design, and implementation
techniques for developing complex intelligent control systems.  We believe that
now is the time when a comprehensive architecture like RCS is needed, and a
software development tool based on RCS is required to transfer this technology
to the control system community.<p>

<H3>Goals</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

<UL>
<LI>Develop specification for and prototype of a graphical user interface
tool that automates the development of large-scale control system designs
according to the RCS reference architecture and design method
<LI>Through Cooperative Research and Development Agreements and other
appropriate contractual vehicles, work with existing software vendors to
develop an environment based on the RCS tool specification
<LI>Develop a working RCS design methodology specification document that
will serve as the basis for creating the tool specification and prototype
</UL>

<H3>Approach</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The RCS Computer-Aided Control System Engineering (CACSE) Tool (RCT)
will be a full development environment for RCS.  The RCT will have both code
development and debug portions.  Because it will consist of separable
components, the tool could conceivably be developed and tested in separate
stages.  The overall goal is to automate as much of the process of large-scale
control system development as possible, and to create a tool that would allow
the developer to focus on the application alone.  The choice of a graphical
user interface (GUI) tool is evident, since software code development is
increasingly being done this way.<p>

Tools generally support methodologies either explicitly or implicitly.
Consequently, it is unlikely that any commercial tool will be fully
satisfactory for RCS development. We argue the need to have a set of precise
specifications and a prototype tool developed to those specifications.
However, it is possible that a prototype containing a commercial product as the
cornerstone might be sufficient to validate and test the RCT specification.
Furthermore, through a variety of contractual vehicles (e.g., Cooperative
Research and Development Agreements), we hope to interest software tool vendors
in developing a prototype RCT based on our specifications. <p>

<H3>Benefits</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

Capturing the RCS methodology within a CACSE framework will formalize a
valuable analysis, design, and implementation paradigm for intelligent control
systems.  Control systems built with this approach would have improved quality
and reduced cost of development and thereby maintain and increase the
competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing.<p>

<H3>Progress</H3>
<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

We have developed a precise set of RCS specifications that can be used
by design engineers to develop complex intelligent control systems using the
RCS paradigm.  These specifications will form the basis for the RCT.  We have
also analyzed and will continue to investigate a wide variety of commercially
available tools in order to 1) see if any of these tools would allow control
system development according to the RCS approach, 2) learn, through the
features of each tool, what the control systems developers require in such
tools, and 3) develop a feature list for the potential development of a tool
like that proposed under this project. <p>

We believe--and industry agrees--that improved measurement technology and
interface standards for data exchange can greatly expand the range of
applications where machines can economically perform reliable welds. In a 1991
study, The Construction Industry Institute identified welding as one of the top
three needs (out of fifty) for automation in construction. This high ranking was
based on issues such as safety, productivity, and worker utilization. Yet, due to
lack of interface standards, it is often difficult for users to integrate
commercial computerized components of welding design, planning, and automation
systems.   The American Welding Society formed a new committee (A9) in 1993 to
address this problem.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50% ALIGN=left><P>

The Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) has over 15 years of experience in
developing and applying Real-Time Control Systems (RCS). The technology developed
for the Advanced Deburring and Chamfering System and Composites Workstation for
the Navy is particularly valuable to the development of an intelligent control
system for arc welding manufacturing applications. Much of the work in off-line
programming for robotic trajectory planning and execution and interactive sensor
development is directly applicable to the welding initiative. We have begun
renovation of an existing lab and retrofit of a controller to a large industrial
robot.<p>

The MRD has established itself as a leading research laboratory in developing
diagnostics for the arc welding process. It has developed and demonstrated
methods for autonomous control of the process using practical cost effective
computer systems.   Welding technology was further advanced during a major
three-year programmable arc welding program with the U.S. Navy. <p>

Other significant NIST accomplishments include:<p>

<UL>
<LI>General Motors is now using NIST arc sensing technology in the production of
catalytic converters.
<LI>The Materials Reliability Division was awarded U.S. Patent 5,221,825 in 1993
for the general sensing strategy and several more patent applications have been
filed.
<LI>The Technology Reinvestment Program plans to fund a joint   program (with
Cybo Robots and other automation vendors) to incorporate NIST's present sensing
technology in an advanced welding robot system for shipbuilding.
<LI>ISD has consulted with an experienced commercial partner (Deneb Robotics)
who would like to participate in developing an advanced intelligent control
system for arc welding equipment. They have been working on a simulation
environment product for the arc welding industry and have collaborated with
partners in the automotive industry, heavy construction equipment industry and
others.
<LI>An industry needs workshop was held in August 1995 bringing together a group

<H3>What is the Enhanced Machine Controller?</H3>
The Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC) program is a NIST effort to develop and validate a specification for interfaces to open architecture controllers. This specification is being developed jointly with the Department of Energy <A HREF="http://cewww.eng.ornl.gov/team/home.html">Technologies Enabling Agile Manufacturing</A> (TEAM) program. The specification is formally defined in the C++ language, and consists of C++ header files forming an Application Programming Interface (API) suitable for programmers. These header files are referred to as the <A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/info/team/">TEAM APIs</A>.
<P>
An <A HREF="consort.html"> EMC Consortium</A> has been established, focused on developing and validating the TEAM APIs in real-world applications. Consortium members include representatives from the end-user, controls provider, and technology provider communities. Membership responsibilities include reviewing the interface specification, recommending applications that can be used to test open architecture controller concepts. Members may also become involved in actual controller installations. The consortium will be active from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 1998. There is no cost for participation.
<P>
Several controllers have been installed on <A HREF="testbeds.html">testbeds</A> for the purpose of validating that the APIs work in real-world application. A second purpose for these testbeds is to further the NIST <A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/rcslib/">Real-time Control System</A> methodology. In these testbeds, controllers conforming to the TEAM APIs have been built which also have been developed following the RCS methodology.
<H3>What does "Open Architecture" mean?</H3>
There has been considerable debate on what precisely "open architecture" means, particularly with respect to machine controllers. Openness is often described in terms of the "-ilities": modularity, portability, interoperability, scaleability, and extensibility (see the <A HREF="glossary.html">Glossary</A>). The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines the following terms [<A HREF="references.html#REF1">1</A>]:
<UL>
<LI><b>Open system</b>: a system that implements sufficient open specifications or standards for interfaces, services, and supporting formats to enable properly engineered application software<br>
-- to be ported with minimal changes across a wide range of systems from one or more suppliers;<br>
-- to interoperate with other applications on local and remote systems;<br>
-- to interact with people in a style that facilitates user portability.
<LI><b>Open system API</b>: a combination of standards-based interfaces specifying a complete interface between an application program and the underlying application platform
<LI><b>Open system environment</b>: a comprehensive set of interfaces, services, and supporting formats, plus user aspects for interoperability or for portability of applications, data, or people, as specified by information technology standards and profiles.
</UL>
The Next Generation Controller (NGC) Specifications for an Open System Architecture Standard (SOSAS) [<A HREF="references.html#REF2">2</A>] augments this with a definition of
<UL>
<LI><b>Open system architecture</b>: a specification of the capabilities or services that provides the interconnection structure and defines the interface between interoperating components, thus allowing applications to be integrated into a system with a consistent style of interaction.
</UL>
The TEAM APIs are an open system API for machine controllers, including machine tools, robots, and coordinate measuring machines. The TEAM APIs, together with a collection of services sometimes called the <i>infrastructure</i> or <i>common execution environment</i>, form an open system environment for machine control. The purpose of the EMC program is to develop and validate this open system environment, based on real-world implementations in shop floor environments, together with a consortium of users, vendors, and technology providers.

<H2>Senior Design Project</H2>
The purpose of our project was to design an energy efficiency
monitoring system for an electric minibus.  The monitoring system
measures information about the condition of the bus and uses that
information to estimate the energy efficiency of the bus.  Some of
the information used by the monitoring system is the Battery Voltage,
the Battery Current, the Vehicle Speed, and Motor Temperature.  <P>

My part of the project was broken down into two parts: design a new
speedometer and help developing the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for
the monitoring system.  The speedometer available on the bus did not
perform up to the standards that we needed for our monitoring system.
It provided an output signal that was unreadable below approximately 5
mph (we needed about 1 mph).  Also the output signal was analog, which
had to be converted to a digital signal before it could be read
by our computer system.  Our computer system uses two frequency
counter boards for digital signals that could read up to 2 MHz.  <P>

The GUI was developed as a stand-alone application for our Macintosh
IIx computer.  We found that it was necessary to program the GUI from
scratch instead of using a commercial development package, like
Labview, because these packages could not access enough of the counter
boards functions.  Two graphical displays were developed: one for the
bus driver and one for the computer operator.  The driver's GUI
displayed less detailed information about the bus, but in a more
graphical way.  It uses bars that move up and down to display
information about the voltage of all four battery packs combined, the
current flowing through the battery packs, the estimated charge remaining
in all four battery packs combined, and the motor temperature.  Other
information was also displayed as well: the speed of the bus, the time
of day, the elapsed time since the monitoring system was started, the
miles traveled, and the estimated miles remaining on the charge.  The
operator's display included all of the same information as the
driver's dislay, but in a more detailed manor.  It displayed the
voltage of each battery pack separately and up to four temperature's
around the bus, along with all of the other information.<P>

<H2>Robotics Project</H2>
One of my requirements for Robotics was to design, build, and control
a robotic arm.  The only restriction we had was that the robot had
to have at least 2 degrees of freedom.  Our robot was designed to play
chess against a human opponent.  The user plays chess against a 
computer, while the robot moves all of the pieces on the chess board.<P>

By the time the project was finished, we were able to achieve closed
loop control of the robotic arm.  Due to some technical difficulties,
we were not able to impliment a path planning routine.  We were also
not able to impliment the chess playing routine.  The code was
available, but the time needed to include this into our control
software was not available. <P>

<LI><I>1991</I> - Publication of "An Outline for a Theory of Intelligence."<P>
<LI><I>1986</I> - The development of NBS/NASA Standard Reference Model for Telerobot Control System Architecture (NASREM).  NASREM has been used by NASA and NASA contractors, plus a number of companies and university laboratories throughout the world for designing telerobotic systems.<P>
<LI><I>1981</I> - The development of a theory of hierarchical control for robots and intelligent machines, and the design of the control system architecture for the Automated Manufacturing Research Facility (AMRF) at the National Bureau of Standards.  The AMRF control system architecture has been adopted in whole or in part by numerous industrial designers of automated manufacturing facilities, as well as by researchers in government, industry, and academia.  This hierarchical control system development was recognized by the Robot Industries Association with the Joseph F. Engelberger Award, presented at the 1984 International Symposium for Industrial Robots by the King of Sweden.<P>
<LI><I>1975</I> - The invention of a Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC), which won the Department of Commerce Silver Medal and an Industrial Research IR-100 award.  CMAC has become well known by students and researchers in adaptive learning-generalizing mechanisms, and is the subject of neural network studies in a number of laboratories in several countries.<P>
<LI><I>1971</I> - The development of a theory of cerebellar function, which together with complementary work by David Marr, has become known as the Marr-Albus theory of the cerebellum.  This theory is currently one of the leading hypotheses in the neurosciences, and the basis of experimental activity by leading cerebellar neurophysiologists throughout the world.<P>
<LI><I>1963</I> - The invention of a digital solar aspect sensor, which was subsequently used on more than twenty NASA spacecraft, seven of which were on display in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum for ten years.  This work was honored by a NASA invention award and a National Space Club Fellowship.

<H2><A HREF="http://www.nas.edu/rap/lab/NIST/">NIST Postdoctoral Research Opportunities</A></H2>

<P> <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/"> NIST</A> is one of 35 US Federal
Labs that participate in the <A HREF="http://www.nas.edu/rap/"> NRC
Research Associateship Program</A> administered by the <A
HREF="http://www.nas.edu/"> National Research Council</A>.  A
candidate proposes a research project to be conducted in conjunction
with a NIST research advisor in one of over 600 research opportunity
areas.  The NRC convenes a panel of experts that rate the applicants;
final selections are made by NIST.  <STRONG>U.S. citizenship is
required</STRONG> for these positions.  An associate is a regular
employee of the U.S. Government with a temporary appointment of 
up to two-years.  The doctorate must have been held less than 5 years
at the time of application.  </P>

<P> <STRONG>The application deadline is January 15th of each year</STRONG>;
awards are made in April for tenures to begin after July 1st. </P>

<P> At NIST, historically more than 30% of postdoc associates are
retained on the regular staff (though this rate has declined to around
10% in recent years).  Also, in order to compete with industrial
research laboratories and to free the researcher from ``bankrupt
postdoc'' worries, <STRONG>the positions pay rather well</STRONG>:
$45.5K salary plus full government benefits and relocation expenses 
and $5.5K professional funds (for travel, books, <I>etc.</I>).
Because of these attractive features, the competition is stiff.
<STRONG>In 1995 NIST funded 35 of 208 applicants.</STRONG>  </P>

<P> <STRONG>Don't let this discourage you from trying.</STRONG> The
paperwork is not overwhelming, and the payoff is a good position doing
research which you proposed with a chance of remaining at NIST on the
regular staff.  The chances that you will find someone here in your
general area of interest is fairly good, since work is performed here
in computer science, electrical engineering, manufacturing
engineering, applied math, chemistry, physics, materials science,
building and fire research, geology....</P>

projects are available. 

<H4>ISD's Perception Systems Group</H4>

<P> For instance, in our lab vision and sensor integration are focused
on <STRONG>autonomous robot mobility</STRONG> and <STRONG>visual gaze
control</STRONG>.  The aim is to provide local path planning, obstacle
avoidance, road and boundary following, and detection and pursuit of
moving targets.  We employ real time active vision, gaze control, and
foveal-peripheral vision with very wide FOV cameras (eg, 115 deg) as
well as more conventional lenses.  Motion vision is of particular
interest.  We will also be integrating and registering CCD and range
cameras on our HMMWV testbed.  </P>

<P> In another project, inspecting discrete manufactured parts,
<STRONG>model-based object recognition and registration</STRONG>
techniques are sought to register camera images with part models, in
order to direct contact devices to efficiently inspect parts with high
accuracy. </P>

<h1> Man Pages</h1>
For the standard UNIX manpages you will probably prefer to use the 
<A HREF="http://wsinwp01.win.tue.nl:1234/cgi-bin/man2html">man2html</A>
converter  written by
<A HREF="http://www.win.tue.nl/~rcb5/">Richard Verhoeven</A> which provides
true HTML formatting of the man pages. However some of the man pages on
the <A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov">ISD</A> network are formatted such that man2html does not work, so this 
text only server can be used.

<TITLE>Ted Camus's cover letter.</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR=CCDDFF>

<H3>
Dr. Ted Camus             <br>
NIST                      <br>
MET220 B124               <br>
Gaithersburg, MD 20899    <br>
301-975-4080 lab          <br>
301-975-3953 office       <br>
</H3>

My main interests are in the implementation and optimization of real-time
computer vision systems, image and video processing, virtual reality, 3-D
computer graphics, and high-performance computer architecture.
My current work represents the state-of-the-art in the field of motion
vision for robotics; recent publications confirm that this author's
algorithms are the fastest available, and are in fact the only ones capable
of running at video rates on standard computing hardware, often running
faster on an ordinary workstation than competing algorithms do on massively
parallel computers (publications are available on request).<P>

Real-time performance is achieved by designing algorithms which have very
low computational complexity and which are well suited to modern RISC
computer architectures.   This approach has resulted in a suite of real-time
image capture, display, and processing programs which are currently in heavy
use by my coworkers. <P>

My insistence on running my algorithms on standard, commonly available
workstations instead of specialized image processors rapidly speeds up
development and deployment of actual working systems.  The ability to
greatly simplify complex systems by reducing communications and interactions
between processes has been conclusively demonstrated on recent projects,
persuading colleagues to adopt similar philosophies. <P>

Advances in computational power and the use of specialized ASIC's have
reached the point where 3-D computer vision and 3-D computer graphics may
interact in realtime.  As a result it is now appropriate to consider
merging these two fields.  In particular, since 3-D environments can now be
modeled fairly cheaply, and somewhat realisticly, it is now possible to 1)
use computer vision to add realism to 3-D environment interaction, and/or
2) use synthetic environments to assist development of computer vision
algorithms.<P>

Thank you for your attention,<br>
Ted Camus<P>

<H2> Interests </H2>

Ted Camus's research interests lie primarily in <B>robust, real-time
optical flow</B> (or motion detection in images).  Ted feels that robotic
vision has three essential requirements: 1) <B>robustness</B>, 2)
<B>speed</B>, and 3) <B>accuracy</B>.

An algorithm which is not <B>robust</B> will by definition not be able to
handle a wide variety of inputs, deal effectively with noise, or be able to
function in uncertain environments; all of these properties are essential
for practical real-world robotic vision.  An algorithm which does not run
in <B>real-time</B> may be of considerable theoretical interest, but cannot
be used in a reactive system, and therefore is confined to the off-line
analysis of images.  It is particularly advantageous (but notoriously
difficult) to get an computer vision algorithm to run in <A
HREF="#CAMP95">real-time on standard computing hardware</A>, such as a
scientific workstation or high-end PC, due to the tremendous flexibility
and portability of such an implementation.  Finally, an algorithm must
return <B>accurate</B> results, but only <I>as appropriately defined for a
given task</I>.  This latter requirement allows us some flexibility.  In
particular, one can use <I>task-specific</I> algorithms where appropriate.
For example, if one is using optical flow to calculate
structure-from-motion, very accurate optical flow measurements are
generally required.  However, if one is using optical flow for obstacle
avoidance, some accuracy may be sacrificed in return for robustness and
real-time performance.  <P>

A significant example of a <I>task-specific</I> application of optical flow
is collision-detection, or more specifically time-to-contact.  (The
pessimistic term "time-to-collision" is also sometimes used.  I much prefer
Prof. Varju's (U. Tuebingen) suggestion of "time-to-touch"!)  In his <A
HREF="#thesis">thesis work</A> at Brown Ted demonstrated that under certain
conditions it was possible to calculate time-to-contact to sub-frame
accuracy using only quantized optical flow.  In fact some <A
HREF="#NISTIR_5609">continued experiments</A> at NIST demonstrated that this
could be done using as few as <I>eight</I> velocity direction
quantizations and only <I>one</I> velocity magnitude!  Current research 
involves the development of collision-detection algorithms that do not have 
some of the restrictions imposed by the previous approaches. <P>

To facilitate his research, Ted has developed a number of programs which
display the results of optical flow in real-time (as shown in the MPEG
animations below).  This makes development and testing much easier than it
would be otherwise by providing instant feedback concerning the quality of
the algorithms under development.  Naturally, the utility of such programs
would be greatly reduced if the optical flow algorithm itself did not run
in real-time. <P>

<H3>Current work:</H3>

Ted's main project as a NRC postdoc at NIST was the incorporation of his
real-time optical flow algorithm into the obstacle-avoidance system already
in place in the Perception Systems group.  This required extending his
algorithm to produce optical flow vectors whose components were real-valued
rather than quantized.  Using a clever interpolation scheme this was done
while only halving the frame rate.  Given the quantized algorithm's high
performance the new algorithm still ran sufficiently fast for real-time
robotic navigation (at up to 17 Hz using 32x64 images).  The substitution
of Ted's optical flow algorithm in place of the PIPE algorithm allowed the
entire obstacle avoidance system to run in real-time on a single UNIX
workstation using a single image stream.  The substitution of simple, fast
filters further reduced system complexity and simplified analysis.
Functional improvements over the previous system include greatly extending
the visual range of the system due to the more robust correlation-based
flow, the use of a single percept (divergence) to control both steering and
collision behavior, and adding the notion of goal-directed behavior in
addition to general obstacle avoidance. <P>

work.  Some <A HREF="#MPEG's">MPEG's</A> demonstrating the new
obstacle-avoidance system may be downloaded to see the new system in

<LI><B>"Obstacle Avoidance" sequence as described in the ICPR 1996 paper. </B>
<P>

Here is a GIF of a <A HREF= "NIST-OBSAVOID.html"><B>sample frame</B></A> of the
MPEG animation described below.
<P>
The upper left quarter of each frame is the original 256x512 pixel image,
taken from a 115 degree wide-angle lens, subsampled to 128x256 pixels.  (In
the sample frame you can see the back of the chair in the lower left
corner.  This represents the closest obstacle.)  The upper right quarter
shows the optical flow "needle" plot calculated from a 32x64 subsampled
version of the original image, with the needle diagram itself subsampled to
16x32 for clarity (here is the <A HREF= "NIST-OBSAVOID-full.html">
<B>full-res 32x64 "needle" plot</B></A> for the sample frame).
<P>
The lower right quarter of each frame shows a time-space plot of the 1-D
divergence estimates, median-filtered in space (11x17 pixel window) but not
in time.  In these plots brighter areas indicate higher divergence and thus
closer objects (each individual plot is automatically contrast-adjusted for
better clarity).  In these plots time moves upward; thus, the 1-D
divergence vector for the current frame is found at the top of the
subimage.  The lower left quarter of each frame shows the same divergence
plot but median filtered in time (11 frames) as well as in space (11
pixels).  The second filtered divergence estimate is used at each frame to
control the robot's steering.  (In the sample frame the divergence for the
chair shows clearly.  The robot is about to make a right turn due to the
chair's proximity.)  Because of the temporal median's width, the filtered
divergence information has a latency of 5 frames or about 1 second.  This
effect is offset however by the ability of the system to sense objects at a
range of up to several meters in advance.

pixel to 31 pixels.  <P>

The right field shows the result of dividing each radius from the FOE by
the averaged motion measurement for each given radius (i.e., the average of
each vertical column in the left field), plotted as the computed
time-to-contact vs. radius from the FOE.  Valid measurements are those
between the lower threshold (shown by a vertical line from below) and the
upper threshold (shown by the vertical line from above).  The dotted line
is the initial geometric average of all the valid measurements, and the
solid line is the final maximum-likelihood estimate (these are often
indistinguishable).  The Y-axis ranges from 0 frames up to 255 frames.  The

ABSTRACT: <br>
 
A real-time robot vision system is described which uses only the divergence
of the optical flow field for both steering control and collision
detection. The robot has wandered about the lab at 20 cm/s for as long as
26 minutes without collision. The entire system is implemented on a single
ordinary UNIX workstation without the benefit of real-time operating system
support. Dense optical flow data are calculated in real-time across the
entire wide-angle image. The divergence of this optical flow field is
calculated everywhere and used to control steering and collision behavior.
Divergence alone has proven sufficient for steering past objects and
detecting imminent collision. The major contribution is the demonstration
of a simple, robust, minimal system that uses flow-derived measures to
control steering and speed to avoid collision in real time for extended
periods.  Such a system can be embedded in a general, multi-level 
perception/control system. <P>

<HR>

<P>
<B>Background: </B> <br>

<P> Ted Camus received his B.S. (with honors) in Computer Science in 3
years from <A HREF= "http://www.cs.rpi.edu">Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute</A> in 1988, particularly enjoying his courses in Logic,
Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence.  (Historical note: RPI in 1835
became the first school to grant science and engineering degrees in any
English-speaking country.)

<P> Ted was admitted to the PhD program in <A HREF=
"http://www.cs.brown.edu"> Computer Science at Brown University </A> with a
University Fellowship immediately after graduating from RPI.

<P> Ted's interest in <A
HREF="http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/ai/home.html"> Artificial
Intelligence </A> led him to the robotics group under the direction of <A
HREF="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/tld/"> Tom Dean</A>.  There he soon
became involved with motion detection in images or <I>optical flow</I>,
with his thesis advisor <A
HREF="http://www.mpik-tueb.mpg.de/people/personal/hhb/hhb.html"> Heinrich
B&uuml;lthoff</A>.  Despite (or perhaps because of) the limited computing
power then available, Ted immediately made it his mission to develop
techniques for computing optical flow in real-time, without special
image-processing hardware or massively parallel computers.

<P> Ted received his M.S. in Computer Science in 1991 from Brown University
as part of the PhD program, having developed a pyramid-based technique for
segmentation using motion detection.  This ran at about 2 Hz on the AI
Lab's Sun 4/110 in early 1990.  Fast at the time, but not fast enough.

<P> To overcome this, a time-space tradeoff was developed that allowed
tracking applications.  In mid 1990, this algorithm could be used on a
camera mounted on a rotating base to track a person walking at variable
speeds back and forth across a room, with the robot recentering the target
about once every other second, again on the Sun 4/110.  However, the
algorithm was not yet a fully general technique for measuring motion.

<P> In 1991, the algorithm was redesigned to compute true optical flow.
This new approach could detect a limited range of motion at a rate of about
5 frames per second on a Sun Sparc 2.  In addition, software was developed
to display the motion vectors in real-time as well.

<P> By mid 1993 many further algorithmic improvements (and increased
computational power, such as the department's new Sun Sparc 10's) allowed a
much greater range of motion to be detected.  In particular, it was now
practical to examine <I>quantitative</I> optical flow.  However, the
optical flow algorithm's strength was robustness and speed, not accuracy
(or more precisely, precision, no pun intended).  In order to test the
algorithm, a real-world application was needed.

<P> Around this time Ted met <A
HREF="http://www.cog.brown.edu/brochure/people/duchon/home.html">Andrew
Duchon</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.cog.brown.edu/brochure/people/whw/whw.html">Bill
Warren</A> from the <A HREF="http://www.cog.brown.edu/">Cognitive and
Linguistic Sciences Department</A>, who, coincidentally enough, were
looking for an real-time optical flow algorithm to test their theories of
ecological perception on the CS department's robots.  After being exposed
to the application of collision detection using optical flow, he decided to
make this the primary focus of his thesis.


<P> Ted finished his thesis at the <A HREF=
"http://www.mpik-tueb.mpg.de/"> Max-Plank Institute for Biological
Cybernetics</A> with a grant from the German Academic Exchange Service
(DAAD).  The people there, as well as the change of environment, certainly
preserved his sanity during this most hectic period.

<P> Ted received a <A HREF= "http://www.nas.edu"> National Research
Council</A> <A HREF=
"http://isd.cme.nist.gov/staff/coombs/NIST_postdocs.html"> Postdoctoral
Research Associateship</A> in the <A HREF= "http://isd.cme.nist.gov">
Intelligent Systems Division</A> at <A HREF=
"http://www.nist.gov">NIST</A>, in the <A HREF=
"http://isd.cme.nist.gov/orgchart.html#82314">Perception Systems</A> group
(formerly Sensory Intelligence) under the direction of <A HREF=
"http://isd.cme.nist.gov/staff/herman/">Marty Herman</A>.  Ted 
continued his <B><A HREF= "research.html">research</A></B> in real-time
optical flow, focusing on improving accuracy without sacrificing robustness
or speed, as well as its applications such as obstacle avoidance, while at NIST.<P>

Begiining 9/6 Ted will be a Senior MTS at 
<A HREF="http://www.sarnoff.com/sensar.htm">Sensar</A> in Moorestown, N.J.,
working on automatic <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/WEB/0496issue/0496techbus03.html">
iris recognition</A> security systems.

<P>
At <B>Community Products, Inc. (CPI)</B> we believe in the power of
business for positive social change. This company was founded in 1989 
when <A HREF="ben.html">Ben Cohen</A> (the "Ben" half of Ben & Jerry's) became acutely conscious
of the plight facing the world's rainforests.</P>
<P>
The planet has not been saved yet, but CPI had been able to
generate more than <B>$500,000</B> for projects that benefit
the rainforest and other worthwhile causes, while treating
hundreds of thousands of Americans to a new and wonderful taste treat.
</P>
<B>Everyone</B> wins by doing business in a socially responsible way:<BR>
<UL>

	<LI>The local rainforest economies win throught the development 
	of new markets for sustainably harvested products.
	<LI>Our employees win through the creation of jobs here in Vermont.
	<LI>And the consumer wins because a wonderful taste is made better by the
	knowledge that worthwhile causes are being supported.
</UL>

<dl>
<dt><B>Mission:</B><BR>
<dd>Community Products is committed to developing and marketing creative food
products which delight consumers and contribute to the development and
enhancement of sustainable communities. We strive to purchase fairly-traded
ingredients whenever possible and to source ingredients from organizations
that share the common objectives of promoting social equity and the
nurturing of sustainable economic development.
</dl>

<P>
<A HREF="rfc.html">Rainforest Crunch</A>, is the premier product of 
CPI. It is handmade in Vermont from Brazil Nuts sustainably harvested from
the most biologically diverse region of the Amazonian rain forest. By
purchasing sustainably harvested rain forest products, CPI
joins in the larger effort to support the conservation of the rain forest
and its local peoples, by providing  an economic alternative to cutting and
burning the forest.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="src.html">Sweet River Chocolates</A> is CPI's latest offering. 
This new line of scrumptious chocolate bars is also dairy-free!

<DD>I went to this Grateful Dead concert in Madison Square Garden that was
a benefit for the rainforest. At a party after the concert I was introduced
to Jason Clay, an anthropoligist
who was working for Cultural Survival, a group that's trying to help
indigenous cultures around the world to survive. Jason was
working in the rainforest...<BR><BR>
<DD>
...He has calculated that rainforests are more profitable as living rainforests--
by selling the fruits, nuts and rubber that can be sustainably produced--than by
cutting them down.<BR><BR>

...I just got back from the rainforest in Brazil. I saw the nuts--and the
fire, the land that's been deforested. It's pretty bad.
When you fly over the rainforest, there's an incredible amount of smoke
everywhere they're burning the rainforest.</i><BR>
<hr>
</P>
<DL>
<DD>Jason asked, "Can you use some products from the rainforest?"<BR><BR>
</DL>
<DL>
<DD>
I said, "What have you got? Do you have any nuts?" He said sure, Brazil nuts and cashews. I said send me 
these nuts and let me see if I can make nut brittle. I thought one sure
way to get this off the ground is to order a whole bunch of nuts, then I'd be
forced to. So I ordered 15 tons.<BR><BR>

So, Community Products, Inc., is making Rainforest Crunch. It's
going great.<BR><BR>

accepted among major natural food stores across the country." <I>(The Natural

78 Million acres of tropical forest (about the size of New Mexico) are being cut and burned every year. It doesn't have to happen! At Community Products, Inc. we're helping to prove that the rainforest is worth more alive and sustainably harvested.

CPI is committed to the preservation of the Amazonian
Rainforest, its diverse peoples,  cultures, and its unique ecologies.
Through the marketing of Rainforest Crunch and related products and the
purchasing of sustainably harvested products, we strive to work with and
support  organizations who demonstrate respect for the ecological, cultural
and ethnic systems of the region.

</P>
<P>
CPI uses source ingredients harvested from the Amazon
Rainforest as one small part of a larger effort to preserve the Rainforest
through economic incentive.
</P>
<P>
CPI has also been able to commit more than
$500,000 to projects benefiting the rain forest and other environmentally
and socially responsible activities through organizations like Cultural
Survival, Working Assets, and Business for Social Responsibility.
</P>
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="graphics/hbird.gif" ALT="Hummingbird">
<P>
Sweet River Chocolates: Dark Chocolate & Espresso Bar, one of
CPI's newest products,  contains organic
hazelnut espresso beans grown and harvested in a village in Mexico, Pluma
Hidalgo. 2000 families belong to the UCI 100 Years of Solitude Coop which
supply CPI with these coffee beans. The coop belongs to a larger
organization called Aztec Harvest which markets coffee beans for 12
different cooperative organizations in Mexico. Our coffee beans are
purchased at a fair market price to help these coops develop a strong
economic development program for their family farm members.
</P>
<P>
CPI is striving to purchase all of its Brazil nuts for
Rainforest Crunch and Sweet River Chocolates from fair trade organizations.
It has negotiated agreements with Candela, Peru and Campesino Ltd., of
Riberalta, Bolivia, (cooperative organizations) enabling the company to
purchase fairly traded Brazil Nuts.
</P>
<P>
Finally, CPI is committed to using World-Wide Web, via 
the <A HREF="forum.html">Internut Rainforest Forum</A>,  
to raise awareness about the plight of the world's Rainforests.

 Like many other web sites, the Rainforest Crunch Internut is best 
viewed using Netscape 2.0, especially to
enjoy the <A HREF="#anim">animation</A>.
However, if you aren't using the most recent version of Netscape,
don't leave! You can still browse around here successfully. In fact,
it is not necessary to even have images turned on when viewing these
pages; you can navigate successfully without them.</P>
<P>
If you get lost, dazed, or confused on any of the pages here, just 
click on the frog at the top of every page; he will take you back
to the homepage, where you can start over. Every section can be reached
by starting on the home page.</P>

<blockquote>
The ACEER Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  Its purpose is to use innovative and practical strategies to develop sound methods for nonexploitive use of a rainforest habitat.
<P>

Seldom does an individual have the opportunity to make a direct and measurable contribution to a conservation project producing such tangible results as the ACEER -- Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research. 
<P>

The ACEER facility is located in 250,000 acres of primary rainforest deep within the upper Amazon Basin of Peru.  The ACEER provides accommodations and research facilities for scientists, rainforest workshop participants, and travelers.  In addition, the facility functions as a storehouse for information on the rich biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest.  Up until now, nothing like this has existed in the Amazon.  The ACEER is important to the future of the rainforest, as is your support. 
<P>
</blockquote>

<B><A NAME="what">WHAT</A> IS THE ACEER FOUNDATION? </B><BR>

The non-profit ACEER Foundation was established in the United States in 1991 through efforts of International Expeditions, Inc., a U.S. nature travel company, for the preservation of the Amazon rainforest and the protection of its rich biodiversity of plants, animals, and cultures.  It is supported by individuals and private companies committed to preserving rainforest habitats by promoting knowledge, awareness, and proper stewardship of rainforest resources through ecologicallyresponsible tourism, sustainable natural resource management, environmental education, and scientific research. 
<P>

 
<B><A NAME="acc">ACCOMPLISHMENTS</A> SINCE 1991 
</B><BR>

1.  Received over 1,000 passengers each year who learned about the tropical Amazon rainforest, gained an understanding of their connections to the rainforest, and appreciated its natural beauty and biodiversity.  Subsequently, many of these travelers were instrumental in spreading their knowledge and appreciation of rainforest on their return home.  
<P>

2.  Built a 40-passenger facility deep in the Amazon rainforest with sleeping accommodations, baths/showers, kitchen, and communal dining area, so that visitors can experience the rainforest firsthand.
<P>

3.  Completed a Canopy Walkway in the very top of the rainforest ecosystem, allowing visitors, educators, school children, and scientific researchers to view the previously unstudied and inaccessible canopy of the forest.
<P>

4.  Coordinated the Adopt-a-School program, which has paired over fifty (50) Peruvian rural schools in the vicinity of the ACEER facility with U.S. school children and teachers.  They exchange letters, pictures, education materials, and information about their own cultures.
<P>

5.  Sponsored the Peruvian Teacher Training Workshops for rural teachers in the area surrounding ACEER, involving primarily the Adopt-a-School Program teachers who learn handson activities to teach their students relevant environmental education concepts for preservation, protection, and use of the Amazon rainforest.
<P>

6.  Developed an Environmental Education Curriculum and other educational materials for use in local schools.
<P>

7.  Published a Guide to the Frogs of the Iquitos Region, Amazonian Peru, first in a series of field guides to wildlife of the ACEER region.  
<P>

8.  Sponsored a wide variety of workshops, including those for the general public, educators, students, healthcare professionals, and pharmacists.
<P>

9.  Entered into various cooperative agreements with Peruvian universities, governmental and scientific research agencies, technical assistance entities, and NGOs (non-governmental organizations).
<P>

10. Initiated a GIS mapping system, in cooperation with several Peruvian entities, to map the entire region around the facility, thereby providing information needed to make balanced and informed decisions about land use.
<P>

11. Initiated investigations into sustainable development projects that would involve local tribes and encourage sustainable use of the forest.
<P>

12. Approved by the Peruvian government in 1994 as a Peruvian non-profit organization.
<P>

13. Applied with the Peruvian government for permanent protection of 250,000 acres of Peruvian rainforest.
<P>


<B><A NAME="rain">RAINFOREST</A> WORKSHOPS</B><BR>
 
The first International Rainforest Workshop took place in March 1991, in the Peruvian Amazon.  This unprecedented event gave inquisitive individuals, like you, a rare opportunity to learn about the rainforest from some of the world's leading rainforest experts.  Annually in March, the ACEER Foundation, CONAPAC (a Peruvian non-profit organization), Explorama Tours (a Peruvian travel company), and International Expeditions, Inc., sponsor the International Rainforest Workshops.  Each year, the event brings greater international focus on the importance of tropical rainforest to global ecology. 
<P>

In addition to the International Rainforest Workshops, there are also workshops designed especially for educators, students, students and families, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals.  These workshops, offering either continuing education (CEUs) or college credit, address the specific interests of each particular audience.  They offer a wonderful way to network with other travelers who have similar interests and training.
<P>

The Rainforest Workshops raise funds for the ACEER Foundation through participants' user fees.  For registration information on how to participate in these very special travel and learning experiences, call us at 1-800-255-8206. 

<P>
 

<B><A NAME="goals">GOALS</A> OF THE ACEER FOUNDATION </B><BR>

** To equip, maintain, and supply the Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research facility to serve as an international focal point for research scientists, educators, students, and travelers. 
<P>

** To provide environmental and economic benefits to the neighboring inhabitants of the area, while encouraging their participation in the continued development and management of the ACEER. 
<P>

** To maintain the 1200-foot Canopy Walkway, an ecologically sensitive, multi-level system of aerial platforms and pathways.  The walkway enables scientists, educators, students, and visitors to study, observe, and experience the most dynamic and previously inaccessible dimension of the rainforest. 
<P>

** To establish financial support for students, educators, and scientists through scholarship grants and research stipends through funding from individuals, corporations, foundations, and governmental sources.  
<P>

** To expand the protected area to one million acres and ensure its permanent protection through proper infrastructure, skillful management, and local stewardship. 
<P>

** To demonstrate to local inhabitants and visitors the potential of ecologically-responsible tourism as an effective conservation strategy.  The ACEER is designed to impress upon all visitors the vital importance of preserving the rainforest in all its biodiversity. 
<P>

** To work in cooperation with Peruvian governmental and private organizations, research institutes, and universities in behalf of the preservation of the Amazon rainforest and its biodiversity. 

<P>


 
<B><A NAME="bio">BIODIVERSITY</A> OF THE AMAZON</B><BR>

The lush rainforest of the Amazon supports the most prolific and diverse array of flora and fauna found anywhere in the world.  In the upper Amazon Basin of Peru, where the facility is located, over 25,000 species of exotic plants have been identified and more are discovered every day.  The variety of trees is staggering -- a record 318 species having been counted in only a half-square-mile area by the late Dr. Alwyn Gentry of the Missouri Botanical Garden. 
<P>

The biodiversity and abundance of the Amazon is overwhelming.  Almost one-third of the world's 8,600 species of birds are found in the Amazon Basin.  The Peruvian Amazon and adjacent Andean foothills possess the richest butterfly fauna in the world -- over 4,000 species.  The Amazon River is home to over 2,000 species of fish, more than have been described for the entire Atlantic Ocean.  Amphibians and reptiles are well represented.  Sloth, monkey, and caiman are seen along the river, while fresh water dolphins are frequently observed playing and feeding around the shallows. 
<P>

Biodiversity also describes the variety of local peoples living around the ACEER facility.  These include Indian tribes such as Yaguas, Shetebos, Shipibos, Cunibos, and Orejones.  The communities along the river are also composed of Rivereos, who are descended from both European and Indian forebears.  The ACEER offers an opportunity to meet and interact with these local inhabitants.<BR>

<P>
While making Rainforest Crunch is fun, sorting through the nose guesses was also quite entertaining. We got so many guesses for Tom Cruise and Jerry Brown that half-way through we explicitly mentioned it was not these two, yet folks continued to send in these nuts as guesses.

Montpelier, VT -  Beginning World Rainforest Week, October 19-27, one Rainforest Crunch&reg; consumer will have the opportunity to <A HREF="contest.html">win an eight day trip for two into the Amazon Rainforests of Peru </A>with International Expeditions, leader in worldwide nature travel. The drawing will be held in mid-January. Community Products Inc., makers of Rainforest Crunch all natural cashew & Brazil nut buttercrunch, will donate one percent of Rainforest Crunch retail contest sales to<A HREF="aceer.html"> ACEER (Amazon Center for Education & Environmental Research)</A> during the contest period.  ACEER works in cooperation with Peruvian governmental and private organizations, research institutes, universities and local inhabitants on behalf of the preservation of the Amazon rainforest and its biodiversity.  The winner and guest will visit the center in Peru and along with many extraordinary experiences will have an unforgettable walk through the rainforest canopy. 

Rainforest Crunch is made with fairly-traded Brazil nuts and vanilla from alternative trade and cooperative organizations in Central & South America. This provides a market for sustainably harvested products and an economic alternative to rainforest clearing and drilling.

<h2><p align=center>DAIRY-FREE CHOCOLATE: THE NEXT GENERATION</P></h2>
<P>
MONTPELIER, VT - Now there's a chocolate bar that boldly goes where no
other has gone before. Without sacrificing the rich, lusty taste that
chocolate lovers crave, the new <A HREF="src.html">Sweet River Chocolates</A> line of chocolate
bars from the makers of Rainforest Crunch offers a host of fine reasons to
indulge.
</P>
<P>
Sweet River Chocolates are made with all natural ingredients and contain no
preservatives. They are naturally sweetened, so they're perfect for health
minded chocolate lovers. But that's just the beginning. Sweet River
Chocolates are dairy free, so lactose-intolerant consumers can enjoy their
chocolate indulgence, too.
</P>
<P>
Those simply searching for great taste will love the four delectable
flavors - Original Chocolate,  Raspberry, Rainforest Crunch, and Dark
Chocolate & Espresso Beans.
</P>
<P>
And eating Sweet River Chocolates might actually be good for the soul.
Chocolate lovers who want to do their part to help others will appreciate
the fact that Community Products is a company with a conscience. The
company has committed more than a half million dollars to nonprofit groups
making a positive impact in our communities and on the environment.
Sweet River Chocolates are available at natural food stores, specialty food
stores and other fine retailers; call 1-800-927-2695 for locations or mail
order information. The suggested retail price per two-ounce bar is
$1.75

Treat yourself, your friends, and the environment right with 
<A HREF="rfc.html">RAINFOREST CRUNCH!</A>
</P></H3>
<P>
RAINFOREST CRUNCH is an incredibly delicious Cashew & Brazil Nut
Buttercrunch handmade in Vermont from Brazil Nuts sustainably harvested
from the most biologically diverse regions of the Amazonian Rain Forest.
</P>
<P>
Because all of us want to do our part to help others, your friends and
family will appreciate receiving a gift from a company with a conscience.
Community Products was founded in 1989 by Ben Cohen (of Ben & Jerry's fame)
who wanted to do something about the plight facing the world's rain
forests. Scrumptious RAINFOREST CRUNCH was created as a means to support
the conservation of the rain forest and its peoples by purchasing
sustainably harvested products. The rest is history!
</P>
<P>
Community Products has committed more than $500,000 for projects that
benefit the rainforest and other worthwhile causes, while treating hundreds
of thousands of Americans to a tantalizing taste treat.
</P>

flavors: Chocolate, Raspberry, Rainforest Crunch, and Dark Chocolate &
Espresso.

<H3>The Marshall Funds are please to announce that Morningstar, Inc. has
awarded four of our funds with high ratings based on their three-year record
for the period ending September 30, 1996. There were 1,708 Equity funds
and 948 Fixed-Income funds rated for the three-year period.</H3>

<P>Morningstar proprietary ratings reflect historical risk-adjusted performance.
They are subject to change every month. Ratings are calculated from the
funds' 3-, 5- and 10-year average annual returns in excess of 90-day Treasury
bill returns with appropriate fee adjustments, and a risk factor that reflects
fund performance below 90-day T-bill returns. The 1-year period rating is
calculated using the same methodology, but is not a component of the overall
rating. For the 1 year period ended 9/30/96, the Marshall Equity Income
Fund and Marshall Mid-Cap Stock Fund received 5-stars and 4-stars respectively
and were rated among 3,006 Equity funds. The Marshall Short-Term Income
Fund and Marshall Government Income Fund received 4-stars and 3-stars respectively
for the one year period and were rated among 1,506 Fixed-Income funds. Ten
percent of funds in a rating universe 5 stars and the next 22.5% receive
4 stars.</P>

<P>Past performance is no guarantee of future results. * For more information
on these rankings or a prospectus for the Marshall Funds, contact Marshall
Funds Investors Services at 414-287-8595 (4-8595) or 800-236-FUND (3863).
Read prospectus carefully before investing or sending money. * M&amp;I Investment

<P>Data quoted represents past performance and is not indicative of future
results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so when shares
are redeemed they may be worth more or less than the original cost. Total
return represents the change in the value of an investment after reinvesting
all income and capital gains.</P>

<H4>Small-cap funds may experience a higher degree of volatility than others.</H4>

<H5>* The Funds return was achieved over a short period of time and is not
indicative of performance during adverse market conditions.</H5>

<P>The Marshall Small-Cap Stock Fund is the successor to a collective trust
fund. The quoted performance includes performance data for the collective
trust fund for periods before the Fund's registration statement became effective
on August 30, 1996, as adjusted to reflect the Fund's anticipated expenses.
The collective trust fund was not registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 (&quot;1940 Act&quot;) and therefore was not subject to certain
investment restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act. If the collective trust
fund had been registered under 1940 Act, the performance may have been adversely
affected.</P>

per share for the prior 30 days by the maximum offering price per share
on that date. The figure is compounded and annualized.<BR>
<BR>
***Current gross portfolio yield is calculated by annualizing the total
of the most recent dividend payments of the securities owned by the Fund
at the end of the period and dividing by the Fund's net asset value as of
the last day of the period.<BR>
<BR>
**** Total return represents the change in the value of an investment after
reinvesting all income and capital gains.<BR>
<BR>
For an indefinite period of time, the investment adviser may waive all or
part of its fee and, in addition, may reimburse the Fund for some of its
expenses. By taking this action, the Fund's income increases, resulting
in a higher return to investors; otherwise the yield would have been 2.76%,
and total return would also have been lower.<BR>

<P>Data quoted represents past performance and is not indicative of future
results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so when shares
are redeemed they may be worth more or less than the original cost.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Marshall Funds are not deposits or obligations of or endorsed or
guaranteed by M&amp;I Banks, The Fund shares are not federally insured or
guaranteed by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency.
Investments in mutual funds involve risk, including possible loss of principal.<BR>
</B><BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Maturity</B><BR>
Unlike individual securities, mutual fund shares do not mature on a specific
day. All debt securities within the portfolio, however, will have a specific
maturity. For this Fund the average dollar-weighted maturity can be expected
to range from 3 to 10 years. This would be considered an intermediate-term
maturity fund. In general, the shorter the maturity, the less price fluctuation
in response to interest rates. The longer the maturity, however, the higher
the return potential.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Investment Adviser</B><BR>
M&amp;I Investment Management Corp., the adviser, is a registered investment
adviser that currently manages approximately $7 billion in assets for individuals,
corporations, and not-for-profit organizations. Headquartered in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corporation, a $13.3 billion bank holding company
that has over 60 years of investment advisory experience.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dividends</B><BR>
Dividends are declared daily. Dividends can be paid to you in cash or reinvested
in additional Fund shares and credited to your account monthly.<BR>

<B>Distributor</B><BR>
Federated Securities Corp.<BR>
<BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT>This profile must be preceded or accompanied by the Fund's
most recent prospectus.<BR>
<BR>
*Current net yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per
share for the prior 30-days by the maximum offering price per share on that
date. The figure is compounded and annualized.<BR>
<BR>
** The daily distribution rate is calculated by annualizing all regular
dividends declared during the preceding 12 months and reducing that factor
to a daily figure. The 30-day distribution yield is an average of the last
30 daily distribution rate figures of the period.<BR>
<BR>
*** Total return represents the change in the value of an investment after
reinvesting all income and capital gains.<BR>
<BR>
For an indefinite period of time, the investment adviser may waive all or
part of its fee and, in addition, may reimburse the Fund for some of its
expenses. By taking this action, the Fund's income increases, resulting
in a higher return to investors; otherwise the yield would have been 3.99%,
and total return would also have been lower.<BR>
<BR>
+ Income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and state
and local taxes.<BR>
<BR>
++ These ratings apply only to the bonds within the portfolio and do not
protect shares of the fund against market risk.<BR>

<P>Data quoted represents past performance and is not indicative of future
results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so when shares
are redeemed they may be worth more or less than the original cost.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Marshall Funds are not deposits or obligations of or endorsed or
guaranteed by M&amp;I Banks, The Fund shares are not federally insured or
guaranteed by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency.
Investments in mutual funds involve risk, including possible loss of principal.</B></P>

<P><B><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Maturity<BR>
</B>Unlike individual securities, mutual fund shares do not mature on a
specific day. All debt securities within the portfolio, however, will have
a specific maturity. For this Fund the average dollar-weighted maturity
can be expected to range from 2 to 6 years. This would be considered an
intermediate-term maturity fund. In general, the shorter the maturity, the
less price fluctuation in response to interest rates. The longer the maturity,
however, the higher the return potential.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Investment Adviser</B><BR>
M&amp;I Investment Management Corp., the adviser, is a registered investment
adviser that currently manages approximately $7 billion in assets for individuals,
corporations, and not-for-profit organizations. Headquartered in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corporation, a $13.3 billion bank holding company
that has over 60 years of investment advisory experience.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dividends</B><BR>
Dividends are declared daily. Dividends can be paid to you in cash or reinvested
in additional Fund shares and credited to your account monthly.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Distributor</B><BR>
Federated Securities Corp.<BR>
<BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT>This profile must be preceded or accompanied by the Fund's
most recent prospectus.<BR>
<BR>
*Current net yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per
share for the prior 30 days by the maximum offering price per share on that
date. The figure is compounded and annualized.<BR>
<BR>
** The daily distribution rate is calculated by annualizing all regular
dividends declared during the preceding 12 months and reducing that factor
to a daily figure. The 30-day distribution yield is an average of the last
30 daily distribution rate figures of the period.<BR>
<BR>
*** Total return represents the change in the value of an investment after
reinvesting all income and capital gains.<BR>
<BR>
For an indefinite period of time, the investment adviser may waive all or
part of its fee and, in addition, may reimburse the Fund for some of its
expenses. By taking this action, the Fund's income increases, resulting
in a higher return to investors; otherwise the yield would have been 6.06%,
and total return would also have been lower.<BR>
<BR>
+ These ratings apply only to the bonds within the portfolio and do not
protect shares of the fund against market risk.<BR>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Maturity<BR>
</B>Unlike individual securities, mutual fund shares do not mature on a
specific day. All debt securities within the portfolio, however, will have
a specific maturity. For this Fund, the average maturity is 90 days or less,
and the Fund may not acquire any individual security with a remaining maturity
greater than 397 days. This is considered a short-term maturity. In general,
the shorter the maturity, the less price fluctuation in response to interest
rate changes. The longer the maturity date, however, the higher the return
potential.<BR>

*The current 7-day net annualized yield is calculated by dividing the net
investment income per share for the prior 7 days by the maximum offering
price per share on that date. The figure is then annualized.<BR>
<BR>
**The effective 7-day net annualized yield is calculated by dividing the
net investment income per share for the prior 7 days by the maximum offering
price per share on that date. The figure is then annualized and compounded
to reflect the reinvestment of income.<BR>
<BR>
***Total return represents the change in the value of an investment after
reinvesting all income and capital gains.<BR>
<BR>
For an indefinite period of time, the investment adviser may waive all or
part of its fee and, in addition, may reimburse the Fund for some of its
expenses. By taking this action, the Fund's income increases, resulting
in a higher return to investors; otherwise the current 7-day yield would
have been 4.83%, and total return would also have been lower.<BR>
<BR>
+Performance quoted is for the A Shares Class of the Fund. The B Shares,
another class of shares, are sold primarily to retail customers of institutions
that have entered into a marketing arrangement, or that provide sales and/or
administrative services, for the sale of Fund shares and are subject to
Rule 12b-1 fees. Performance for B Shares will be less than that for A Shares
due to differences in expenses borne by shares of each class. As of 8/31/96,
the current 7-day yield and the effective 7-day yield for B Shares was 4.81%
and 4.93% respectively. Total return performance of the B Shares corresponding
to that given for A Shares was: 1 Year (as of 6/30/96) 5.16%; 12/17/92 (date
of B Shares' inception) through 6/30/96, 4.10%; month of August, 0.41%;
Last 3 Months, 1.22%; Last 12 Months, 5.07%; Calendar YTD, 3.27%; Calendar
Year 1995, 5.47%; Calendar Year 1994, 3.75%; Calendar Year 1993, 2.68%.<BR>

<P>WHO MANAGES THE FUNDS?</P>

<P>M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. serves as investment adviser (the
&quot;Adviser&quot;) to the Marshall Funds. The Adviser is owned by Marshall
&amp; Ilsley Corp. (&quot;M&amp;I Corp.&quot;) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Templeton Investment Counsel, Inc. of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida serves as
sub adviser (the &quot;Subadviser&quot;) to the Marshall International Stock
Fund.</P>

<P>WHAT ABOUT INVESTMENT RISKS?</P>

<P>All mutual funds, including the Marshall Funds, take investment risks.
The Stock Funds must contend with the volatility and unpredictability of
the U.S. stock market. The Marshall International Stock Fund may experience
additional uncertainty in foreign markets and with foreign currency transactions.
The Marshall Small-Cap Stock Fund involves special risks since it invests
primarily in stocks of smaller-capitalized companies, which have historically
been more volatile than stocks of larger companies. The Income Funds invest
heavily in debt securities,whose values move in the opposite direction of
prevailing interest rates and whose exposure to market price fluctuation
increase with the lengthening of their maturities. Some of the Marshall
Funds may use options and futures contracts to hedge their investments or
increase their income, although the successful use of such investment techniques
cannot be guaranteed and may result in a loss instead. Each Marshall Fund
may invest at least some of its assets in mortgage-backed securities and
may lend its portfolio securities to other institutions. The risks associated
with these and other investments are fully explained under &quot;Portfolio
Investments and Strategies&quot; and &quot;Additional Investment Risks.&quot;</P>

<P>In all types of investments, reward and risk go hand in hand. If you
seek high investment returns, you must be willing to assume a comparably
higher level of risk. On the other hand, if you are comfortable with only
a small amount of risk, you should not expect a large return. Set forth
below is a risk/reward chart that explains the investment potential and
corresponding risks associated with different types of mutual funds and
investments. The Marshall Funds are listed under the relevant categories.</P>

<P>At the top of the chart are equity funds and stocks, which have historically
produced over the long-term a higher level of return than other types of
investments, but also have the highest potential risk. In the middle of
the chart are income funds and bonds, which offer a middle range of potential
risk and return. At the bottom of the chart are money market funds and money
market instruments, which have a lower amount of risk and return. As with
any investment, however, past performance does not predict future performance.
Your investment return will vary, and the redemption value of your mutual
fund shares may be lower than their original purchase price.</P>

  <LI>any other &quot;eligible guarantor institution,&quot; as defined in
  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
</UL>

<P>The Corporation and its transfer agent have adopted standards for accepting
signature guarantees from the above institutions. The Corporation may elect
in the future to limit eligible signature guarantors to institutions that
are members of a signature guarantee program. The Corporation and its transfer
agent reserve the right to amend these standards at any time without notice.</P>

<P><B>Redemption Before Purchase Instruments Clear</B>.When you purchase
Fund shares by check or through the Automated Clearing House system, the
proceeds from the redemption of those shares (whether redeemed by mail,
by telephone or by check writing) are not available, and the shares may
not be exchanged, until MFIS is reasonably certain that the purchase check
has cleared, which could take up to seven calendar days.</P>

<P><B>Accounts With Low Balances</B>. Due to the high cost of maintaining
accounts with low balances, the Fund may redeem shares in your account and
pay you the proceeds if your account balance falls below the required minimum
value of $1,000. Before shares are redeemed to close an account, you will
be notified in writing and allowed 30 days to purchase additional shares
to meet the minimum account balance requirement.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Exchange Privilege</H2>

<P>You may exchange shares of a Marshall Fund (including the Fund's shares)
for shares of any of the other Marshall Funds at net asset value without
a sales charge, provided you have received a copy of the current prospectus
of the other Marshall Fund,and you meet the investment minimum of the Marshall
Fund. The exchange privilege is available to shareholders residing in any
state in which the Marshall Fund shares you are acquiring may legally be
sold.</P>

<P>Upon receipt of proper instructions and all necessary supporting documents,
the Marshall Fund's shares you submit for exchange will be redeemed at the
next-determined net asset value. Written exchange instructions may require
a signature guarantee. See &quot;Signature Guarantees&quot; above. An exchange
is treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and, depending on the
circumstances, you may realize a short or long-term capital gain or loss.
The exchange privilege may be terminated at any time, and you will be notified
of such termination. You may obtain further information on the exchange
privilege by calling MFIS.</P>

<P>With the exception of Marshall Money Market Fund, the other Marshall
Funds currently offer only one class of shares. If such funds should add
a second class of shares, exchanges may be limited to shares of the same
class of each Marshall Fund.</P>

<P><B>Exchanging Securities for Fund Shares</B>. The Fund may accept securities
in exchange for Fund shares. The Fund will allow such exchanges only upon
prior approval of the Fund and a determination by the Fund and the adviser
that the securities to be exchanged are acceptable. Any securities exchanged
must meet the investment objective and policies of the Fund, must have a
readily ascertainable market value, and must be liquid. The market value
of any securities exchanged in an initial investment, plus any cash, must
be at least equal to the minimum investment in the Fund. The Fund acquires
the exchanged securities for investment and not for resale.</P>

<P>Any interest accrued or dividends declared but not paid on the securities
prior to the exchange will be considered in valuing the securities. All
interest, dividends, subscription or other rights attached to the securities
become the property of the Fund, along with the securities.</P>

<P>If an exchange is permitted, it will be treated as a sale for federal
income tax purposes. Depending upon the cost basis of the securities exchanged
for Fund shares, a gain or loss may be realized by the investor.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Telephone Transactions</H2>

<P>If you have completed a telephone authorization section in your account
application or have completed an authorization form obtained through MFIS
or M&amp;I Brokerage Services, you may telephone instructions to MFIS to
redeem Fund shares or to request a purchase of Marshall Fund shares by exchanging
between Marshall Fund accounts that have identical shareholder registrations.
Customers of other broker- dealers, financial institutions, or service providers
should contact their account officer. Trust customers should contact their
account officer. Telephone exchange instructions must be received before
3:00 p.m. (Central Time) for shares to be exchanged the same day. However,
you will not receive a dividend of the Marshall Fund into which you exchange
on the date of the exchange. Telephone redemption requests are subject to
the time requirements explained above in &quot;How to Redeem Fund Shares.'</P>

<P>'Shares held in certificate form cannot be exchanged or redeemed by telephone.
Instead, you must forward the certificates to the transfer agent through
MFIS for credit to your mutual fund account before they can be exchanged
or redeemed.</P>

<P>Shareholders requesting a telephone exchange or redemption service authorize
the Fund and its agents to act upon their telephonic instructions to exchange
or redeem shares from any account for which they have authorized such services.
Telephone instructions may be recorded. If reasonable procedures are not
followed by the Marshall Funds, they may be liable for losses due to unauthorized
or fraudulent telephone instructions.</P>

<P>The telephone privileges may be modified or terminated at any time. You
will be notified of such modification or termination. During times of drastic
economic or market changes, you may experience difficulty in making exchanges
or redemptions by telephone through banks, brokers, and other financial
institutions. In such cases, you should make the exchange or redemption
request in writing and send it by overnight mail.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Marshall Funds, Inc.Information</H2>

<P>ORGANIZATION AND HISTORY</P>

<P>The Corporation was incorporated under the laws of Wisconsin on July
31, 1992. The Corporation may offer separate series of shares representing
interests in separate portfolios of securities, and the shares in any one
portfolio may be offered in separate classes.</P>

<P>MANAGEMENT</P>

<P><B>Board of Directors</B>. The Directors are responsible for managing
the business affairs of the Corporation and for exercising all of the powers
of the Corporation except those reserved for the shareholders.</P>

<P><B>Investment Adviser</B>. Pursuant to an investment advisory contract
with the Corporation, M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. serves as the
investment adviser (the &quot;Adviser&quot;) to the Fund, subject to direction
by the Directors. The Adviser continually conducts investment research and
supervision for the Fund and is responsible for the purchase and sale of
portfolio instruments, for which it receives an annual fee from the Fund.</P>

<P>Both the Corporation and the Adviser have adopted strict codes of ethics
governing the conduct of all employees who manage the Marshall Funds and
their portfolio securities. These codes recognize that such persons owe
a fiduciary duty to the Marshall Funds' shareholders and must place the
interests of shareholders ahead of the employees' own interests. Among other
things, the codes: require pre-clearance and periodic reporting of personal
securities transactions; prohibit personal transactions in securities being
purchased or sold, or being considered for purchase or sale, by the Marshall
Funds; prohibit purchasing securities in initial public offerings; and prohibit
taking profits on securities held for less than sixty days. Violations of
the codes are subject to review by the Board of Directors, and could result
in severe penalties.</P>

<P><B>Advisory Fees</B>. The Adviser is entitled to receive an annual investment
advisory fee equal to 1.00%. The fee paid by the Fund may be higher than
the advisory fees paid by mutual funds in general but is comparable to the
fee paid by many mutual funds with objectives and policies similar to the
Fund. The investment advisory contract allows the voluntary waiver in whole
or in part of the investment advisory fees or the reimbursement of expenses
by the Adviser from time to time. The Adviser can terminate any voluntary
waiver of its fees or reimbursement of expenses at any time at its sole
discretion.</P>

<P>Investment decisions for the Fund will be made independently from those
of any fiduciary or other accounts that may be managed by the Adviser or
its affiliates. If, however, such accounts, the Fund, or the Adviser for
its own account, are simultaneously engaged in transactions involving the
same securities,the transactions may be combined and allocated to each account.
Although this system may adversely affect the price the Fund pays or receives,
or the size of the position it obtains, it may also enable the Fund to benefit
from lower transaction costs.</P>

<P><B>Adviser's Background</B>. M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. is a
registered investment adviser and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marshall
&amp; Ilsley Corp., a registered bank holding company headquartered in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. As of April 30, 1996, M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. had
approximately $7.3 billion in assets under management and has managed investments
for individuals and institutions since its inception in 1973. The Adviser
has managed the Fund since its inception, has managed the other Marshall
Funds since 1992, and managed the Newton Funds (predecessors to certain
of the Marshall Funds) since 1985. As part of its regular banking operations,
affiliates of the Adviser may make loans to public companies. Thus, it may
be possible, from time to time, for the Fund to hold or acquire securities
of issuers which are also lending clients of the Adviser's affiliates. The
lending relationship will not be a factor in the selection of securities.</P>

<P>The Fund is co-managed by Steve D. Hayward and David Lettenberger. Prior
to joining M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. as Vice President in December
1993, Mr. Hayward served as Senior Portfolio Manager of AMOCO Corporation
and managed two aggressive growth-oriented mutual funds for American Asset
Capital Management. Mr. Hayward, who is a Chartered Financial Analyst, received
a B.A. in Economics from North Park College, and an M.B.A. in Finance from
Loyola University. Prior to joining M&amp;I Investment Management Corp.
in 1993,Mr. Lettenberger was employed by M&amp;I Marshall &amp;Ilsley Bank.
He has been an analyst on the Marshall Mid-Cap Stock Fund since the fund's
inception during 1993. Mr. Lettenberger holds a B.B.A. degree in Finance
and Economics from Marquette University and has completed the Chartered
Financial Analyst program.</P>

<P>DISTRIBUTION OF FUND SHARES</P>

<P>Federated Securities Corp., a subsidiary of Federated Investors, is the
principal distributor for shares of the Marshall Funds and a number of other
investment companies. The distributor may offer certain items of nominal
value from time to time to any shareholder or investor in connection with
the sale of Fund shares.</P>

<P><B>Administrative Arrangements</B>. The distributor may select brokers,
dealers and administrators (including depository or other institutions such
as commercial banks and savings associations) to provide distribution and/or
administrative services for which they will receive fees from the distributor
based upon shares owned by their clients or customers. These administrative
services include distributing prospectuses and other information, providing
account assistance, and communicating or facilitating purchases and redemptions
of the Fund's shares. The fees are calculated as a percentage of the average
aggregate net asset value of shareholder accounts held during the period
for which the brokers, dealers, and administrators provide services. Any
fees paid for these services by the distributor will be reimbursed by the
Adviser and not the Fund.</P>

<P><B>Distribution Plan</B>. Under a Rule 12b-1 Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;),
the Fund may pay to the distributor an amount computed at an annual rate
of 0.25% of the average daily net asset value of Fund shares to finance
any activity which is principally intended to result in the sale of the
shares subject to the Plan (&quot;Plan Shares&quot;). The distributor may,
from time to time and for such periods as it deems appropriate, voluntarily
reduce its compensation under the Plan. The Fund has no present intention
of paying or accruing any fees under the Plan during the fiscal year ending
August 31, 1997.</P>

<P>The distributor may select certain entities to provide sales and/or administrative
services as agents for holders of Plan Shares. Administrative services may
include, but are not limited to, the following functions: providing office
space, equipment, telephone facilities, and various clerical, supervisory,
computer, and other personnel as necessary or beneficial to establish and
maintain shareholder accounts and records; processing purchase and redemption
transactions and automatic investments of client account cash balances;
answering routine client inquiries regarding Plan Shares; assisting clients
in changing dividend options, account designations, and addresses; and providing
such other services as the Fund reasonably requests. Such entities will
receive fees from the distributor based upon Plan Shares owned by their
clients or customers. The schedules of such fees and the basis upon which
such fees will be paid will be determined from time to time by the distributor.</P>

<P>The Fund's Plan is a compensation type plan. As such, the Fund makes
no payments to the distributor except as described above. Therefore, the
Fund does not pay for unreimbursed expenses of the distributor,including
amounts expended by the distributor in excess of amounts received by it
from the Fund, interest, carrying or other financing charges in connection
with excess amounts expended, or the distributor's overhead expenses. However,
the distributor may be able to recover such amount or may earn a profit
from future payments made by the Fund under the Plan.</P>

<P>The Glass-Steagall Act prohibits a depository institution (such as a
commercial bank or a savings association) from being an underwriter or distributor
of most securities. In the event the Glass-Steagall Act is deemed to prohibit
depository institutions from acting in the administrative capacities described
above or should Congress relax current restrictions on depository institutions,
the Directors will consider appropriate changes in the services.</P>

<P>State securities laws governing the ability of depository institutions
to act as underwriters or distributors of securities may differ from interpretations
given to the Glass-Steagall Act and, therefore, banks and financial institutions
may be required to register as dealers pursuant to state law. In addition,
some state securities laws may require administrators to register as brokers
and dealers.</P>

<P><B>Other Payments to Financial Institutions</B>. The distributor, the
Adviser or their affiliates, at their own expense and out of their own assets,
may also provide other compensation to broker-dealers, institutions and
other service providers in connection with sales of Fund shares or as financial
assistance for providing substantial marketing, sales and operational support.
The support may include initiating customer accounts, providing sales literature,
or participating in sales, educational and training seminars (including
those held at recreational facilities).Such assistance will be predicated
upon the amount of shares of the Fund or the Corporation the institution
sells or may sell and/or upon the type and nature of sales, operational
or marketing support furnished by the institution. Any payments made by
the distributor may be reimbursed by the Adviser or its affiliates.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Administration of the Fund</H2>

<P><B>Administrative Services</B>. Federated Administrative Services (&quot;FAS&quot;),
a subsidiary of Federated Investors, provides the Fund with certain administrative
personnel and services necessary to operate the Fund, such as legal and
accounting services. FAS provides these services for an annual fee equal
to .12 of 1% of the Fund's average daily net assets.</P>

<P>The administrative fee received during any fiscal year shall be at least
$50,000. FAS may choose voluntarily to reimburse a portion of its fee at
any time.</P>

<P><B>Shareholder Servicing Arrangements</B>. The Fund has entered into
a Shareholder Services Agreement with Federated Shareholder Services Company,
a subsidiary of Federated Investors, under which the Fund may make payments
up to 0.25% of the average daily net asset value of shares of the Fund to
obtain certain personal services for shareholders and to maintain shareholder
accounts (&quot;Shareholder Services&quot;). Under the Shareholder Services
Agreement, Federated Shareholder Services will either perform Shareholder
Services directly or will select broker- dealers, financial institutions
or other service providers to perform Shareholder Services (including Marshall
Funds Investor Services, a division of M&amp;I Trust Company). Broker-dealers,
financial institutions or other service providers will receive fees based
upon shares owned by their clients or customers. The schedules of such fees
and the basis upon which fees will be paid will be determined from time
to time by the Fund and Federated Shareholder Services.</P>

<P>In addition to payments made pursuant to the Shareholder Services Agreement,
Federated Securities Corp. and Federated Shareholder Services, from their
own assets, may pay broker-dealers, financial institutions and other service
providers supplemental fees for their performance of sales services, distribution
related support services, or Shareholder Services.</P>

<P>BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS</P>

<P>When selecting brokers and dealers to handle the purchase and sale of
portfolio instruments, the Adviser looks for prompt execution of the order
at a favorable price. In working with dealers, the Adviser will generally
utilize those who are recognized dealers in specific portfolio instruments,
except when a better price and execution of the order can be obtained elsewhere.
In selecting among firms believed to meet these criteria, the Adviser may
give consideration to those firms which have sold or are selling shares
of the Fund and other mutual funds distributed by Federated Securities Corp.
The Adviser makes decisions on portfolio transactions and select brokers
and dealers subject to review by the Directors.</P>

<P>EXPENSES OF THE FUNDS</P>

<P>The Fund pays all of its own expenses and its allocable share of the
Corporation's expenses. These expenses include, but are not limited to,
the cost of: organizing the Corporation and continuing its existence; Directors'
fees; investment advisory and administrative services; printing prospectuses
and other Fund documents for shareholders; registering the Corporation,
the Fund, and shares of the Fund with federal and state securities authorities;
taxes and commissions; issuing, purchasing, repurchasing, and redeeming
shares; fees for custodians, transfer agents, dividend disbursing agents,
shareholder servicing agents, and registrars; printing, mailing, auditing,
and certain accounting and legal expenses;reports to shareholders; meetings
of Directors and shareholders and proxy solicitations there for; insurance
premiums; association membership dues; and such non-recurring and extraordinary
items as may arise. However, the Adviser may voluntarily reimburse some
expenses and, in addition, has undertaken to reimburse the Fund up to the
amount of its advisory fee, the amount by which operating expenses exceed
limitations imposed by certain states.</P>

<P>CERTIFICATES AND CONFIRMATIONS</P>

<P>As transfer agent for the Fund, Federated Shareholder Services Company
maintains a share account for each shareholder of record. Upon written request,you
can receive share certificates without charge, but only for whole shares
of the Fund. You may contact MFIS to direct the transfer agent to issue
you certificates or deliver certificates for redemption or credit to your
account. Federated Shareholder Services Company is a subsidiary of Federated
Investors.</P>

<P>The Fund will send you a detailed confirmation of each purchase or redemption
or dividend payment. At a minimum, you will receive a monthly statement.
You may request photocopies of confirmations for transactions affecting
your account in prior years at a fee of $5 per year to cover the cost of
obtaining this information.</P>

<P>DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS</P>

<P>dividends of the Fund are declared and paid quarterly. Only shareholders
invested in the Fund on the record date of the dividend declaration are
paid that dividend. Capital gains, when realized by the Fund,will be distributed
at least once every 12 months.Unless you request cash payments by writing
to the Fund, your dividends and capital gains are automatically reinvested
in additional shares of the Fund on payment dates at the ex-dividend date
net asset value.</P>

<P>COMMON STOCK AND VOTING RIGHTS</P>

<P>The Directors have authorized the issuance of shares of Common Stock
representing ownership interests in the Fund. You are entitled to one vote
for each full share of Common Stock and proportionate fractional votes for
fractional shares. All shares of each Marshall Fund or class in the Corporation
have equal voting rights and will generally vote in the aggregate and not
by Marshall Fund or class, unless required bylaw. For example, only shares
of a particular Marshall Fund or class are entitled to vote on matters affecting
that Marshall Fund or class. Voting rights are not cumulative; consequently,
the holders of more than 50% of the Corporation's shares of Common Stock
can elect the entire Board of Directors.</P>

<P>The Corporation does not intend to hold annual meetings of shareholders,
unless required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 or applicable law.Directors
may be removed by the Directors or by the shareholders at a special meeting,
which may be called by the Directors upon written request of shareholders
owning at least 10% of the Corporation's outstanding voting shares.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Performance Information</H2>

<P>From time to time, the Fund may advertise total return and yield.</P>

<P>Total return represents the change, over a specified period of time,
in the value of an investment in the Fund after reinvesting all income and
capital gains distributions. It is calculated by dividing that change by
the initial investment and is expressed as a percentage.</P>

<P>The yield for the Fund is calculated by dividing the net investment income
per share (as defined by the SEC) earned by a class of shares over a thirty-day
period by the offering price per share of that class of shares on the last
day of the period. This number is then annualized using semi-annual compounding.
The yield does not necessarily reflect income actually earned by that class
of shares and, therefore, may not correlate to the dividends or other distributions
paid to shareholders.</P>

<P>From time to time, the advertisements for the Fund may refer to ratings,
rankings, and other information in certain financial publications and/or
compare the performance of the Fund to certain indices.</P>

<P>The Fund is the successor to the portfolio of a collective trust fund
managed by the Adviser. It is anticipated that, at the Fund's commencement
of operations, the assets from the collective trust fund will be transferred
to the Fund in exchange for Fund shares. The Adviser has represented that
the Fund's investment objective, policies and limitations are in all material
respects identical to those of the collective trust fund.</P>

<P>The Fund's total return for the period from November 1, 1995 (date of
commencement of operations of the collective trust fund) to June 30, 1996
was 77.49%. The quoted performance data includes the performance of the
collective trust fund for periods before the Fund's registration statement
became effective, as adjusted to reflect the Fund's anticipated expenses
as set forth in the &quot;Expenses of the Fund&quot; section of this prospectus.
The collective trust fund was not registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 (&quot;1940 Act&quot;) and therefore was not subject to certain
investment restrictions that are imposed by the 1940 Act. If the collective
trust fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the performance may have
been adversely affected.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Portfolio Investments and Strategies</H2>

<P><B>Asset-Backed Securities</B>. The Fund may invest in Asset-Backed Securities
rated, at the time of purchase, in the top three rating categories, by an
NRSRO (A or better by S&amp;P, Fitch or Moody's), or, if unrated, of comparable
quality as determined by the Adviser. Asset-Backed Securities have structural
characteristics similar to Mortgage-Backed Securities but have underlying
assets that generally are not mortgage loans or interests in mortgage loans.
The Fund may invest in Asset-Backed Securities including, but not limited
to, interests in pools of receivables, such as motor vehicle installment
purchase obligations and credit card receivables, equipment leases, manufactured
housing (mobile home) leases,or home equity loans. These securities may
be in the form of pass-through instruments or asset-backed bonds. The securities
are issued by non-governmental entities and carry no direct or indirect
government guarantee.</P>

<P><B>Bank Instruments</B>. The Fund may invest in domestic Bank Instruments,
which are instruments (including time and savings deposits, bankers' acceptances
and certificates of deposit) of banks and savings and loans that have capital,
surplus and undivided profits of over $100 million or for which the principal
amount of the instrument is insured by the Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings
Association Insurance Fund,which are administered by the FDIC. To a limited
extent (up to 5% of the Fund's total assets), the Fund may purchase foreign
Bank Instruments, which include Eurodollar Certificates of Deposit (&quot;ECDs&quot;),
Yankee Certificates of Deposit (&quot;Yankee CDs&quot;) and Eurodollar Time
Deposits (&quot;ETDs&quot;). ECDs are U.S. dollar-denominated certificates
of deposits issued by foreign branches of U.S. banks or foreign banks. Yankee
CDs are U.S. dollar-denominated certificates of deposits issued in the U.S.
by branches and agencies of foreign banks. ETDs are U.S. dollar-denominated
deposits in foreign branches of U.S. banks or foreign banks. The Fund will
treat securities credit enhanced with a bank's irrevocable letter of credit
or unconditional guaranty as Bank Instruments.</P>

<P><B>Convertible Securities</B>. The Fund may invest in convertible securities
which are rated, at the time of purchase, investment grade by an NRSRO (such
as BBB or better by S&amp;P or Fitch, or Baa or better by Moody's), or,
if unrated, are of comparable quality as determined by the Adviser. Convertible
securities are fixed income securities which may be exchanged or converted
into a predetermined number of the issuer's underlying common stock at the
option of the holder during a specified time period. Convertible securities
may take the form of convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock or debentures,
units consisting of &quot;usable&quot; bonds and warrants or a combination
of the features of several of these securities. The investment characteristics
of each convertible security vary widely, which allows convertible securities
to be employed for different investment objectives. In selecting a convertible
security, the Adviser evaluates the investment characteristics of the convertible
security as a fixed income instrument, and the investment potential of the
underlying security for capital appreciation.</P>

<P>Convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks generally retain the
investment characteristics of fixed income securities until they have been
converted but also react to movements in the underlying equity securities.
The holder is entitled to receive the fixed income of a bond or the dividend
preference of a preferred stock until the holder elects to exercise the
conversion privilege. Usable bonds are corporate bonds that can be used
in whole or in part, customarily at full face value, in lieu of cash to
purchase the issuer's common stock. Convertible securities are senior to
equity securities, and therefore have a claim to assets of the corporation
prior to the holders of common stock in the case of liquidation. However,
convertible securities are generally subordinated to similar nonconvertible
securities of the same company. The interest income and dividends from convertible
bonds and preferred stocks provide a stable stream of income with generally
higher yields than common stocks, but lower than nonconvertible securities
of similar quality. The Fund will exchange or convert the convertible securities
held in its portfolio into shares of the underlying common stocks when,
in the opinion of the Adviser, the investment characteristics of the underlying
common shares will assist the Fund in achieving its investment objective.
Otherwise, the Fund will hold or trade the convertible securities.</P>

<P><B>Depositary Receipts</B>. The Fund may invest in ADRs. ADRs are Depositary
Receipts typically issued by a U.S. bank or trust company which evidence
ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. Generally,
Depositary Receipts in registered form are designed for use in the U.S.
securities market and Depositary Receipts in bearer form are designed for
use in securities markets outside the United States. Depositary Receipts
may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the underlying
securities into which they may be converted. Ownership of un-sponsored Depositary
Receipts may not entitle the Fund to financial or other reports from the
issuer of the underlying security, to which it would be entitled as the
owner of sponsored Depositary Receipts. Depositary Receipts also involve
the risks of other investments in foreign securities.</P>

<P><B>Illiquid Securities</B>. These are any securities the Fund owns which
it may not be able to sell quickly (within seven days) at a fair price.
The Fund's investments in illiquid securities may not exceed 15% of its
net assets.</P>

<P><B>Lending Portfolio Securities</B>. In order to generate additional
income, the Fund is permitted as a fundamental investment policy to lend
portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, or both, up to
one-third of the value of its total assets to broker/dealers, banks, or
other institutional borrowers of securities. The Fund will only enter into
loan arrangements with broker/dealers, banks, or other institutions which
the Adviser has determined are creditworthy under guidelines established
by the Directors and will receive collateral in the form of cash, U.S. government
securities or other high quality liquid money market instruments equal to
at least 100% of the value of the securities loaned. Collateral received
in the form of cash may be invested in highly liquid investments, including
repurchase agreements and other money market instruments.</P>

<P>There is the risk that when lending portfolio securities,the securities
may not be available to the Fund on a timely basis and the Fund may, therefore,
lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable price.In addition,
in the event that a borrower of securities would file for bankruptcy or
become insolvent, disposition of the securities may be delayed pending court
action.</P>

<P><B>Mortgage-Backed Securities</B>. The Fund may invest in Mortgage-Backed
Securities rated, at the time of purchase, in the top three rating categories
by an NRSRO (A or better by S&amp;P, Fitch or Moody's), or, if unrated,
of comparable quality as determined by the Fund's Adviser. Mortgage-Backed
Securities are securities that directly or indirectly represent a participation
in, or are secured by and payable from, mortgage loans on real property.
The Fund may invest in Mortgage-Backed Securities that are issued or guaranteed
by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities, such
as the Government National Mortgage Association (&quot;Ginnie Mae&quot;),
the Federal National Mortgage Association (&quot;Fannie Mae&quot;) and Federal
Home Loan National Mortgage Corporation (&quot;Freddie Mac&quot;).</P>

<P><B>Adjustable Rate Mortgage Securities</B>. Adjustable rate mortgage
securities (&quot;ARMS&quot;) are pass- through mortgage securities with
adjustable rather than fixed interest rates. The ARMS in which the Fund
invests are issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac and are actively
traded. The underlying mortgages which collateralize ARMS issued by Ginnie
Mae are fully guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (&quot;FHA&quot;)
or Veterans Administration (&quot;VA&quot;), while those collateralizing
ARMS issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are typically conventional residential
mortgages conforming to strict underwriting size and maturity constraints.</P>

<P><B>Options On Securities or Indices and Futures Contracts</B>. In order
to hedge against market shifts, the Fund may purchase put and call options
on securities or securities indices. In addition, the Fund may seek to generate
income to offset operating expenses and/or may hedge a portion of its portfolio
investments through writing (i.e., selling) covered put and call options.
An option on a security is a contract that permits the purchaser of the
option, in return for the premium paid, the right to buy a specified security
(in the case of a call option) or to sell a specified security (in the case
of a put option) from or to the writer of the option at a designated price
during the term of the option. An option on a securities index permits the
purchaser of the option, in return for the premium paid, the right to receive
from the seller cash equal to the difference between the closing price of
the index and the exercise price of the option. The Fund may write a call
or put option only if the option is &quot;covered.&quot; This means that
so long as the Fund is obligated as the writer of a call option, it will
own the underlying securities subject to the call, or hold a call at the
same exercise price, for the same exercise period, and on the same securities
as the written call. A put is covered if the Fund maintains liquid assets
with a value equal to the exercise price in a segregated account, or holds
a put on the underlying securities at an equal or greater exercise price.
The value of the underlying securities on which options may be written at
any one time will not exceed 50% of the net assets of the Fund. The Fund
will not purchase put or call options if the aggregate premium paid for
such options would exceed 5% of its total assets at the time of the purchase.</P>

<P>Options purchased or written by the Fund may be traded on United States
and foreign exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets. Over-the-counter
options are two-party contracts with price and terms negotiated between
buyer and seller. In contrast, exchange-traded options are third-party contracts
with standardized strike prices and expiration dates and are purchased from
a clearing corporation. Exchange-traded options generally have a continuous
liquid market while over-the-counter options may not. The Fund purchases
and writes options only with investment dealers and other financial institutions
(such as commercial banks or savings and loan associations) deemed creditworthy
by the Fund's Adviser.</P>

<P>The Fund may invest in futures for bona fide hedging purposes. Although
the Fund has the ability to invest up to 5% of its net assets in futures
for other than bona fide hedging purposes, it has no present intention of
doing so. The ability to engage in futures transactions is a fundamental
investment policy. For hedging purposes only, the Fund may buy and sell
covered financial futures contracts, stock index futures contracts, foreign
currency futures contracts and options on any of the foregoing. A financial
futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a specified
debt security at a set price on a future date. An index futures contract
is an agreement to take or make delivery of an amount of cash based on the
difference between the value of the index at the beginning and at the end
of the contract period. A futures contract on a foreign currency is an agreement
to buy or sell a specified amount of a currency for a set price on a future
date. When the Fund enters into a futures contract, it must make an initial
deposit, known as &quot;initial margin,&quot; as a partial guarantee of
its performance under the contract. As the value of the security, index,
or currency fluctuates, either party to the contract is required to make
additional margin payments, known as &quot;variation margin,&quot; to cover
any additional obligation it may have under the contract. In addition, when
the Fund enters into a futures contract, it will segregate assets to &quot;cover&quot;
its position in accordance with the Act. See &quot;Investment Objectives
and Policies Futures and Options Transactions&quot; in the Statement of
Additional Information.</P>

<P><B>Portfolio Turnover</B>. Although the Fund does not intend to invest
for the purpose of seeking short-term profits, securities will be sold whenever
the Fund's Adviser believes it is appropriate to do so in light of the Fund's
investment objective, without regard to the length of time a particular
security may have been held. The Fund anticipates its portfolio turnover
rate will not exceed 200%. A higher rate of portfolio turnover involves
correspondingly greater transaction expenses which must be borne directly
by the Fund and,thus, indirectly by its shareholders. In addition, a high
rate of portfolio turnover may result in the realization of larger amounts
of capital gains which, when distributed to the Fund's shareholders, are
taxable to them.Nevertheless, transactions for the Fund's portfolio will
be based upon investment considerations and will not be limited by any other
considerations when the Fund's Adviser deems it appropriate to make changes
in the Fund's portfolio.</P>

<P><B>Ratings</B>. Securities rated in the fourth highest investment grade
category (Baa by Moody's, or BBB by S&amp;P or Fitch), have speculative
characteristics and changes in economic conditions or other circumstances
are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to make principal and interest
payments than higher rated securities. The Fund's Statement of Additional
Information contains complete descriptions of ratings.</P>

<P>The Fund's Adviser will evaluate downgraded securities on a case-by-case
basis and will sell any security determined not to be an acceptable investment.</P>

<P><B>Restricted Securities</B>. The Fund may invest in restricted securities.
These are securities in which the Fund normally invests but which are subject
to legal restrictions when the Fund sells them. Restricted securities which
are not determined by the Directors to be liquid will be limited to 5% of
the Fund's total assets.</P>

<P><B>Repurchase Agreements</B>. The securities in which the Fund invests
may be purchased pursuant to repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements
are arrangements in which banks, broker/dealers, and other recognized financial
institutions sell U.S. government securities or other securities to the
Fund and agree at the time of sale to repurchase them at a mutually agreed
upon time and price. To the extent that the original seller does not repurchase
the securities from the Fund, the Fund could receive less than the repurchase
price on any sale of such securities.</P>

<P><B>Securities of Other Investment Companies</B>. The Fund may invest
in the securities of other investment companies, but will not own more than
3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any investment company, invest
more than 5% of its total assets in any one investment company, or invest
more than 10% of its total assets in investment companies in general. The
Fund will invest in other investment companies primarily for the purpose
of investing short-term cash which has not yet been invested in other portfolio
instruments. Although the Adviser will waive its investment advisory fee
on that portion of the Fund's assets invested in securities of open-end
investment companies, there will still be some duplication of expenses caused
by one investment company investing in another.</P>

<P>The Fund will only purchase shares of other open-end investment companies
whose sales loads, if any, are less than 1.00% of their offering prices.</P>

<P><B>Swap Transactions</B>. As one way of managing its exposure to different
types of investments, the Fund may invest up to 5% of its net assets in
swap transactions, including interest rate and index-based swaps. See &quot;Investment
Objectives and Policies Swap Transactions&quot; in the Statement of Additional
Information.</P>

<P><B>Temporary Investments</B>. When the Adviser judges that market conditions
warrant a defensive investment position, the Fund may temporarily invest
without limit in short-term debt obligations (money market instruments).
These investments include commercial paper, bank instruments, U.S. government
obligations, repurchase agreements, and/or securities of other investment
companies. The Fund's temporary investments must be of comparable quality
to its primary investments.</P>

<P><B>U.S. Government Securities</B>. The Fund may invest in U.S. Government
Securities, which generally include direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury
(such as U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds) and obligations (including
Mortgage-Backed Securities, bonds, notes and discount notes) issued or guaranteed
by the following U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities: Federal
Home Loan Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association, Government National
Mortgage Association, Bank for Cooperatives (including Central Bank for
Cooperatives), Federal Land Banks,Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, Tennessee
Valley Authority, Export-Import Bank of the United States,Commodity Credit
Corporation, Federal Financing Bank, The Student Loan Marketing Association,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or National Credit Union Administration.
These securities are backed by: the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury;
the issuer's right to borrow an amount limited to a specific line of credit
from the U.S. Treasury; the discretionary authority of the U.S. government
to purchase certain obligations of agencies or instrumentalities; or the
credit of the agency or instrumentality issuing the obligations.</P>

<P>Examples of agencies and instrumentalities which are permissible investments
which may not always receive financial support from the U.S. government
are:Federal Farm Credit Banks; Federal Home Loan Banks; Federal National
Mortgage Association; The Student Loan Marketing Association; and Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.</P>

<P><B>When-Issued and Delayed Delivery Transactions</B>. The Fund may purchase
portfolio securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis. These transactions
are arrangements in which the Fund purchases securities with payment and
delivery scheduled for a future time. The seller's failure to complete these
transactions may cause the Fund to miss a price or yield considered to be
advantageous. Settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into
these transactions, and the market values of the securities purchased may
vary from the purchase prices. Accordingly, the Fund may pay more or less
than the market value of the securities on the settlement date.</P>

<P>The Fund may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the Adviser
deems it appropriate to do so. In addition, the Fund may enter into transactions
to sell its purchase commitments to third parties at current market values
and simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar securities
at later dates. The Fund may realize short-term profits or losses upon the
sale of such commitments.</P>

<P>ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT RISKS</P>

<P><B>Mortgage-Backed and Asset-Backed Securities</B>.Mortgage-Backed and
Asset-Backed Securities generally pay back principal and interest over the
life of the security. At the time the Fund reinvests the payments and any
unscheduled prepayments of principal received, the Fund may receive a rate
of interest which is actually lower than the rate of interest paid on these
securities (&quot;prepayment risks&quot;). Mortgage-backed and Asset-Backed
Securities are subject to higher prepayment risks than most other types
of debt instruments with prepayment risks because the underlying mortgage
loans or the collateral supporting Asset-Backed Securities may be prepaid
without penalty or premium. Prepayment risks on Mortgage-Backed Securities
tend to increase during periods of declining mortgage interest rates because
many borrowers refinance their mortgages to take advantage of the more favorable
rates. Prepayments on Mortgage-Backed Securities are also affected by other
factors, such as the frequency with which people sell their homes or elect
to make unscheduled payments on their mortgages. Although Asset-Backed Securities
generally are less likely to experience substantial prepayments than are
Mortgage-Backed Securities, certain factors that affect the rate of prepayments
on Mortgage-Backed Securities also affect the rate of prepayments on Asset-Backed
Securities.</P>

<P>While Mortgage-Backed Securities generally entail less risk of a decline
during periods of rapidly rising interest rates, Mortgage-Backed Securities
may also have less potential for capital appreciation than other similar
investments (e.g., investments with comparable maturities) because as interest
rates decline, the likelihood increases that mortgages will be prepaid.
Furthermore, if Mortgage-Backed Securities are purchased at a premium, mortgage
foreclosures and unscheduled principal payments may result in some loss
of a holder's principal investment to the extent of the premium paid. Conversely,
if Mortgage-Backed Securities are purchased at a discount, both a scheduled
payment of principal and an unscheduled pre- payment of principal would
increase current and total returns and would accelerate the recognition
of income, which would be taxed as ordinary income when distributed to shareholders.</P>

<P>Asset-Backed Securities present certain risks that are not presented
by Mortgage-Backed Securities. Primarily, these securities do not have the
benefit of the same security interest in the related collateral. Credit
card receivables are generally unsecured and the debtors are entitled to
the protection of a number of state and federal consumer credit laws, many
of which give such debtors the right to set off certain amounts owed on
the credit cards, thereby reducing the balance due. Most issuers of Asset-Backed
Securities backed by motor vehicle installment purchase obligations permit
the service of such receivables to retain possession of the underlying obligations.
If the service sells these obligations to another party, there is a risk
that the purchaser would acquire an interest superior to that of the holders
of the related Asset- Backed Securities. Further, if a vehicle is registered
in one state and is then re-registered because the owner and obligor moves
to another state, such re- registration could defeat the original security
interest in the vehicle in certain cases. In addition, because of the large
number of vehicles involved in a typical issuance and technical requirements
under state laws, the trustee for the holders of Asset-Backed Securities
backed by automobile receivables may not have a proper security interest
in all of the obligations backing such receivables. Therefore, there is
the possibility that recoveries on repossessed collateral may not, in some
cases, be available to support payments on these securities.</P>

<P><B>Stock Market</B>. As with other mutual funds that invest primarily
in equity securities, the Fund is subject to market risks. That is, the
possibility exists that common stocks will decline over short or even extended
periods of time, and the United States equity market tends to be cyclical,
experiencing both periods when stock prices generally increase and periods
when stock prices generally decrease.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>Small Capitalization Stocks</B>. However, because the Fund invests
  primarily in small capitalization stocks, there are some additional risk
  factors associated with an investment in the Fund. In particular, stocks
  in the small capitalization sector of the United States equity market have
  historically been more volatile in price than larger capitalization stocks,
  such as those included in the S&amp;P 500. This is because, among other
  things, small companies have less certain growth prospects than larger
  companies, have a lower degree of liquidity in the equity market; and tend
  to have a greater sensitivity to changing economic conditions. Further,
  in addition to exhibiting greater volatility, the stocks of small companies
  may, to some degree, fluctuate independently of the stocks of large companies.That
  is, the stocks of small companies may decline in price as the prices of
  large company stocks rise or vice versa. Therefore, investors should expect
  that the Fund, which invests primarily in small capitalization stocks,
  to be more volatile than, and may fluctuate independently of, broad stock
  market indices such as the S&amp;P 500.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Futures And Options.</B> When the Fund uses futures and options on
futures as hedging devices, there is a risk that the prices of the securities
subject to the futures contracts may not correlate with the prices of the
securities in the Fund's portfolio. This may cause the futures contract
and any related options to react differently than the portfolio securities
to market changes. In addition, the Adviser could be incorrect in its expectations
about the direction or extent of market factors such as interest or currency
exchange rate movements. In these events, the Fund may lose money on the
futures contract or option. Also, it is not certain that a secondary market
for positions in futures contracts or for options will exist at all times.Although
the Adviser will consider liquidity before entering into such transactions,
there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange or otherwise
will exist for any particular futures contract or option at any particular
time. The Fund's ability to establish and close out futures and options
positions depends on this secondary market.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Tax Information</H2>

<P>FEDERAL INCOME TAX</P>

<P>The Fund will not pay federal income tax because it expects to meet requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies
and to receive the special tax treatment afforded to such companies. The
Fund will be treated as a single, separate entity for federal income tax
purposes so that income (including capital gains) and losses realized by
the other Marshall Funds of the Corporation, if any, will not be combined
for tax purposes with those realized by any of the other Marshall Funds,
including the Fund.</P>

<P>Unless otherwise exempt, you are required to pay federal income tax on
any dividends and other distributions received, including capital gains
distributions. These tax consequences apply whether dividends are received
in cash or as additional shares. Distributions representing long-term capital
gains, if any, will be taxable to you as long-term capital gains no matter
how long you have held your shares. Information on the tax status of dividends
and distributions is provided annually.</P>

<P>STATE AND LOCAL TAXES</P>

<P>State laws differ on this issue, and you are urged to consult with your
tax adviser regarding the status of your account under state and local tax
laws, including treatment of distributions as income or return of capital.</P>

<H2><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Effect of Banking Laws</H2>

<P>M&amp;I Corp. believes, based on the advice of its counsel, that M&amp;I
Investment Management Corp. may perform the services contemplated by the
investment advisory agreement with the Corporation without violation of
the Glass-Steagall Act or other applicable banking laws or regulations.
Changes in either federal or state statutes and regulations relating to
the permissible activities of banks and their subsidiaries or affiliates,
as well as further judicial or administrative decisions or interpretations
of such present or future statutes and regulations, could prevent M&amp;I
Investment Management Corp. or M&amp;I Corp. from continuing to perform
all or a part of the above services for its customers and/or the Fund. In
such event, the Directors would consider alternative advisers and means
of continuing available investment services.</P>

<BR>
<A NAME="HTBASS"></A><B>HOW TO BUY AND SELL SHARES?</B><BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT>You may buy and sell shares of any of the Funds by telephone,
by mail or in person. All shares are both sold and redeemed at net asset
value without any sales charges. Your first purchase in any Fund must be
at least $1,000 and your later purchases must be at least $50 each. These
minimums may be waived or lowered from time to time in certain instances,
such as for M&amp;I Corp. employees. The Corporation also offers you the
privilege of exchanging shares of one Fund for another at net asset value
without any sales charge. For more information, please see &quot;How to
Buy Fund Shares,&quot; &quot;How to Redeem Fund Shares, &quot;Exchange Privilege&quot;
and &quot;Telephone Transactions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="WAIR"></A><B>WHAT ABOUT INVESTMENT RISKS?</B> <HR ALIGN=LEFT>All
mutual funds, including these Funds, take investment risks. The <B>Equity
Funds</B> must contend with the volatility and unpredictability of the U.S.
stock market. The <B>International Stock Fund</B> may experience additional
uncertainty in foreign markets and with foreign currency transactions. The
<B>Income Funds</B> invest heavily in debt securities, whose values move
in the opposite direction of prevailing interest rates and whose exposure
to market price fluctuation increases with the length of their maturities.
Some of the Funds may use options and futures contracts to hedge their investments
or increase their income, although the successful use of such investment
techniques cannot be guaranteed and may result in a loss instead. Each Fund
may invest at least some of its assets in mortgage-backed securities and
may lend its portfolio securities to other institutions. The risks associated
with these and other investments are fully explained under &quot;Portfolio
Investments and Strategies.''<BR>
<BR>
In all types of investments, reward and risk go hand in hand. If you seek
high investment returns, you must be willing to assume a comparably higher
level of risk. On the other hand, if you are comfortable with only a small
amount of risk, you should not expect a large return. Set forth below is
a risk/ reward chart that depicts the investment potential and corresponding
risks associated with different types of mutual funds. The Marshall Funds
are listed under the relevant categories.<BR>
<BR>
At the top of the chart are equity funds, which have historically produced
over the long-term a higher level of return than other types of investments,
but also have the highest potential risk. In the middle of the chart are
income funds, which offer a middle range of potential risk and return. At
the bottom of the chart are money market funds, which have a lower amount
of risk and return. As with any investment, however, past performance does
not predict future performance. Your investment return will vary, and the
redemption value of your mutual fund shares may be lower than their original
purchase price.<BR>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>The investment objective and policies of each Fund appear
below. The investment objective of a Fund cannot be changed without shareholder
approval. While a Fund cannot assure that it will achieve its investment
objective, it attempts to do so by following the investment policies described

Unless indicated otherwise, the investment policies of a Fund may be changed
by the Board of Directors (&quot;Directors'') without shareholder approval.
However, shareholders will be notified before any material change in these
policies becomes effective. For purposes of each <B>Equity Fund's</B> respective
65% investment policy, total assets shall be determined without regard to
collateral for any securities lending activity. Additional information about
investments, investment limitations and strategies, and certain investment
policies appears in the &quot;Portfolio Investments and Strategies'' section

<H4><A NAME="EF"></A>THE EQUITY FUNDS</H4>

<P><BR>
<B>Marshall Equity Income Fund</B><BR>
The investment objective of the <B>Equity Income Fund</B> is to provide
above-average dividend income with appreciation of capital. The Fund pursues
this objective by investing in a broadly diversified portfolio of common
and preferred stocks. Under normal market conditions, the Fund intends to
invest at least 65% of its total assets in equity securities that generate
dividend income. The Fund will seek to achieve dividend income at a level
of 100 basis points (or 1%) above that earned on the stocks that comprise
the S&amp;P 500. The Fund's Adviser believes it possible to achieve a dividend
level above stocks comprising the S&amp;P 500 by concentrating or overweighing
the Fund's invest- ments in stocks or sectors of the stock market that have
higher yields than the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, such as utilities,
financial institutions, and energy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Marshall Value Equity Fund<BR>
</B>The investment objective of the <B>Value Equity Fund</B> is to provide
long-term capital growth and income. The Fund pursues this objective through
the application of a value-oriented approach by investing in a broadly diversified
portfolio of common stocks, securities convertible into common stocks and
preferred stocks of medium to large capitalization companies selected on
the basis of traditional research including assessment of earnings, dividend
growth and risk/ volatility of the company's industry. Under normal market
conditions, the Fund intends to invest at least 65% of its total assets
in these equity securities. In most market conditions, the stocks comprising
the Fund's assets will exhibit traditional value characteristics such as
having a price/ earnings ratio less than the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock
Price Index (&quot;S&amp;P 500&quot;), higher than average dividend yields,
lower than average price to book value, and stocks of companies with unrecognized
or undervalued assets.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Marshall Stock Fund<BR>
</B>The investment objective of the <B>Stock Fund</B> is to provide growth
of capital and income. The Fund pursues this objective by investing primarily
in a professionally managed and diversified portfolio of common stocks of
companies with an established market and a history of stable earnings and/or
growing dividends. Under normal market conditions, the Fund intends to invest
at least 65% of its total assets in equity securities, i.e., common stocks
and preferred stocks. As a general matter, the Fund expects these investments
to generate income. The Fund's investment approach is based on the conviction
that over the long-term the economy will continue to expand and that this
economic growth will be reflected in the growth of revenues and earnings
of major corporations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Marshall Mid-Cap Stock Fund </B><BR>
The investment objective of the <B>Mid-Cap Stock Fund</B> is to seek appreciation
of capital. The Fund will pursue this objective by investing, under normal
market conditions, at least 65% of its total assets in common and preferred
stocks issued by medium-sized companies whose market capitalizations generally
range from $200 million to $7.5 billion. The Fund's Adviser will invest
primarily in equity securities of companies with above-average earnings
growth prospects or in companies where significant fundamental changes are
taking place. These changes could include significant new products, services,
or methods of distribution; restructuring or reallocating business; or significant
share price appreciation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Marshall International Stock Fund<BR>
</B>The investment objective of the <B>International Stock Fund</B> is long-term
capital growth. The Fund pursues this objective through a flexible policy
of investing in stocks and debt obligations of companies and governments
outside the United States. Under normal market conditions, at least 65%
of the Fund's total assets will be invested in securities of issuers domi-
ciled in at least three different nations outside the United States, and
at least 65% of the Fund's total assets will be invested in equity securities,<I>
i.e.</I>, common stocks and preferred stocks. The Fund may also invest up
to 35% of its total assets in debt securities, warrants or rights to subscribe
to or purchase equity securities, or securities convertible into common
or preferred stocks when, in the judgment of the Fund's Subadviser, the
capital appreciation available through such investments outweigh the potential
for capital growth through investment in equity securities. Certain debt
securities can provide the potential for capital appreciation based on various
factors such as changes in interest rates, economic and market conditions,
improvement in an issuer's ability to repay principal and pay interest,
and ratings upgrades. The Fund may invest in debt or preferred securities
which have equity features, such as conversion or exchange rights, or which
carry warrants to purchase common stock or other equity interests. Such
equity features enable the holder of the bond or preferred security to benefit
from increases in the market price of the underlying equity security. Any
income realized by the Fund will be incidental to its investment objective
of long-term capital growth. In selecting securities, the Fund's Subadviser
attempts to identify those companies in various countries and industries
where economic and political factors, including currency movements, are
likely to produce above-average opportunities for capital appreciation.<BR>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="NAV"></A>NET ASSET VALUE</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Shares of a Fund are sold at their share price, which
is the net asset value without any sales charge, next determined after your
order is received. The net asset value is determined for the <B>Money Market
Fund </B>at 12:00 p.m. (Central Time) and 3:00 p.m. (Central Time), and
for all other Funds at or after the close of the New York Stock Exchange,
Monday through Friday, except on: (i) days on which there are not sufficient
changes in the value of a Fund's portfolio securities that its net asset
value might be materially affected; (ii) days during which no shares are
tendered for redemption and no orders to purchase shares are received; and
(iii) the following holidays: New Year's Day, Presidents' Day, Good Friday,
Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas
Day.<BR>
Each Fund's share price fluctuates, except that the <B>Money Market Fund</B>
attempts to maintain a stable $1 share price, although this cannot be guaranteed.
The net asset value of many of the Funds are listed daily in your newspaper's
mutual fund quotations section under the bold heading &quot;<B>Marshall
Funds.</B>'' A Fund's net asset value is determined by adding the market
value of all portfolio securities and other assets, subtracting liabilities,
and dividing by the number of outstanding shares. Like most other money
market funds, the <B>Money Market Fund</B> uses the amortized cost method
to value its portfolio securities in order to help maintain a stable $1
share price.</P>

<H2><A NAME="HTRS"></A>How to Redeem Shares</H2>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>You may redeem your Fund shares at their net asset value

Asset Value&quot; above. Telephone or written requests for redemptions must
be received in proper form as described below and can be made through MFIS

<H3><A NAME="AC"></A>ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Signature Guarantees.</B> In the following instances,
you must have a signature guarantee on written redemption requests:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>when you are requesting a redemption of $50,000 or more;
  <LI>when you want a redemption to be sent to an address other than the
  one you have on record with the Fund;
  <LI>or when you want the redemption payable to someone other than the shareholder
  of record.
</UL>

<P>Notaries do not guarantee signatures. A notary public seal is not an
acceptable replacement for a signature guarantee. Instead, the signatures
must be guaranteed by:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>a trust company or commercial bank whose deposits are insured by the
  Bank Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance
  Corporation (&quot;FDIC&quot;);
  <LI>a member of the New York, American, Boston, Midwest, or Pacific Stock
  Exchange;
  <LI>a savings bank or savings and loan association whose deposits are insured
  by the Savings Association Insurance Fund, which is administered by the
  FDIC; or
  <LI>any other &quot;eligible guarantor institution,&quot; as defined in
  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
</UL>

<P>The Corporation and its transfer agent have adopted standards for accepting
signature guarantees from the above institutions. The Corporation may elect
in the future to limit eligible signature guarantors to institutions that
are members of a signature guarantee program. The Corporation and its transfer
agent reserve the right to amend these standards at any time without notice.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Redemption Before Purchase Instruments Clear.</B> When you purchase Fund
shares by check or through the Automated Clearing House system, the proceeds
from the redemption of those shares (whether redeemed by mail, by telephone
or by checkwriting) are not available, and the shares may not be exchanged,
until MFIS is reasonably certain that the purchase check has cleared, which
could take up to seven calendar days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Accounts With Low Balances. </B>Due to the high cost of maintaining accounts
with low balances, a Fund may redeem shares in your account and pay you
the proceeds if your account balance falls below the required minimum value
of $1,000.<BR>
<BR>
Before shares are redeemed to close an account, you will be notified in
writing and allowed 30 days to purchase additional shares to meet the minimum
account balance requirement.</P>

<H2><A NAME="EP"></A>Exchange Privilege</H2>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>You may exchange shares of a Fund for shares of any of
the other Funds at net asset value without a sales charge, provided you
meet the investment minimum of the Fund. The exchange privilege is available
to shareholders residing in any state in which the Fund shares you are acquiring
may legally be sold.<BR>
<BR>
Upon receipt of proper instructions and all necessary supporting documents,
the Fund shares you submit for exchange will be redeemed at the next-determined
net asset value. Written exchange instructions may require a signature guarantee.
See &quot;Signature Guarantees&quot; above. An exchange is treated as a
sale for federal income tax purposes and, depending on the circumstances,
you may realize a short or long-term capital gain or loss. The exchange
privilege may be terminated at any time, and you will be notified of such
termination. You may obtain further information on the exchange privilege
by calling MFIS.<BR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="TT"></A>Telephone Transactions</H2>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>If you have completed a telephone authorization section
in your account application or have completed an authorization form obtained
through MFIS or M&amp;I Brokerage Services, you may telephone instructions
to MFIS to redeem Fund shares or to request a purchase of Fund shares by
exchanging between Fund accounts that have identical shareholder registrations.
Trust customers should contact their account officer. Telephone exchange
instructions must<BR>
be received before 3:00 p.m. (Central Time) for shares to be exchanged the
same day. However, you will not receive a dividend of the Fund into which
you exchange on the date of the exchange. Telephone redemption requests
are subject to the time requirements explained above in &quot;How to Redeem
Fund Shares.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Shares held in certificate form cannot be exchanged or redeemed by telephone.
Instead, you must forward the certificates to the transfer agent through
MFIS for credit to your mutual fund account before they can be exchanged
or redeemed.<BR>
<BR>
Shareholders requesting a telephone exchange or redemption service authorize
a Fund and its agents to act upon their telephonic instructions to exchange
or redeem shares from any account for which they have authorized such services.
Telephone instructions may be recorded. If reasonable procedures are not
followed by the Funds, they may be liable for losses due to unauthorized
or fraudulent telephone instructions.<BR>
<BR>
The telephone privileges may be modified or terminated at any time. You
will be notified of such modification or termination. During times of drastic
economic or market changes, you may experience difficulty in making exchanges
or redemptions by telephone through banks, brokers, and other financial
institutions. In such cases, you should make the exchange or redemption
request in writing and send it by overnight mail.</P>

<H2><A NAME="MFII"></A>Marshall Funds, Inc. Information</H2>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="OAH"></A>ORGANIZATION AND HISTORY</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>The Corporation was incorporated under the laws of Wisconsin
on July 31, 1992. The Corporation may offer separate series of shares representing
interests in separate portfolios of securities, and the shares in any one
portfolio may be offered in separate classes.</P>

<H3><A NAME="M"></A>MANAGEMENT</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Board of Directors. </B>The Directors are responsible
for managing the business affairs of the Corporation and for exercising
all of the powers of the Corporation except those reserved for the shareholders.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Investment Adviser and Subadviser.</B> Pursuant to an investment advisory
contract with the Corporation, M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. serves
as the investment adviser (the &quot;Adviser&quot;) to each Fund, subject
to direction by the Directors. With respect to the <B>International Stock
Fund</B>, the Adviser has entered into a Subadvisory Contract with Templeton
Investment Counsel, Inc. (&quot;TICI&quot; or &quot;Subadviser&quot;), which
gives TICI complete discretion to purchase, manage and sell portfolio securities
for the <B>International Stock Fund</B>, subject to the Fund's investment
objective, policies and limitations. Although the Corporation's Directors
and officers, and the Adviser do not evaluate the investment merits of TICI's
individual security selections, TICI's activities are subject to their oversight.<BR>
<BR>
Both the Corporation and the Adviser have adopted strict codes of ethics
governing the conduct of all employees who manage the Corporation and its
portfolio securities. These codes recognize that such persons owe a fiduciary
duty to the Corporation's shareholders and must place the interests of shareholders
ahead of the employees' own interest. Among other things, the codes: require
preclearance and periodic reporting of personal securities transactions;
prohibit personal transactions in securities being purchased or sold, or
being considered for purchase or sale, by the Corporation; prohibit purchasing
securities in initial public offering; and prohibit taking profits or securities
held for less than sixty days. Violations of the codes are subject to review
by the Board of Directors, and could result in severe penalties.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Advisory Fees</B>. The Adviser is entitled to receive an annual investment
advisory fee equal to a percentage of each Fund's average daily net assets
as follows: 0.50% of <B>Money Market Fund</B> and <B>Short-Term Tax-Free
Fund</B>; 0.60% of <B>Short-Term Income Fund</B>, <B>Intermediate Bond Fund</B>
and <B>Intermediate Tax-Free Fund</B>; 0.75% of <B>Government Income Fund</B>,
<B>Stock Fund</B>, <B>Value Equity Fund</B>, <B>Equity Income Fund</B> and
<B>Mid-Cap Stock Fund</B>; and 1.00% of <B>International Stock Fund</B>.
Out of the fee paid by the <B>International Stock Fund</B> to the Adviser,
TICI is entitled to receive an annual fee equal to 0.50% of the <B>International
Stock Fund's</B> daily net assets up to $70 million and 0.40% of such assets
in excess thereof. The fees of 0.75 of 1% or more may be higher than the
advisory fees paid by mutual funds in general but is comparable to the fee
paid by many mutual funds with objectives and policies similar to the Funds.
The investment advisory contract allows the voluntary waiver in whole or
in part of the investment advisory fees or the reimbursement of expenses
by the Adviser from time to time. The Adviser can terminate any voluntary
waiver of its fees or reimbursement of expenses at any time in its sole
discretion.<BR>
<BR>
Investment decisions for the Funds will be made independently from those
of any fiduciary or other accounts that may be managed by the Adviser, Subadviser
or their affiliates. If, however, such accounts, a Fund, or the Adviser
or Subadviser for its own account, are simultaneously engaged in transactions
involving the same securities, the transactions may be combined and allocated
to each account. Although this system may adversely affect the price the
Funds pay or receive, or the size of the position they obtain, it may also
enable the Funds to benefit from lower transaction costs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Adviser's Background.</B> M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. is a registered
investment adviser and a wholly owned subsidiary of Marshall &amp; Ilsley
Corp., a registered bank holding company headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
As of December 1, 1995, M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. had approximately

managed the Corporation's portfolios since 1992, and managed the Newton
Funds (predecessors to certain of these portfolios) since 1985. As part
of its regular banking operations, affiliates of the Adviser may make loans
to public companies. Thus, it may be possible, from time to time, for the
Funds to hold or acquire securities of issuers which are also lending clients
of the Adviser's affiliates. The lending relationship will not be a factor
in the selection of securities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Subadviser's Background.</B> TICI is a registered investment adviser
and a professional investment counseling firm which has been handling investment
services since 1979. As of December 1, 1995, TICI had discretionary investment

Resources, Inc., which engages in various aspects of the financial services
industry through its subsidiaries.<BR>
TICI and its affiliates serve as advisers for a wide variety of mutual funds
and private clients in many nations. TICI, its affiliates and their predecessors
have been investing globally over the past 52 years and provide investment
management and advisory services to a worldwide client base, including over
3.0 million mutual fund shareholders, foundations and endowments, employee
benefit plans and individuals. TICI and its affiliates have approximately
3,200 employees in ten different countries and a global network of over
50 investment research sources. TICI is supported by the Templeton organization's
large staff of research analysts, traders and other investment specialists
based in Fort Lauderdale, Nassau, New York, Edinburgh, Toronto, Hong Kong,
Melbourne, and Singapore. Templeton's research analysts use a disciplined,
long-term approach to value-oriented global and international investing.
Securities are selected for the <B>International Stock Fund's</B> portfolio
from a list of eligible securities maintained and constantly updated by
Templeton's analysts on the basis of fundamental analysis, which utilizes
a global database of information on issuers. TICI believes that the Templeton

<H3><A NAME="DOFS"></A>DISTRIBUTION OF FUND SHARES</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Federated Securities Corp., a subsidiary of Federated
Investors, is the principal distributor for shares of the Funds and a number
of other investment companies. The distributor may offer certain items of
nominal value from time to time to any shareholder or investor in connection
with the sale of Fund shares.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Administrative Arrangements.</B> The distributor may select brokers,
dealers and administrators (including depository or other institutions such
as commercial banks and savings and loan associations) to provide distribution
and/or administrative services for which they will receive fees from the
distributor based upon shares owned by their clients or customers. These
administrative services include distributing prospectuses and other information,
providing account assistance, and communicating or facilitating purchases
and redemptions of the Funds' shares. The fees are calculated as a percentage
of the average aggregate net asset value of shareholder accounts held during
the period for which the brokers, dealers, and administrators provide services.
Any fees paid for these services by the distributor will be reimbursed by
the Adviser and not the Funds.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Distribution Plan.</B> Under a Rule 12b-1 Plan (the &quot;Plan&quot;),
the <B>Money Market Fund</B> will pay to the distributor on behalf of <B>Class
B Shares</B> an amount computed at an annual rate of 0.30 of 1% of the average
daily net asset value of <B>Class B Shares,</B> and <B>International Stock
Fund</B> may pay the distributor an amount computed at an annual rate of
0.25% of the <B>International Stock Fund's</B> average daily net assets,
in each case to finance any activity which is principally intended to result
in the sale of the shares subject to the Plan (&quot;Plan Shares&quot;).
The <B>International Stock Fund</B> has no present intention of paying or
accruing 12b-1 fees during the fiscal year ending August 31, 1996. The distributor
may, from time to time and for such periods as it deems appropriate, voluntarily
reduce its compensation under the Plan.<BR>
<BR>
The distributor may select certain entities to provide sales and/or administrative
services as agents for holders of Plan Shares. Administrative services may
include, but are not limited to, the following functions: providing office
space, equipment, telephone facilities, and various clerical, supervisory,
computer, and other personnel as necessary or beneficial to establish and
maintain shareholder accounts and records; processing purchase and redemption
transactions and automatic investments of client account cash balances;
answering routine client inquiries regarding Plan Shares; assisting clients
in changing dividend options, account designations, and addresses; and providing
such other services as these Funds reasonably request. Such entities will
receive fees from the distributor based upon Plan Shares owned by their
clients or customers. The schedules of such fees and the basis upon which
such fees will be paid will be determined from time to time by the distributor.<BR>
<BR>
The Funds' Plan is a compensation type plan. As such, the Funds make no
payments to the distributor except as described above. Therefore, the Funds
do not pay for unreimbursed expenses of the distributor, including amounts
expended by the distributor in excess of amounts received by it from the
Funds, interest, carrying or other financing charges in connection with
excess amounts expended, or the distributor's overhead expenses. However,
the distributor may be able to recover such amounts or may earn a profit
from future payments made by the Funds under the Plan.<BR>
<BR>
The Glass-Steagall Act prohibits a depository institution (such as a commercial
bank or a savings and loan association) from being an underwriter or distributor
of most securities. In the event the Glass-Steagall Act is deemed to prohibit
depository institutions from acting in the administrative capacities described
above or should Congress relax current restrictions on depository institutions,
the Directors will consider appropriate changes in the services.<BR>
<BR>
State securities laws governing the ability of depository institutions to
act as underwriters or distributors of securities may differ from interpretations
given to the Glass-Steagall Act and, therefore, banks and financial institutions
may be required to register as dealers pursuant to state law. In addition,
some state securities laws may require administrators to register as brokers
and dealers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Other Payments to Financial Institutions.</B> The distributor, the Adviser
or their affiliates, at their own expense and out of their own assets, may
also provide other compensation to institutions in connection with sales
of Fund shares or as financial assistance for providing substantial marketing,
sales and operational support. The support may include initiating customer
accounts, providing sales literature, or participating in sales, educational
and training seminars (including those held at recreational facilities).
Such assistance will be predicated upon the amount of shares of the Fund
or the Corporation the institution sells or may sell and/or upon the type
and nature of sales, operational or marketing support furnished by the institution.
Any payments made by the distributor may be reimbursed by the Adviser or

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Administrative Services.</B> Federated Administrative

<P>The administrative fee received during any fiscal year shall be at least

is the shareholder servicing agent for the Funds. As such, MFIS provides
shareholder services which include, but are not limited to, distributing
prospectuses and other information, providing shareholder assistance, and
communicating or facilitating purchases and redemptions of shares. Each
Fund may pay MFIS a fee equal to approximately 0.02 of 1% of the average
daily net asset value of Fund shares for which MFIS provides shareholder
services. MFIS may voluntarily choose to waive all or a portion of its fee
at any time.</P>

<H3><A NAME="BT"></A>BROKERAGE TRANSACTIONS</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>When selecting brokers and dealers to handle the purchase
and sale of portfolio instruments, the Adviser and TICI look for prompt
execution of the order at a favorable price. In working with dealers, the
Adviser and TICI will generally utilize those who are recognized dealers
in specific portfolio instruments, except when a better price and execution
of the order can be obtained elsewhere. In selecting among firms believed
to meet these criteria, the Adviser and TICI may give consideration to those
firms which have sold or are selling shares of the Funds and other funds
distributed by Federated Securities Corp. or Franklin/ Templeton Distributors,
Inc. The Adviser and TICI make decisions on portfolio transactions and select
brokers and dealers subject to review by the Directors.</P>

<H3><A NAME="EOTF"></A>EXPENSES OF THE FUNDS</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Each Fund pays all of its own expenses and its allocable
share of the Corporation's expenses. These expenses include, but are not
limited to, the cost of: organizing the Corporation and continuing its existence;
Director's fees; investment advisory and administrative services; printing
prospectuses and other Fund documents for shareholders; registering the
Corporation, the Funds, and shares of each Fund with federal and state securities
authorities; taxes and commissions; issuing, purchasing, repurchasing, and
redeeming shares; fees for custodians, transfer agents, dividend disbursing
agents, shareholder servicing agents, and registrars; printing, mailing,
auditing, and certain accounting and legal expenses; reports to shareholders;
meetings of Directors and shareholders and proxy solicitations therefor;
insurance premiums; association membership dues; and such non-recurring
and extraordinary items as may arise. However, the Adviser may voluntarily
reimburse some expenses and, in addition, has undertaken to reimburse each
Fund up to the amount of its advisory fee, the amount by which operating
expenses exceed limitations imposed by certain states.</P>

<H2><A NAME="SI"></A>SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION</H2>

<H3><HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="CAC"></A>CERTIFICATES AND CONFIRMATIONS</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>As transfer agent for the Funds, Federated Services Company
maintains a share account for each shareholder of record. Upon written request,
you can receive share certificates without charge, but only for whole shares
of a Fund. You may contact MFIS to direct the transfer agent to issue you
certificates or deliver certificates for redemption or credit to your account.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>Money Market Fund</B> sends you monthly confirmations to report all
transactions such as purchases, redemptions, and dividends paid during the
month. The other Funds send you a detailed confirmation of each purchase
or redemption or dividend payment. At a minimum, you will receive a monthly
statement. You may request photocopies of confirmations for transactions
affecting your account in prior years at a fee of $5 per year per Fund to
cover the cost of obtaining this information.</P>

<H4><A NAME="DACG"></A>DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS</H4>

<P>Dividends of the <B>Money Market Fund</B>, <B>Income Funds</B> and <B>Tax-Free
Income Funds</B> are declared daily and paid monthly. Dividends of the <B>Equity
Funds</B> are declared and paid quarterly, except for the <B>International
Stock Fund</B>, which declares and pays dividends annually. Only shareholders
invested in the particular Fund on the record date of the dividend declaration
are paid that dividend. Capital gains, when realized by a Fund, will be
distributed at least once every 12 months. Unless you request cash payments
by writing to your Fund, your dividends and capital gains are automatically
reinvested in additional shares of the respective Fund on payment dates
at the ex-dividend date net asset value.</P>

<H4><A NAME="CSAVR"></A>COMMON STOCK AND VOTING RIGHTS</H4>

<P>The Directors have authorized the issuance of shares of Common Stock
representing ownership interests in each of the Funds. Shareholders are
entitled to one vote for each full share of Common Stock and proportionate
fractional votes for fractional shares. All shares of each Fund or class
in the Corporation have equal voting rights and will generally vote in the
aggregate and not by Fund or class, unless required by law. For example,
only shares of a particular Fund or class are entitled to vote on matters
affecting that Fund or class. Voting rights are not cumulative; consequently,
the holders of more than 50% of the Corporation's shares of Common Stock
can elect the entire Board of Directors.<BR>
<BR>
The Corporation does not intend to hold annual meetings of shareholders,
unless required by the Act or applicable law. Directors may be removed by
the shareholders at a special meeting, which may be called by the Directors
upon written request of shareholders owning at least 10% of the Corporation's
outstanding voting shares.<BR>
<BR>

<P><B>Supplement to Combined Prospectus dated December 31, 1995</B></P>

<P>The following information is a supplement to your combined prospectus.
We're providing it to advise you of a change in the shareholder servicing
agent and the shareholder servicing fee for all of the Marshall Funds(except
for the <B>Money Market Fund</B>, for which there are no changes). These
changes will be implemented on or about September 3, 1996.</P>

<P>I. Please replace the Summary of Fund Expenses table on page 5 with the
following Summary of Fund Expenses table:</P>

<H1>Summary of Fund Expenses <HR ALIGN=LEFT><IMG SRC="prographics/pfigure1.gif"
WIDTH="590" HEIGHT="346" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></H1>

<P>(1) The management fee has been reduced to reflect the voluntary waiver
by the investment adviser for all of the Funds except the Value Equity Fund.
The adviser may terminate this voluntary waiver at any time at its sole
discretion. The maximum management fee is 0.75% for the Stock Fund, Equity
Income Fund, Mid-Cap Stock Fund and Government Income Fund; 1.00% for the
International Stock Fund; 0.60% for the Short-Term Income Fund, Intermediate
Bond Fund and Intermediate Tax-Free Fund; and 0.50% for the Short-Term Tax-Free
Fund and Money Market Fund--Class A and Class B Shares.</P>

<P>(2) The International Stock Fund has no present intention of paying or
accruing 12b-1 fees during the fiscal year ending August 31, 1996. If the
International Stock Fund were paying or accruing 12b-1 fees, the International
Stock Fund would be able to pay up to 0.25% of its average daily net assets
for 12b-1 fees. See ''Marshall Funds, Inc. Information.''</P>

<P>(3) Total Other Expenses were 0.79% for the Short-Term Tax-Free Fund
absent the voluntary expense reimbursement by the adviser and the voluntary
waiver by the administrator and 0.47% for the Intermediate Tax-Free Fund
absent the voluntary waiver by the administrator. The administrator and
adviser may terminate this waiver and reimbursement at any time at their
sole discretion.</P>

<P>(4) The Shareholder Servicing Fee for Short-Term Income Fund, Intermediate
Bond Fund, Government Income Fund, Short-Term Tax-Free Fund and Intermediate
Bond Fund has been reduced to reflect a voluntary waiver by the shareholder
servicing agent. The shareholder servicing agent may terminate this waiver
at any time at its sole discretion. The maximum Shareholder Servicing Fee
is 0.25% for all funds except Money Market Fund--Class A and Class B, which
has a 0.02% maximum for each class.</P>

<P>(5) Total Fund Operating Expenses are expected to be 0.98% for the Equity
Income Fund, 0.97% for the Stock Fund, 1.01% for the Mid-Cap Stock Fund,
1.34% for the International Stock Fund, 0.51% for the Short-Term Income
Fund, 0.72% for the Intermediate Bond Fund, 0.86% for the Government Income
Fund, 0.51% for the Short-Term Tax-Free Fund, 0.61% for the Intermediate
Tax-Free Fund, 0.41% for the Money Market Fund--Class A Shares and 0.71%
for the Money Market Fund--Class B Shares for the fiscal year ending August
31, 1996. The expenses in the table above reflect a change in the shareholder
servicing fee effective on or about September 3, 1996. Total Fund Operating
expenses are expected to be 1.33% for the Equity Income Fund, 1.22% for
the Stock Fund, 1.32% for the Mid-Cap Stock Fund, 1.81% for the International
Stock Fund, 1.14% for the Short-Term Income Fund, 1.02% for the Intermediate
Bond Fund, 1.35% for the Government Income Fund, 1.52% for the Short-Term
Tax-Free Fund, 1.30% for the Intermediate Tax-Free Fund, 0.67% for the Money
Market Fund--Class A Shares, and 0.97% for the Money Market Fund--Class
B Shares for the fiscal year ending August 31, 1997, absent the voluntary
waivers described in Notes 1, 3 and 4.</P>

<P>The purpose of this table is to assist an investor in understanding the
various costs and expenses that a shareholder of the Funds will bear either
directly or indirectly. For more complete descriptions of the various costs
and expenses, see ''Marshall Funds, Inc. Information'' Wire-transferred
redemptions may be subject to an additional fee.</P>

<P>Long-term shareholders invested in the Money Market Fund--Class B Shares
may pay more than the economic equivalent of the maximum front-end sales
charges permitted under the rules of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (''NASD''). However, in order for a Class B Shareholder to
exceed the NASD's maximum front-end sales charge of 6.25%, a continuous
investment in the Class B Shares for 89.3 years would be required.</P>

<P><B>EXAMPLE<BR>
</B>You would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 Investment assuming
(1) 5% annual return and (2) redemption at the end of each time period.
The Funds charge no redemption fees.</P>

<H5>The above example should not be considered a representation of past
or future expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown.</H5>

<P>II. On or about September 3, 1996, Federated Shareholder Services Company
will replace Marshall Funds Investor Services as shareholder servicing agent
to all of the Marshall Funds, except for the <B>Money Market Fund</B>. In
connection with this change, please replace the paragraph entitled ''Shareholder
Servicing Arrangements'' under the section ''Administration of the Funds''
on page 19 with the following:</P>

<P><B>''Shareholder Servicing Arrangements</B>. Federated Shareholder Services
Company (''FSSC'') has been appointed shareholder servicing agent for the
<B>Equity Funds</B> and the <B>Income Funds</B>. As such, FSSC provides
shareholder services which include, but are not limited to, distributing
prospectuses and other information, providing shareholder assistance, and
communicating or facilitating purchases and redemptions of shares. The <B>Equity
Funds</B> and the <B>Income Funds</B> may pay FSSC a fee equal to approximately
0.25 of 1% of the average daily net asset value of Fund shares for which
FSSC provides shareholder services. FSSC may hire third parties, including
Marshall Funds Investor Services, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a division of M&amp;I
Trust Company(''MFIS''), to provide shareholder services to the <B>Equity
Funds</B> and the <B>Income Funds</B>.</P>

<P>MFIS is the shareholder servicing agent for the <B>Money Market Fund</B>.
As such, MFIS provides shareholder services which include, but are not limited
to, distributing prospectuses and other information, providing shareholder
assistance, and communicating or facilitating purchases and redemptions
of shares. The <B>Money Market Fund</B> may pay MFIS a fee equal to approximately
0.02 of 1% of the average daily net asset value of Fund shares for which
MFIS provides shareholder services. MFIS may voluntarily choose to waive
all or a portion of its fee at any time.''</P>

<H2><A NAME="PI"></A>PERFORMANCE INFORMATION</H2>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>From time to time, all of the Funds may advertise total
return and yield, the <B>Money Market Fund</B> may advertise its effective
yield, and the <B>Tax-Free Income Funds</B> may advertise their tax-equivalent
yields.<BR>
<BR>
Total return represents the change, over a specified period of time, in
the value of an investment in a Fund after reinvesting all income and capital
gains distribu- tions. It is calculated by dividing that change by the initial
investment and is expressed as a percentage.<BR>
<BR>
The yield for the <B>Money Market Fund</B> represents the annualized rate
of income earned on an investment in its shares over a seven-day period.
It is the annualized dividends earned during the period on the investment,
shown as a percentage of the investment. The effective yield is calculated
similarly to the yield, but, when annualized, the income earned by an investment
is assumed to be reinvested daily. The effective yield will be slightly
higher than the yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed
reinvestment. The <B>Class A Shares</B> and <B>Class B Shares</B> of the
<B>Money Market Fund</B> will each have their own yields. Because <B>Class
A Shares</B> are not subject to 12b-1 fees, their yields will be higher
than yields of <B>Class B Shares</B>.<BR>
<BR>
The yield for the other Funds is calculated by dividing the net investment
income per share (as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission)
earned by a Fund over a thirty-day period by the offering price per share
of the Fund on the last day of the period. This number is then annualized
using semi-annual compounding. The tax-equivalent yield is calculated similarly
to the yield, but is adjusted to reflect the taxable yield that a <B>Tax-Free
Income Fund</B> would have had to earn to equal its actual yield, assuming
a specific tax rate. The yield and the tax-equivalent yield do not necessarily
reflect income actually earned by a Fund and, therefore, may not correlate
to the dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders.<BR>
<BR>
From time to time, the Funds may advertise their performance using certain
reporting services and/or compare their performance to certain indices.</P>

<H2><A NAME="PIAS"></A>PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIES</H2>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Asset-Backed Securities.</B> The <B>Equity Funds</B>
and the <B>Income Funds</B> may invest in Asset-Backed Securities rated,
at the time of purchase, in the top three rating categories by an NRSRO
(A or better by S&amp;P, Fitch or Moody's) or, if unrated, of comparable
quality as determined by the Fund's Adviser or Subadviser. The <B>Money
Market Fund</B> may invest in short-term tranches of Asset Backed-Securities
that meet the rating and maturity requirements of Rule 2a-7. However, only
the <B>Income Funds</B> expect that they might exceed 5% of their respective
net assets in these securities. Asset-Backed Securities have structural
characteristics similar to Mortgage-Backed Securities but have underlying
assets that generally are not mortgage loans or interests in mortgage loans.
The Funds may invest in Asset-Backed Securities including, but not limited
to, interests in pools of receivables, such as motor vehicle installment
purchase obligations and credit card receivables, equipment leases, manufactured
housing (mobile home) leases, or home equity loans. These securities may
be in the form of pass-through instruments or asset-backed bonds. The securities
are issued by non-governmental entities and carry no direct or indirect
government guarantee.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Bank Instruments.</B> The Funds may invest in domestic Bank Instruments,
which are instruments (including time and savings deposits, bankers' acceptances
and certificates of deposit) of banks and savings and loans that have capital,
surplus and undivided profits of over $100 million or for which the principal
amount of the instrument is insured by the Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings
Association Insurance Fund, which are administered by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. The <B>International Stock Fund</B>, the <B>Money
Market Fund</B>, and to a limited extent the other <B>Equity Funds</B> may
purchase foreign Bank Instru- ments, which include Eurodollar Certificates
of Deposit (&quot;ECDs''), Yankee Certificates of Deposit (&quot;Yankee
CDs'') and Eurodollar Time Deposits (&quot;ETDs''). ECDs are U.S. dollar-denominated
certifi- cates of deposits issued by foreign branches of U.S. banks or foreign
banks. Yankee CDs are U.S. dollar denominated certificates of deposits issued
in the U.S. by branches and agencies of foreign banks. ETDs are U.S. dollar-denominated
deposits in foreign branches of U.S. banks or foreign banks. The <B>Income
Funds</B> and the <B>Tax-Free Income Funds</B> reserve the right to invest
in foreign Bank Instruments, although they do not presently intend to so
invest. The Funds will treat securities credit-enhanced with a bank's irrevocable
letter of credit or unconditional guaranty as Bank Instruments.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Borrowing.</B> While each of the Funds is permitted as a fundamental
investment policy to borrow money from banks or through reverse repurchase
agreements (arrangements in which a Fund sells a portfolio instrument for
a percentage of its cash value with an agreement to buy it back on a set
date) in amounts of up to one-third of its total assets (&quot;net'' assets
for the <B>Money Market Fund</B>, <B>Short-Term Income Fund</B> and <B>Intermediate
Bond Fund</B>), and pledge some assets as collateral, only the <B>International
Stock Fund</B> expects that it might exceed 5%. This is because the <B>International
Stock Fund</B>, unlike the other Funds, may borrow money to purchase some
of its portfolio securities, i.e., it may use &quot;leverage.'' Leveraging
tends to exaggerate the effect on the Fund's net asset value of changes
in the value of its portfolio securities. Also, the Fund must pay interest
on borrowed money and may incur other costs, and these expenses could exceed
the income received or capital appreciation realized by the Fund from the
securities it purchases with borrowed money.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Convertible Securities. </B>The <B>Equity Funds</B> may invest in convertible
securities which are rated, at the time of purchase, investment grade by
an NRSRO (such as BBB or better by S&amp;P or Fitch, or Baa or better by
Moody's), or, if unrated, are of comparable quality as determined by the
Fund's Adviser or Subadviser. Convertible securities are fixed income securities
which may be exchanged or converted into a predetermined number of the issuer's
underlying common stock at the option of the holder during a specified time
period. Convertible securities may take the form of convertible bonds, convertible
preferred stock or debentures, units consisting of &quot;usable'' bonds
and warrants or a combination of the features of several of these securities.
The investment characteristics of each convertible security vary widely,
which allows convertible securities to be employed for diferent investment
objectives. In selecting a convertible security, the Fund's Adviser or Subadviser
evaluates the investment characteristics of the convertible security as
a fixed income instrument, and the investment potential of the underlying
security for capital appreciation.<BR>
<BR>
Convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks generally retain the
investment characteristics of fixed income securities until they have been
converted but also react to movements in the underlying equity securities.
The holder is entitled to receive the fixed income of a bond or the dividend
preference of a preferred stock until the holder elects to exercise the
conversion privilege. Usable bonds are corporate bonds that can be used
in whole or in part, customa- rily at full face value, in lieu of cash to
purchase the issuer's common stock. Convertible securities are senior to
equity securities, and therefore have a claim to assets of the corporation
prior to the holders of common stock in the case of liquidation. However,
convertible securities are generally subordinated to similar nonconvertible
securities of the same company. The interest income and dividends from convertible
bonds and preferred stocks provide a stable stream of income with generally
higher yields than common stocks, but lower than nonconvertible securities
of similar quality. A Fund will exchange or convert the convertible securities
held in its portfolio into shares of the underlying common stocks when,
in the opinion of the Fund's Adviser or Subadviser, the investment characteristics
of the underlying common shares will assist the Fund in achieving its investment
objective. Otherwise, the Fund will hold or trade the convertible securities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Credit Enhancement</B>. Certain of a Fund's acceptable investments may
have been credit-enhanced by a guaranty, letter of credit or insurance.
The Funds typically evaluate the credit quality and ratings of credit-enhanced
securities based upon the financial condition and ratings of the party providing
the credit enhancement (the &quot;credit enhancer''), rather than the issuer.
However, credit-enhanced securities will not be treated as having been issued
by the credit enhancer for diversification purposes, unless the Fund has
invested more than 10% of its assets in securities issued, guaranteed or
otherwise credit-enhanced by the credit enhancer, in which case the securities
will be treated as having been issued both by the issuer and the credit
enhancer. The bankruptcy, receivership or default of the credit enhancer
will adversely affect the quality and marketability of the underlying security.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Demand Features.</B> Each of the Funds may acquire securities that are
subject to puts and standby commitments (&quot;demand features'') to purchase
the securities at their principal amount (usually with accrued interest)
within a fixed period (usually seven days following a demand by the Funds).
The demand feature may be issued by the issuer of the underlying securities,
a dealer in the securities or by another third party, and may not be transferred
separately from the underlying security. A Fund uses these arrangements
to provide it with liquidity and not to protect against changes in the market
value of the underlying securities. The bankruptcy, receivership or default
by the issuer of the demand feature, or a default on the underlying security
or other event that terminates the demand feature before its exercise, will
adversely affect the liquidity of the underlying security. Demand features
that are exercisable even after a payment default on the underlying security
may be treated as a form of credit enhancement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Demand Master Notes.</B> <B>The Short-Term Income Fund, Intermediate
Bond Fund and Money Market Fund</B> may invest in variable amount demand
master notes. Demand notes are short-term borrowing arrangements between
a corporation or government agency and an institutional lender (such as
the Funds) payable upon demand by either party. The notice period for demand
typically ranges from one to seven days, and the party may demand full or
partial payment. Many master notes give the Funds the option of increasing
or decreasing the principal amount of the master note on a daily or weekly
basis within certain limits. Demand master notes usually provide for floating
or variable rates of interest.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Depositary Receipts.</B> The <B>International Stock Fund</B> may invest
in foreign issuers by purchasing sponsored or unsponsored ADRs, GDRs and
EDRs (collective, &quot;Depositary Receipts''). The other <B>Equity Funds</B>
may invest only in ADRs. ADRs are Depositary Receipts typically issued by
a U.S. bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying securities
issued by a foreign corporation. EDRs and GDRs are typically issued by foreign
banks or trust companies, although they also may be issued by U.S. banks
or trust companies, and evidence ownership of underlying securities issued
by either a foreign or a United States corporation. Generally, Depositary
Receipts in registered form are designed for use in the U.S. securities
market and Depositary Receipts in bearer form are designed for use in securities
markets outside the United States. Depositary Receipts may not necessarily
be denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities into which
they may be converted. Ownership of unsponsored Depositary Receipts may
not entitle a Fund to financial or other reports from the issuer of the
underlying security, to which it would be entitled as the owner of sponsored
Depositary Receipts. Depositary Receipts also involve the risks of other
investments in foreign securities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Fixed Rate Debt Obligations.</B> The Funds may invest in fixed rate securities,
including fixed rate securities with short-term characteristics. Fixed rate
securities with short-term characteristics are long-term debt obligations
but are treated in the market as having short maturities because call features
of the securities may make them callable within a short period of time.
A fixed rate security with short-term characteristics would include a fixed
income security priced close to call or redemption price or fixed income
security approaching maturity, where the expectation of call or redemption
is high.<BR>
<BR>
Fixed rate securities exhibit more price volatility during times of rising
or falling interest rates than securities with floating rates of interest.
This is because floating rate securities, as described below, behave like
short-term instruments in that the rate of interest they pay is subject
to periodic adjustments based on a designated interest rate index. Fixed
rate securities pay a fixed rate of interest and are more sensitive to fluctuating
interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates the value of a fixed
rate security is likely to fall. Fixed rate securities with short-term characteristics
are not subject to the same price volatility as fixed rate securities without
such characteristics. Therefore, they behave more like floating rate securities
with respect to price volatility.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Floating Rate Debt Obligations.</B> The Funds may invest in floating
rate debt obligations, including in- creasing rate securities. Floating
rate securities are generally offered at an initial interest rate which
is at or above prevailing market rates. The interest rate paid on these
securities is then reset periodically (commonly every 90 days to an increment
over some predetermined interest rate index). Commonly utilized indices
include the three-month Treasury bill rate, the 180-day Treasury bill rate,
the one-month or three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the
prime rate of a bank, the commercial paper rates, or the longer-term rates
on U.S. Treasury securities. Increasing rate securities' rates are reset
periodically at different levels on a predetermined scale. These levels
of interest are ordinarily set at progressively higher increments over time.
Some increasing rate securities may, by agreement, revert to a fixed rate
status. These securities may also contain features which allow the issuer
the option to convert the increasing rate of interest to a fixed rate under
such terms, conditions, and limitations as are described in each issuer's
prospectus.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Foreign Currency Transactions.</B> The <B>International Stock Fund</B>
may enter into foreign currency transactions to obtain the necessary currencies
to settle securities transactions. Currency transactions may be conducted
either on a spot or cash basis at prevailing rates or through forward foreign
currency exchange contracts. The <B>International Stock Fund</B> may also
enter into foreign currency transactions to protect its assets against adverse
changes in foreign currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations.
Such changes could unfavorably affect the value of Fund assets which are
denominated in foreign currencies, such as foreign securities or funds deposited
in foreign banks, as measured in U.S. dollars. Although foreign currency
exchanges may be used by the Fund to protect against a decline in the value
of one or more currencies, such efforts may also limit any potential gain
that might result from a relative increase in the value of such currencies
and might, in certain cases, result in losses to the Fund. Further, the
Fund may be affected either unfavorably or favorably by fluctuations in
the relative rates of exchange between the currencies of different nations.
Cross-hedging transactions by the Fund involve the risk of imperfect correlation
between changes in the values of the currencies to which such transactions
relate and changes in the value of the currency or other asset or liability
that is the subject of the hedge.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts and Options on Foreign Currencies.</B>
The <B>International Stock Fund</B> may enter into a forward foreign currency
exchange contract (&quot;forward contract''), which is an obligation to
purchase or sell an amount of a particular currency at a specific price
and on a future date agreed upon by the parties. Generally, no commission
charges or deposits are involved. At the time the International Stock Fund
enters into a forward contract, Fund assets with a value equal to the Fund's
obligation under the forward contract are segregated on the Fund's records
and are maintained until the contract has been settled. The Fund generally
will not enter into a forward contract with a term of more than one year.
The Fund will generally enter into a forward contract to provide the proper
currency to settle a securities transaction at the time the transaction
occurs (&quot;trade date''). The period between trade date and settlement
date will vary between twenty-four hours and thirty days, depending upon
local custom.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>International Stock Fund</B> may also protect against the decline
of a particular foreign currency by entering into a forward contract to
sell an amount of that currency approximating the value of all or a portion
of the Fund's assets denominated in that currency (&quot;hedging''). The
success of this type of short-term hedging strategy is highly uncertain
due to the difficulties of predicting short-term currency market movements
and of precisely matching forward contract amounts and the constantly changing
value of the securities involved. Although the Fund's Subadviser will consider
the likelihood of changes in currency values when making investment decisions,
the Subadviser believes that it is important to be able to enter into forward
contracts when it believes the interests of the Fund will be served. The
Fund will not enter into forward contracts for hedging purposes in a particular
currency in an amount in excess of the Fund's assets denominated in that
currency.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>International Stock Fund</B> may purchase and write put and call
options on foreign currencies for the purpose of protecting against declines
in the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated portfolio securities
and against increases in the U.S. dollar cost of such securities to be acquired.
As in the case of other kinds of options, however, the writing of an option
on a foreign currency constitutes only a partial hedge, up to the amount
of the premium received, and the Fund could be required to purchase or sell
foreign currencies at disadvantageous exchange rates, thereby incurring
losses. The purchase of an option on a foreign currency may constitute an
effective hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates although, in the
event of rate movements adverse to the Fund's position, it may forfeit the
entire amount of the premium plus related transaction costs. Options on
foreign currencies to be written or purchased by the Fund are traded on
U.S. and foreign exchanges or over-the-counter.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Forward Commitments.</B> Forward commitments are contracts to purchase
securities for a fixed price at a date beyond customary settlement time.
The <B>International Stock Fund </B>may enter into these contracts if liquid
securities in amounts sufficient to meet the purchase price are segregated
on the Fund's records at the trade date and maintained until the transaction
has been settled. Risk is involved if the value of the security declines
before settlement. Although the Fund enters into forward commitments with
the intention of acquiring the security, it may dispose of the commitment
prior to settlement and realize a short- term profit or loss.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Illiquid Securities.</B> These are any securities a Fund owns which it
may not be able to sell quickly (within seven days) at a fair price. The
<B>Money Market Fund</B> must limit such investments to 10% of its net assets
while the other Funds may not exceed 15% of their respective net assets.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lending Portfolio Securities.</B> In order to generate additional income,
each of the Funds is permitted as a fundamental investment policy to lend
portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, or both, up to
one-third of the value of its respective total assets to broker/dealers,
banks, or other institutional borrowers of securities. The Funds will only
enter into loan arrangements with broker/dealers, banks, or other institutions
which the Adviser or Subadviser has determined are creditworthy under guidelines
established by the Directors and will receive collateral in the form of
cash or U.S. government securities equal to at least 100% of the value of
the securities loaned. There is the risk that when lending portfolio securities,
the securities may not be available to the Fund on a timely basis and the
Fund may, therefore, lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable
price. In addition, in the event that a borrower of securities would file
for bankruptcy or become insolvent, disposition of the securities may be
delayed pending court action.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mortgage-Backed Securities.</B> All of the Funds except for the <B>Money
Market Fund</B> may invest in Mortgage-Backed Securities rated, at the time
of purchase, in the top three rating categories by an NRSRO (A or better
by S&amp;P, Fitch or Moody's), or, if unrated, of comparable quality as
determined by the Fund's Adviser or Subadviser. Mortgage-Backed Securities
are securities that directly or indirectly represent a participation in,
or are secured by and payable from, mortgage loans on real property. All
of the Funds except for the <B>Money Market Fund</B> may invest in Mortgage-Backed
Securities that are issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of
its agencies or instrumentalities, such as Government National Mortgage
Association (&quot;Ginnie Mae''), the Federal National Mortgage Association
(&quot;Fannie Mae'') and Federal Home Loan National Mortgage Corporation
(&quot;Freddie Mac''). Additionally, the <B>Income Funds</B> may invest
in Mortgage-Backed Securities (i) issued by private issuers that represent
an interest in or are collateralized by mortgage-backed securities issued
or guaranteed by the U.S. government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities
or (ii) issued by private issuers that represent an interest in or are collateralized
by whole loans or mortgage-backed securities without a government guarantee
but usually having some form of private credit enhancement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Adjustable Rate Mortgage Securities.</B> Adjustable rate mortgage securities
(&quot;ARMS'') are pass-through mortgage securities with adjustable rather
than fixed interest rates. The ARMS in which the Funds invest are issued
by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac and are actively traded. The
underlying mortgages which collateralize ARMS issued by Ginnie Mae are fully
guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (&quot;FHA'') or Veterans
Administration (&quot;VA''), while those collateralizing ARMS issued by
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are typically conventional residential mortgages
conforming to strict underwriting size and maturity constraints.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations.</B> Collateralized mortgage obligations
(&quot;CMOs'') are debt obligations collateralized by mortgage loans or
mortgage pass-through securities. Typically, CMOs are collateralized by
Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac certificates, but may be collateralized
by whole loans or private pass-through securities. CMOs may have fixed or
floating rates of interest.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>Short-Term Income Fund</B> and <B>Intermediate Bond Fund</B> will
only invest in CMOs which are rated in the top three rating categories by
an NRSRO (A or better by S&amp;P, Fitch or Moody's), and which may be (a)
collateralized by pools of mortgages in which each mortgage is guaranteed
as to payment of principal and interest by an agency or instrumentality
of the U.S. government; (b) collateralized by pools of mortgages in which
payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the issuer and such guarantee
is collateralized by U.S. government securities; or (c) collateralized by
pools of mortgages without a government guarantee as to payment of principal
and interest, but which have some form of credit enhancement.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>Government Income Fund</B> may invest in CMOs which may be: (i) collateralized
by pools of mortgages in which each mortgage is guaranteed as to payment
of principal and interest by an agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government;
(ii) collateralized by pools and mortgages in which payment of principal
and interest are guaranteed by the issuer and such guarantee is collateralized
by U.S. government securities; or (iii) privately issued securities in which
the proceeds of the issuance are invested in Mortgage-Backed Securities
and payment of the principal and interest is supported by the credit of
any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits.</B> Real estate mortgage investment
conduits (&quot;REMICs'') are offerings of multiple class real estate Mortgage-Backed
Securities which qualify and elect treatment as such under provisions of
the Internal Revenue Code. Issuers of REMICs may take several forms, such
as trusts, partnerships, corporations, associations or a segregated pool
of mortgages. Once REMIC status is elected and obtained, the entity is not
subject to federal income taxation. Instead, income is passed through the
entity and is taxed to the person or persons who hold interests in the REMIC.
A REMIC interest must consist of one or more classes of &quot;regular interests,''
some of which may offer adjustable rates, and a single class of &quot;residual
interests.'' To qualify as a REMIC, substantially all of the assets of the
entity must be in assets directly or indirectly secured principally by real
property.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Municipal Securities.</B> The <B>Tax-Free Income Funds</B>, the <B>Short-Term
Income Fund</B> and the <B>Intermediate Bond Fund</B> may invest in Municipal
Securities, which are generally issued to finance public works such as airports,
bridges, highways, housing, hospitals, mass transportation projects, schools,
streets, and water and sewer works. They are also issued to repay outstanding
obligations, to raise funds for general operating expenses, and to make
loans to other public institutions and facilities.<BR>
<BR>
Municipal Securities include industrial development bonds issued by or on
behalf of public authorities to provide financing aid to acquire sites or
construct and equip facilities for privately or publicly owned corpora-
tions. The availability of this financing encourages these corporations
to locate within the sponsoring communities and thereby increases local
employment.<BR>
<BR>
The two principal classifications of Municipal Securities are &quot;general
obligation'' and &quot;revenue'' bonds. General obligation bonds are secured
by the issuer's pledge of its full faith and credit and taxing power for
the payment of principal and interest. Interest on and principal of revenue
bonds, however, are payable only from the revenue generated by the facility
financed by the bond or other specified sources of revenue. Revenue bonds
do not represent a pledge of credit or create any debt of or charge against
the general revenues of a municipality or public authority. Industrial development
bonds are typically classified as revenue bonds.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Municipal Leases.</B> The <B>Tax-Free Income Funds</B> may purchase municipal
leases, which are obligations issued by state and local governments or authorities
to finance the acquisition of equipment and facilities and may be considered
to be illiquid. They may take the form of a lease, an installment purchase
contract, a conditional sales contract, or a participation interest in any
of these.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Participation Interests.</B> The <B>Tax-Free Income Funds</B> may purchase
interests in Municipal Securities from financial institutions such as commercial
and investment banks, savings and loan associations and insurance companies.
These interests may take the form of participations, beneficial interests
in a trust, partnership interests or any other form of indirect ownership
that allows the Funds to treat the income from the investment as exempt
from federal income tax. The financial institutions from which the Funds
purchase participation interests frequently provide or obtain irrevocable
letters of credit or guarantees to attempt to assure that the participation
interests are of acceptable quality. The Funds invest in these participation
interests in order to obtain credit enhancement or demand features that
would not be available through direct ownership of the underlying Municipal
Securities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Options On Securities or Indices and Futures Contracts.</B> In order
to hedge against market shifts, a Fund may purchase put and call options
on securities or securities indices. In addition, a Fund may seek to generate
income to offset operating expenses and/or may hedge a portion of its portfolio
investments through writing (i.e., selling) covered put and call options.
An option on a security is a contract that permits the purchaser of the
option, in return for the premium paid, the right to buy a specified security
(in the case of a call option) or to sell a specified security (in the case
of a put option) from or to the writer of the option at a designated price
during the term of the option. An option on a securities index permits the
purchaser of the option, in return for the premium paid, the right to receive
from the seller cash equal to the difference between the closing price of
the index and the exercise price of the option. A Fund may write a call
or put option only if the option is &quot;covered.'' This means that so
long as the Fund is obligated as the writer of a call option, it will own
the underlying securities subject to the call, or hold a call at the same
exercise price, for the same exercise period, and on the same securities
as the written call. A put is covered if the Fund maintains liquid assets
with a value equal to the exercise price in a segregated account, or holds
a put on the underlying securities at an equal or greater exercise price.
The value of the underlying securities on which options may be written at
any one time will not exceed 25% of the total assets of a Fund. A Fund will
not purchase put or call options if the aggregate premium paid for such
options would exceed 5% of its net assets at the time of the purchase.<BR>
<BR>
Options purchased or written by a Fund may be traded on United States and
foreign exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets. Over-the-counter options
are two-party contracts with price and terms negotiated between buyer and
seller. In contrast, exchange-traded options are third-party contracts with
standardized strike prices and expirations dates and are purchased from
a clearing corporation. Exchange-traded options generally have a continuous
liquid market while over-the-counter options may not. A Fund purchases and
writes options only with investment dealers and other financial institutions
(such as commercial banks or savings and loan associations) deemed creditworthy
by the Fund's investment adviser or subadviser.<BR>
<BR>
The Funds, other than the <B>Money Market Fund</B>, <B>Short-Term Income
Fund</B>, or <B>Intermediate Bond Fund</B>, may invest in futures for bona
fide hedging purposes. Although the Funds have the ability to invest up
to 5% of their respective net assets in futures for other than bona fide
hedging purposes, they have no present intention to do so. The ability to
engage in futures transactions is a fundamental investment policy. For hedging
purposes only, a Fund may buy and sell covered financial futures contracts,
stock index futures contracts, foreign currency futures contracts and options
on any of the foregoing. A financial futures contract is an agreement between
two parties to buy or sell a specified debt security at a set price on a
future date. An index futures contract is an agreement to take or make delivery
of an amount of cash based on the difference between the value of the index
at the beginning and at the end of the contract period. A futures contract
on a foreign currency is an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount
of a currency for a set price on a future date. When a Fund enters into
a futures contract, it must make an initial deposit, known as &quot;initial
margin,'' as a partial guarantee of its performance under the contract.
As the value of the security, index, or currency fluctuates, either party
to the contract is required to make additional margin payments, known as
&quot;variation margin,'' to cover any additional obligation it may have
under the contract. In addition, when a Fund enters into a futures contract,
it will segregate assets to &quot;cover'' its position in accordance with
the Act. See &quot;Investment Objectives and Policies &Oacute;Futures and
Options Transactions'' in the Statement of Additional Information.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Prime Commercial Paper.</B> The Funds may purchase Prime Commercial Paper,
which is a short-term debt obligation that matures in 270 days or less,
is issued by banks, corporations or other institutions, and is rated one
of the two highest rating categories for short-term obligations by an NRSRO
or are of comparable quality to securities having such ratings.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Portfolio Turnover.</B> Although none of the Funds intends to invest
for the purpose of seeking short-term profits, securities will be sold whenever
the Fund's Adviser or Subadviser believes it is appropriate to do so in
light of the Fund's investment objective, without regard to the length of
time a particular security may have been held. The annual rate of portfolio
turnover for the <B>Short-Term Income Fund</B>, <B>Government Income Fund</B>
and <B>Intermediate Bond Fund</B> may exceed that of certain other mutual
funds with the same investment objective. A higher rate of portfolio turnover
involves correspondingly greater transaction expenses which must be borne
directly by the Fund and, thus, indirectly by its shareholders. In addition,
a high rate of portfolio turnover may result in the realization of larger
amounts of capital gains which, when distributed to the Fund's shareholders,
are taxable to them. Nevertheless, transactions for a Fund's portfolio will
be based upon investment considerations and will not be limited by any other
considerations when the Fund's investment adviser or subadviser deems it
appropriate to make changes in the Fund's portfolio.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ratings.</B> Securities rated in the fourth highest investment grade
category (Baa by Moody's, or BBB by S&amp;P or Fitch) have speculative characteristics
and changes in economic conditions or other circumstances are more likely
to lead to a weakened capacity to make principal and interest payments than
higher rated securities. The Fund's Statement of Additional Information
contains complete descriptions of ratings. A Fund's Adviser or Subadviser
will evaluate downgraded securities on a case-by-case basis and will sell
any security determined not to be an acceptable investment.<BR>
<BR>
An NRSRO's highest rating category is determined without regard for sub-categories
and gradations. For example, securities rated A-1 or A-1 by S&amp;P or Prime-1
by Moody's are all considered rated in the highest short-term rating category.
The <B>Money Market Fund</B> will follow applicable regulations in determining
whether a security rated by more than one NRSRO can be treated as being
in the highest short-term rating category; currently, such securities must
be rated by two NRSROs in their highest rating category. The <B>Money Market
Fund</B> may purchase single rated securities that are rated in the highest
rating category by an NRSRO. Unrated securities may be treated as &quot;First
Tier'' securities and are also eligible for purchase by the <B>Money Market
Fund</B>, subject to a determination of comparability by the Adviser. Acquisition
of such unrated securities must be ratified by the Directors quarterly.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Restricted Securities.</B> Each of the Funds may invest in restricted
securities. These are securities in which each Fund normally invests but
which are subject to legal restrictions when a Fund sells them. Restricted
securities which are not determined by the Directors to be liquid will be
limited to 5% of total assets for the Equity Funds and 10% of total assets
for all other Funds.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Repurchase Agreements.</B> The securities in which the Funds invest may
be purchased pursuant to repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are
arrangements in which banks, broker/dealers, and other recognized financial
institutions sell U.S. government securities or other securities to a Fund
and agree at the time of sale to repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon
time and price. To the extent that the original seller does not repurchase
the securities from a Fund, the Fund could receive less than the repurchase
price on any sale of such securities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Securities of Other Investment Companies.</B> Each of the Funds may invest
in the securities of other investment companies, but will not own more than
3% of the total outstanding voting stock of any investment company, invest
more than 5% of its respective total assets in any one investment company,
or invest more than 10% of its respective total assets in investment companies
in general. Except for the <B>International Stock Fund</B>, the Funds will
invest in other investment companies primarily for the purpose of investing
short-term cash which has not yet been invested in other portfolio instruments.
Although the Adviser will waive its investment advisory fee on that portion
of a Fund's assets invested in securities of open-end investment companies,
there will still be some duplication of expenses caused by one investment
company investing in another.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>International Stock Fund</B> may invest indirectly in foreign capital
markets by purchasing shares of closed-end investment companies, but generally
only in open-market transactions involving only customary brokerage commissions.
Sometimes the Fund may pay a premium over net asset value for such shares.
The Funds will only purchase shares of other openend investment companies
whose sales loads, if any, are less than 1.00% of their offering prices.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Swap Transactions.</B> As one way of managing its exposure to different
types of investments, each of the Funds (except the <B>Money Market Fund</B>)
may invest up to 5% of their respective net assets in swap transactions,
including interest rate and index-based swaps. See &quot;Investment Objectives
and Policies &Oacute;Swap Transactions'' in the Statement of Additional
Information.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Temporary Investments.</B> When the Adviser or Subadviser judges that
market conditions warrant a defensive investment position (this rarely applies
to the <B>Money Market Fund</B>), each of the Funds may temporarily invest
without limit in short-term debt obligations (money market instruments).
These investments include commercial paper, bank instruments, U.S. government
obligations, repurchase agreements, securities of other investment companies,
taxable or tax-free <B>Municipal Securities</B> (for the <B>Tax-Free Income
Funds</B>) and foreign securities (for the <B>International Stock Fund</B>).
The <B>Tax-Free Income Funds</B> do not currently intend to make any taxable
investments although they are permitted to do so. Each Fund's temporary
investments must be of comparable quality to its primary investments.<BR>
<BR>
<B>U.S. Government Securities.</B> All of the Funds may invest in U.S. Government
Securities, which generally include direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury
(such as U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds) and obliga- tions (including
Mortgage-Backed Securities, bonds, notes and discount notes) issued or guaranteed
by the following U.S. government agencies or instrumen- talities: Federal
Home Loan Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association, Government National
Mortgage Association, Bank for Cooperatives (including Central Bank for
Cooperatives), Federal Land Banks, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, Tennessee
Valley Authority, Export-Import Bank of the United States, Commodity Credit
Corporation, Federal Financing Bank, The Student Loan Marketing Association,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or National Credit Union Administration.
These securities are backed by: the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury;
the issuer's right to borrow an amount limited to a specific line of credit
from the U.S. Treasury; the discretionary authority of the U.S. government
to purchase certain obligations of agencies or instrumentalities; or the
credit of the agency or instrumentality issuing the obligations.<BR>
<BR>
Examples of agencies and instrumentalities which are permissible investments
which may not always receive financial support from the U.S. government
are: Federal Farm Credit Banks; Federal Home Loan Banks; Federal National
Mortgage Association; The Student Loan Marketing Association; and Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Variable Rate Demand Notes.</B> Each of the Funds may purchase variable
rate demand notes, which are long-term debt instruments that have variable
or floating interest rates and provide the Fund with the right to tender
the security for repurchase at its stated principal amount plus accrued
interest. Such securities typically bear interest at a rate that is intended
to cause the securities to trade at par. The interest rate may float or
be adjusted at regular intervals (ranging from daily to annually), and is
normally based on a published interest rate or interest rate index. Many
variable rate demand notes allow a Fund to demand the repurchase of the
security on not more than seven days prior notice. Other notes only permit
a Fund to tender the security at the time of each interest rate adjustment
or at other fixed intervals.<BR>
<BR>
<B>When-Issued and Delayed Delivery Transactions.</B> The Funds may purchase
portfolio securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis. These transactions
are arrangements in which a Fund purchases securities with payment and delivery
scheduled for a future time. The seller's failure to complete these transactions
may cause a Fund to miss a price or yield considered to be advantageous.
Settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions,
and the market values of the securities purchased may vary from the purchase
prices. Accordingly, a Fund may pay more or less than the market value of
the securities on the settlement date.<BR>
<BR>
The Funds may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the Adviser
or Subadviser deems it appropriate to do so. In addition, a Fund may enter
into transactions to sell its purchase commitments to third parties at current
market values and simultaneously acquire other commitments to purchase similar
securities at later dates. The Fund may realize short-term profits or losses
upon the sale of such commitments.</P>

<H3><A NAME="AIR"></A>ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT RISKS</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Debt Market.</B> In the debt market, prices move inversely
to interest rates. A decline in market interest rates results in a rise
in the market prices of outstanding debt obligations. Conversely, an increase
in market interest rates results in a decline in market prices of outstanding
debt obligations. In either case, the amount of change in market prices
of debt obligations in response to changes in market interest rates generally
depends on the maturity of the debt obligations: the debt obligations with
the longest maturities will experience the greatest market price changes.<BR>
<BR>
The market value of debt obligations, and therefore each Fund's net asset
value, will fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions and other market
factors such as interest rates which are beyond the control of the Funds'
Adviser or Subadviser. The Funds' Adviser or Subadviser could be incorrect
in its expectations about the direction or extent of these market factors.
Although debt obligations with longer maturities offer potentially greater
returns, they have greater exposure to market price fluctuation. Consequently,
to the extent a Fund is significantly invested in debt obligations with
longer maturities, there is a greater possibility of fluctuation in the
Fund's net asset value.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mortgage-Backed and Asset-Backed Securities.</B> Mortgage-Backed and
Asset-Backed Securities generally pay back principal and interest over the
life of the security. At the time a Fund reinvests the payments and any
unscheduled prepayments of principal received, such Fund may receive a rate
of interest which is actually lower than the rate of interest paid on these
securities (&quot;prepayment risks''). Mortgage-Backed and Asset-Backed
Securities are subject to higher prepayment risks than most other types
of debt instruments with prepayment risks because the underlying mortgage
loans or the collateral supporting Asset-Backed Securities may be prepaid
without penalty or premium. Prepayment risks on Mortgage-Backed Securities
tend to increase during periods of declining mortgage interest rates because
many borrowers refinance their mortgages to take advantage of the more favorable
rates. Prepayments on Mortgage-Backed Securities are also affected by other
factors, such as the frequency with which people sell their homes or elect
to make unscheduled payments on their mortgages. Although Asset-Backed Securities
generally are less likely to experience substantial prepayments than are
Mortgage-Backed Securities, certain factors that affect the rate of prepayments
on Mortgage-Backed Securities also affect the rate of prepayments on Asset-Backed
Securities.<BR>
<BR>
While Mortgage-Backed Securities generally entail less risk of a decline
during periods of rapidly rising interest rates, Mortgage-Backed Securities
may also have less potential for capital appreciation than other similar
investments (e.g., investments with comparable maturities) because as interest
rates decline, the likelihood increases that mortgages will be prepaid.
Furthermore, if Mortgage-Backed Securities are purchased at a premium, mortgage
foreclosures and unscheduled principal payments may result in some loss
of a holder's principal investment to the extent of the premium paid. Conversely,
if Mortgage-Backed Securities are purchased at a discount, both a scheduled
payment of principal and an unscheduled prepayment of principal would increase
current and total returns and would accelerate the recognition of income,
which would be taxed as ordinary income when distributed to shareholders.<BR>
<BR>
Asset-Backed Securities present certain risks that are not presented by
Mortgage-Backed Securities. Pri- marily, these securities do not have the
benefit of the same security interest in the related collateral. Credit
card receivables are generally unsecured and the debtors are entitled to
the protection of a number of state and federal consumer credit laws, many
of which give such debtors the right to set off certain amounts owed on
the credit cards, thereby reducing the balance due. Most issuers of Asset-Backed
Securities backed by motor vehicle installment purchase obligations permit
the service of such receivables to retain possession of the underlying obligations.
If the service sells these obligations to another party, there is a risk
that the purchaser would acquire an interest superior to that of the holders
of the related Asset- Backed Securities. Further, if a vehicle is registered
in one state and is then re-registered because the owner and obligor moves
to another state, such rere-gistration could defeat the original security
interest in the vehicle in certain cases. In addition, because of the large
number of vehicles involved in a typical issuance and technical requirements
under state laws, the trustee for the holders of Asset-Backed Securities
backed by automobile receivables may not have a proper security interest
in all of the obligations backing such receivables. Therefore, there is
the possibility that recoveries on repossessed collateral may not, in some
cases, be available to support payments on these securities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Municipal Securities.</B> Yields on Municipal Securities depend on a
variety of factors, including: the general conditions of the short-term
municipal note market and of the municipal bond market; the size of the
particular offering; the maturity of the obligations; and the rating of
the issue. The ability of a Fund to achieve its investment objective also
depends on the continuing ability of the issuers of Municipal Securities
and demand features, or the credit enhancers of either, to meet their obligations
for the payment of interest and principal when due.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Stock Market.</B> As with other mutual funds that invest primarily in
equity securities, the Equity Funds are subject to market risks. That is,
the possibility exists that common stocks will decline over short or even
extended periods of time, and the United States equity market tends to be
cyclical, experiencing both periods when stock prices generally increase
and periods when stock prices generally decrease.</P>

<MENU>
  <P><B>Medium Capitalization Stocks.</B> Stocks in the medium capitalization
  sector of the United States equity market tend to be slightly more volatile
  in price than larger capitalization stocks, such as those included in the
  S&amp;P 500. This is because, among other things, medium-sized companies
  have less certain growth prospects in larger companies, have a lower degree
  of liquidity in the equity market, and tend to have a greater sensitivity
  to changing economic conditions. Further, in addition to exhibiting slightly
  higher volatility, the stocks of medium-sized companies may, to some degree,
  fluctuate independently of the stocks of large companies. That is, the
  stocks of medium-sized companies may decline in price as the price of large
  company stocks rises or vice versa. Therefore, investors should expect
  that the <B>Mid-Cap Stock Fund</B>, which invests primarily in me- dium
  capitalization stocks, will be slightly more volatile than, and may fluctuate
  independently of, broad stock market indices such as the S&amp;P 500.
</MENU>

<P><BR>
<B>Foreign Securities.</B> Investing in non-U.S. securities carries substantial
risks in addition to those associated with domestic investments. (Excluding
Foreign Money Market Instruments and Depositary Receipts, only the <B>International
Stock Fund</B> intends to invest more than 5% of its net assets in Foreign
Securities). The risks associated with investing in foreign securities include:
risks of adverse political and economic developments (including possible
governmental seizure or nationalization of assets); the possible imposition
of exchange controls or other governmental restrictions; default in foreign
government securities; foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform
financial reporting, auditing and accounting standards, and auditing practices
and requirements may not be comparable to those applicable to U.S. companies;
less readily available market quotations on foreign companies; the possibility
of less publicly available information on foreign securities and their issuers;
differences in government regulation and supervision of foreign stock exchanges,
brokers, listed companies, and banks; generally lower foreign stock market
volume; the likelihood that foreign securities may be less liquid or more
volatile; foreign brokerage commissions and other transaction costs (such
as custodial services) may be higher; unreliable mail service between countries;
restrictions on foreign investments in other jurisdictions; difficulties
which may be encountered in obtaining or enforcing a court judgment abroad
and affecting repatriation of capital invested abroad; and delays or problems
in settlement of foreign transactions, which could adversely affect shareholder
equity or cause the Fund to miss attractive investment opportunities. In
addition, foreign securities may be subject to foreign taxes, which reduce
yield and total return.<BR>
<BR>
In an attempt to reduce some of these risks, the <B>International Stock
Fund</B> diversifies its investments broadly among foreign countries, including
both developed and developing countries. At least three different countries
will always be represented in the <B>International Stock Fund's</B> portfolio.<BR>
<BR>
The <B>International Stock Fund</B> occasionally takes advantage of the
unusual opportunities for higher returns available from investing in developing
countries. Investments in companies domiciled in developing countries may
be subject to potentially higher risks and volatility than investments in
developed countries with more mature economies. These risks include: (i)
less social, political and economic stability; (ii) the small current size
of the markets for such securities and the currently low or nonexistent
volume of trading, which result in a lack of liquidity and greater price
volatility; (iii) certain national policies which may restrict the <B>International
Stock Fund's</B> investment opportunities, including restrictions on investment
in issuers or industries deemed sensitive to national interests; (iv) the
absence of developed legal structures governing private or foreign investment
or allowing for judicial redress for injury to private property; (v) the
absence, until recently in certain Eastern European countries, of a capital
market structure or market-oriented economy; and (vi) the possibility that
recent favorable economic developments in Eastern Europe may be slowed or
reversed by unanticipated political or social events in such countries.</P>

<MENU>
  <P><B>Exchange Rates.</B> Foreign securities may be denominated in foreign
  currencies although only the <B>International Stock Fund</B> intends to
  invest in such foreign currency-denominated securities to a significant
  extent. Therefore, the value in U.S. dollars of the <B>International Stock
  Fund's</B> assets and income may be affected by changes in exchange rates
  and regulations. Although the <B>International Stock Fund</B> values its
  assets daily in U.S. dollars, it will not convert its holding of foreign
  currencies to U.S. dollars daily. When the <B>International Stock Fund</B>
  converts its holdings to another currency, it may incur conversion costs.
  Foreign exchange dealers realize a profit on the difference between the
  prices at which they buy and sell currencies.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Foreign Money Market Instruments.</B> ECDs, ETDs, Yankee CDs, and Europaper
  are subject to somewhat different risks than domestic obligations of domestic
  issuers. Examples of these risks include international, economic, and political
  developments, foreign governmental restrictions that may adversely affect
  the payment of principal or interest, foreign withholding or other taxes
  on interest income, difficulties in obtaining or enforcing a judgment against
  the issuing bank, and the possible impact of interruptions in the flow
  of international currency transactions. Different risks may also exist
  for ECDs, ETDs, and Yankee CDs because the banks issuing these instruments,
  or their domestic or foreign branches, are not necessarily subject to the
  same regulatory requirements that apply to domestic banks, such as reserve
  requirements, loan limitations, examinations, accounting, auditing, and
  recordkeeping, and the public availability of information. These factors
  will be carefully considered by a Fund's Adviser or Subadviser in selecting
  these investments.<BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>U.S. Government Policies.</B> In the past, U.S. government policies
  have discouraged or restricted certain investments abroad by investors
  such as the International Stock Fund. When such policies are instituted,
  the Fund will abide by them.
</MENU>

<P><BR>
<B>Futures And Options.</B> When a Fund uses futures and options on futures
as hedging devices, there is a risk that the prices of the securities subject
to the futures contracts may not correlate with the prices of the securities
in the Fund's portfolio. This may cause the futures contract and any related
options to react differently than the portfolio securities to market changes.
In addition, the Fund's Adviser or Subadviser could be incorrect in its
expectations about the direction or extent of market factors such as interest
or currency exchange rate movements. In these events, the Fund may lose
money on the futures contract or option. Also, it is not certain that a
secondary market for positions in futures contracts or for options will
exist at all times. Although the Fund's Adviser or Subadviser will consider
liquidity before entering into such transactions, there is no assurance
that a liquid secondary market on an exchange or otherwise will exist for
any particular futures contract or option at any particular time. The Fund's
ability to establish and close out futures and options positions depends
on this secondary market.</P>

<H2><A NAME="TI"></A>TAX INFORMATION <HR ALIGN=LEFT></H2>

<H3><A NAME="FIT"></A>FEDERAL INCOME TAX</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>None of the Funds will pay federal income tax because
each expects to meet requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
to regulated investment companies and to receive the special tax treatment
afforded to such companies. Each Fund will be treated as a single, separate
entity for federal income tax purposes so that income (including capital
gains) and losses realized by the other Funds of the Corporation, if any,
will not be combined for tax purposes with those realized by any of the
other Funds.</P>

<P>Unless otherwise exempt, you are required to pay federal income tax on
any dividends and other distributions received. However, shareholders of
<B>Short-Term Tax-Free Fund</B> and <B>Intermediate Tax-Free Fund</B> are
not required to pay the federal regular income tax on any dividends received
from the Fund that represent net interest on tax-exempt municipal bonds;
but, under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, dividends representing net interest
earned on certain &quot;private-activity'' municipal bonds may be included
in calculating the federal individual alternative minimum tax or the federal
alternative minimum tax for corporations. Dividends of the <B>Tax-Free Income
Funds</B> rep-resenting net interest income earned on some temporary investments
and any realized net short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income.<BR>
<BR>
Investment income received by the <B>International Stock Fund</B> from sources
within foreign countries may be subject to foreign taxes withheld at the
source. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign
countries that entitle the <B>International Stock Fund</B> to reduced tax
rates or exemptions on this income. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot
be predicted since the amount of <B>International Stock Fund's</B> assets
to be invested within various countries is unknown. However, the <B>International
Stock Fund</B> intends to operate so as to qualify for treaty-reduced tax
rates where applicable.<BR>
<BR>
If more than 50% of the value of the <B>International Stock Fund's</B> assets
at the end of the tax year is represented by stock or securities of foreign
corporations, the <B>International Stock Fund</B> intends to qualify for
certain Internal Revenue Code stipulations that would allow shareholders
to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction on their U.S. income tax returns.
The Internal Revenue Code may limit a shareholder's ability to claim a foreign
tax credit. Furthermore, shareholders who elect to deduct their portion
of the <B>International Stock Fund's</B> foreign taxes rather than take
the foreign tax credit must itemize deductions on their income tax returns.<BR>
<BR>
These tax consequences apply whether dividends are received in cash or as
additional shares. Information on the tax status of dividends and distributions
is provided annually.</P>

<H3><A NAME="SALT"></A>STATE AND LOCAL TAXES</H3>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>Distributions representing net interest received on tax-exempt
municipal securities are not necessarily free from income taxes of any state
or local taxing authority. State laws differ on this issue, and you should
consult your tax adviser for specific details.</P>

<H2><A NAME="EOBL"></A>EFFECT OF BANKING LAWS</H2>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P>M&amp;I Corp. believes, based on the advice of its counsel, that M&amp;I
Investment Management Corp. may perform the services contemplated by the
investment advisory agreement with the Corporation without violation of
the Glass-Steagall Act or other applicable banking laws or regulations.
Changes in either federal or state statutes and regulations relating to
the permissible activities of banks and their subsidiaries or affiliates,
as well as further judicial or administrative decisions or interpretations
of such present or future statutes and regulations, could prevent M&amp;I
Investment Management Corp. or M&amp;I Corp. from continuing to perform
all or a part of the above services for its customers and/or a Fund. In
such event, the Directors would consider alternative advisers and means
of continuing available investment services.</P>

  <LI>Data quoted represents past performance and is not indicative of future
  results.<BR>
  
  <LI>Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so when shares
  are redeemed they may be worth more or less than the original cost.<BR>
  
  <LI>Total return represents the change in the value of an investment alter
  reinvesting all income and capital gains. The investment advisor, may from
  time to time, waive all or part of its fee and/or reimburse the Funds for
  some of its expenses. This increases a Fund's income and total return;
  otherwise, total return would have been lower.<BR>
  
  <LI>Marshall Money Market Fund-Class B Shares are subject to 12h-1 fees,
  which reduce the amount of income paid to shareholders. Class B shares

  performance date for the fund includes the performance of the collective
  trust fund for periods before the Fund's registration statement became
  effective adjusted to reflect estimated Fund expenses. The collective trust
  fund was not registered under the investment Company Act of 1940 and therefore
  was not subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by
  the Act. If the collective trust fund had been registered under the 1940
  Act, its performance may have been adversely affected.<BR>
  
  <LI>Small-Cap Fund's offer a higher total return for a higher degree of
  risk.<BR>

effectively with Common Link.</I></B></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Common Link can provide you with an Internet account using the
Point to Point Protocal (PPP). <B>PPP</B> is state-of-the-art in Internet
access for the individual or small business and brings the Internet right
to your computer. Unlike a Shell account, where the character-based Internet
access utilities run on a UNIX computer at a distant site, your computer
becomes an actual site on the Internet, allowing you to run Internet software
specifically suited to maximize the capabilities of your computer. Among
the many advantages is the ability to use the latest graphical display technology
with Macintosh and Windows applications, such as the easy-to-use Mosaic
or Netscape World Wide Web browsers.<BR>
<BR>
Common Link offers PPP at modem speeds up to 28.8 bps for our subscribers.
Currently, 28.8 is the recommended modem standard. If your modem is a 14.4
bps, don't fret - 28.8 is faster, but 14.4 is an acceptable speed for most
tasks. For your own satisfaction - modem speeds less than 9600 bps are not
recommended for this service.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>A Brief History of how our service began:</B><BR>
Common Link was founded June 22, 1993 as a small on-line system. Over the
last three years, our high-quality graphical system began to grow and show
extremely high potential as a solid on-line tool. These years of experience
have taught us how to effectively set-up, support, and maintain such a system
which also showcases our superior graphics. This valuable experience has
helped make us the most successful on-line service in the state of Iowa.
Today we house over 1,000 users, and continue to lead the way in local on-line
communication. <BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="87%" SIZE="3"><B>Common Link On-line Service &amp;

If Internet E-Mail and Usenet News Groups are all the access you need, our
on-line service is the place for you. We make it easy &amp; fun to use.
Share in all of the features (listed below) and more for one very low price.

<DD>Since the early 1800's, there has been a determined effort by people of good-will to eliminate attitudes of racial superiority.   This has largely been attempted through legislative action and other anti-racism campaigns.  The failure of civil rights laws and other activities to acheive this end shows that combatting racism by itself is inadequate.  This link leads to resources and organizations on the Internet that promote the unity of the races.

This site developed on a Mac SE/30 8/720 running system 7.5 using WebWeaver 2.5.2.  I'ld be a bigger fan of Wintel machines if they could run Windows 95 on a 386 as easy as I run system 7.5 on an 030.<BR>
<BR>
My thanks to <A HREF="http://www.commonlink.com/">Common Link</A> for providing low cost I'net access with excellent tech support, partially because it too runs on a Mac.<BR>

<H2>Economic Development</H2>
VISION STATEMENT:<BR>
West Des Moines is a community dedicated to the economic success of new
and existing businesses through diversified, balanced and planned growth.
For its residents and workers, West Des Moines seeks to provide a quality
of life consistent with their values for excellence, including learning,
cultural and recreational opportunities and ethical response to change with
the community and the surrounding region.<BR>
<BR>
A &quot;Marketing A-Team&quot; is established to introduce and follow through
on new business contacts. Six key areas have been defined with a specific
resource contact for each category.<BR>
<BR>
There is a specialist that can provide specific information on:<BR>
Real Estatate<BR>
Human Resources<BR>
Taxation and Government<BR>
Financing and Incentives<BR>
Cultural Arts, Churches, Recreation<BR>
Education<BR>
<BR>
West Des Moines has had its share of economic success. Some examples include:
<H3>Westown Parkway Corridor</H3>
The city's desire to attract office users and developers by extablishing
Professional commerce Park District (P.C.P.) zoning which ignited the highly
successful development along the Westown Parkway Corridor.<BR>
<BR>
The Mid-America Group led the way with the westridge Office Park between
28th and 30th Streets and the eight-building Regency West comples, followed
by R &amp; R's Three Fountains Office Park and Century I, II, and III buildings.<BR>
<BR>
Further development of the Westown Parkway corridor will occur after a proposed
bridge is built over Interstate 35/80.<BR>
<H3>Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc.</H3>
Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc. willmove its corporate headquarters to West Des
Moines from Chariton, Iowa by 1995. The new West Des Moines location will
consist of a 128,000 square-foot headquarters and convention facilities
at West lakes Office Park and will provide Hy-Vee with access to needed
meeting and training facilities, child care services, state of the art communications
systems, and central location with interstate access to a seven state territory.<BR>
<H3>Glen Oaks Golf Course Community</H3>
A $20-million, 15-story brick and glass condominium tower is being added
to the northwest corner of the exclusive Glen Oaks golf course community
located in West Des Moines. The project, called Glennan Tower, will feature
54 units ranging from $100,000 to $623,000. Glen Oaks is situated on 532
acres and is the only residential development in Iowa that is enclosed by
stone and wood fences and offers around the clock security. The development
includes a $5-million clubhouse with swimming pool, tennis courts and croquet
lawn.<BR>
<H3>West Lakes</H3>
West Lakes Development Co., the largest office park in Iow, is a partnership
of Central Properties, Western Properties, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Iowa, and Farm Bureau Insurance Co. Nearly 80,000 square feet of speculative
office space will be bult at the West Des Moines West lakes Office Park
by the end of 1994. The two single-story buildings will feature multi-tenant
units, each approximately 39,000 square feet. West lakes Office Park is
a 400-acre development at the intersection of Interstates 35-80. At the
end of march, 1994, only 52 acres of land remained for development.<BR>

The parks system within the City of West Des Moines is keeping pace with

of a complex community. Wooded picnic areas, large open play fields, a community
swimming pool, modern shelters, basketball, tennis and volleyball courts,
baseball and softball fields, and children's play structures can be found
in exising parks. A number of proposed parks are planned fordevelopment
within the next 5 years. Included are: the Jordan Creek Park, Racoon River
Regional Park, and three neighborhood parks in growing areas of the city.
Unique facilities may include: nature, biking and hiking trails, soccer
complex, softball complex, boat access to a 250 acre lake, and much more!<BR>
<BR>
Gary Scott, Director of Parks &amp; Recreation, offers the following as
a mission statement: 
<H3>&quot;To establish and maintain a comprehensive public park and recreation
system that will enhance the quality of life for the citizens of West Des
Moines.&quot;</H3>

<H2>Valley Junction</H2>
Valley Junction began in 1846 when its first settler, James Jordan, arrived.
The name Valley Junction was chosen because it was located in the valley
of the Raccoon River and served as the junction for the railroad. By the
turn of the century, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific railroads moved
their operations to the area. After the railroad boom ended, Valley Juncton
slowed its pace and changed its name to West Des Moines in 1938.<BR>
<BR>
In 1893, Valley Junction bustled with horse drawn traffic, a trolley line,
eight-foot-wide wooden sidewalks, and dirt streets lined with three banks,
three drug stores and several &quot;boarding houses&quot; of questionable
character. By the turn of the century, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific
railroads made Valley Junction a popular stop where 26 passenger trains
arrived and departed daily.<BR>
<BR>
Jill Downing, program manager for the Valley Junction Foundation, is always
working to promote the Valley Junction area.<BR>
<BR>
Outdoor concerts, holiday open houses, art fairs, and several other events
and activities create an exciting atmosphere for visitors.<BR>
<BR>
Midwest Living Magazine honored Valley Junction as an &quot;Undiscovered
Shopping District.&quot; The Junction is a &quot;Main Street Town.&quot;
This designation qualifies the community for special funding from the federal
and state governments.

Bittick, is a German name. We know of three Bittick Brothers that came from
Germany to Chicago after WW1. One of them stayed in Chicago, while the other
two went to Trenton, Missouri and Anaheim, California. My father was born
in Chicago, but he and his mother moved to Humeston, Iowa after the death
of his father - Charles. S. Bittick Sr. <BR>

<TITLE>What is Chiron Rising</TITLE>
<HEAD> 
<H1><CENTER>What is Chiron Rising?</CENTER></H1>
<BR>

</HEAD> 

<BODY> 
Chiron was a character in Greek mythology.  There are a number of versions of the story, so you may find one that differs somewhat from the one I tell here.<BR>
<BR>
Chiron was the last king of the Centaurs, the race that preceded man.  He saw the rise of man and realized that the Centaur was doomed; that man would replace them.  He also knew the history of the Centaur, how hard and long they had struggled to attain the level of civilization they had.  He decided that he would help mankind by providing  some of the information that had taken the Centaur generations to learn.  <BR>
<BR>
This decision made the gods angry, and Zeus had him killed.  Chiron became the first martyr to the new race of men.  Later, Zeus repented and gave him a place among the stars; he is what we call the constellation of Sagitarius.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Chiron is also the name of an eccentric planetoid found in the 1980's.  According to some astrologers, this planetoid symbolizes, along with the other outer planets,  the means of transcending everyday limitations.  If these limitations are seen as a wall, then Chiron symbolizes a door which allows one to walk thru' the wall to a higher level of awareness.  Also in astrological symbolism, a planet on the horizon, or rising, is believed to indicate a person, thing or event that particularly exhibits the traits associated with that planet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is my hope that these pages will exhibit some of the characteristics of these two beliefs.<BR>

<TITLE>Race Unity</TITLE>

<FONT SIZE=7><B><CENTER>Race Unity</CENTER></B></FONT><HR>

</HEAD> 

<BODY> 

Since the early 1800's, there has been a determined effort by people of good-will to eliminate attitudes of racial superiority.   This has largely been attempted through legislative action and other anti-racism campaigns.  The failure of these activities to produce amity and equality among the races suggests that such efforts, irregardless of their value, are inadequate to the task of achieving unity. <BR><BR>
It is my belief that a major problem with most efforts, however good intentioned, is that they are essentially negative in their focus; they are designed primarily not to bring about some new state, but to eliminate an old one.  The links below are to organizations and activies which focus on bringing people of the various races together in a new system of amity and friendship.<BR>

Inter-racial marriages, the ultimate display of race unity, are on the increase as shown by Census Bureau <A HREF="/~chiron_rising/race/stats.html">statistics</A>.  One of the areas of the country that has an unusually high percentage of inter-racial marriage is my home area, the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.  Ultimately, I believe, the race problem will be 'solved' by marriage.  How can you discriminate against a person because of their race when you can't tell what race they are?  Here are some other pages  on inter-racial marriages and families I have found.  They include a variety of material including information on relevant lists and UseNet groups.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=7>Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>
<BR>

</HEAD> 
The Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith is an international religion that accepts Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h as the World Redeemer promised by all the religions of the past.  In Christian terms, He is the Return of Christ; and it is the responsibility solely of Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s to bring into being a New World Order, the Kingdom of God on Earth.   <BR>
<BR>
If this is your first encounter with the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith, and you wish to read more about it, I suggest two texts on the Internet.  <I><A HREF="http://www.bcca.org/~glittle/docs/hidden.html">The Hidden Words</A></I>, a small volume by Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h  summarizes the spiritual foundations of the Faith.  <I><A HREF="http://www.bcca.org/~kalantar/writings/authors/other/off.pub.info/statement.baha/index.html">Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h</A></I>, a statement from the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; World Center in Haifa Israel is a brief biography.  <BR>
<BR>
As you read The Hidden Words, I urge you to ask yourself "Is this the Word of God, the same Word of God found in the Gospels?  And as you read of the life of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, I urge you to ask yourself "Is this the life of the returned Christ?"  If your answer to these two questions is 'YES!", then I invite you to publicly proclaim your faith in Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h by enrolling in the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community and participating in the erection of this New World Order, the Kingdom of God on Earth.<BR>
<BR>
There is a large amount of additional material on the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith on the Internet.  Two of the best places to start are <A HREF="http://www.bcca.org/srb/resources.html">Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Resources on the Internet</A> and <A HREF="http://www.bcca.org/~glittle/">A Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith Page</A>.  The material on both is similar but organized differently.  There is also a UseNet discussion group, soc.religion.bahai where you can ask questions on your concerns.  If your news server does not carry it, you may receive it by <a href=mailto:bahai-faith-request@bcca.org>subscription</a>.<BR>
<BR>
If you would like to explore a variety of sites set up by Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s, follow the <A HREF="ring.html">Bah&aacute;'&iacute;Ring.</A>  Bah&aacute;'&iacute;Ring is a collection of linked Bah&aacute;'&iacute; oriented sites which you can explore in sequence or by random jumps.<BR>

<BODY> 

We are a nationwide, nonprofit organization that enables people to obtain food in
an atmosphere of human dignity. Participants in SHARE, Self Help And Resource
Exchange, pay $14 in cash or food stamps to receive a monthly, supplemental food
package containing about 30 pounds of groceries worth $25 to $30. Each participant is
responsible for providing two hours of volunteer service sometime during the
month. SHARE operates through a network of host organizations such as places of
worship, schools, tenant groups and community centers. <BR>
<BR>
A sense of community spirit is vital to the SHARE philosophy. People of every
socioeconomic background pool their resources of time and money to stretch their
food dollars and contribute to the well-being of their communities. SHARE's vision
of community begins with the contributions of each and every individual which
adds up to thousands of hours of volunteer time.  Volunteeer service is an indispensable part of the SHARE program; without it  SHARE would not exist. Some participants contribute their time directly to the  SHARE organization at the warehouse, office, or local host site. Reaching beyond  SHARE and into the communities in which they live, participants volunteer their time and skills by visiting hospitals, delivering food to the homebound, helping at schools, day care centers, soup kitchens, libraries, places of worship, etc. <BR>
<BR>
Everyone is eligible to join SHARE. Every person, regardless of background, who
contributes his or her $14 and two hours of volunteeer service is eligible to receive
the food package. SHARE strives to maintain a package that is fresh, wholesome,
and nutritious. The contents vary each month but always include meat, fresh fruit
and vegetables and other grocery items.  SHARE is able to dramatically increase the value of each participant's $14 contribution because much of the distribution is managed by volunteers and the food is bought in large quantities directly from farms and wholesalers. <BR>

<DD>Since the early 1800's, there has been a determined effort by people of good-will to eliminate attitudes of racial superiority.   This has largely been attempted through legislative action and other anti-racism campaigns.  The failure of civil rights laws and other activities to acheive this end shows that combatting racism by itself is inadequate.  This link leads to resources and organizations on the Internet that promote the unity of the races.

This site developed on a Mac SE/30 8/720 running system 7.5 using WebWeaver 2.5.2.  I'ld be a bigger fan of Wintel machines if they could run Windows 95 on a 386 as easy as I run system 7.5 on an 030.<BR>

<BR><FONT SIZE=5><CENTER><B>Background of Race Unity Day</B></CENTER></FONT>
     Race Unity Day was inaugurated in 1957 by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s of the United States to promote racial harmony and understanding. It is sponsored annually, on the second Sunday in June, by members of the <A HREF="http:///~chiron_rising/baha'i.html">Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith</A> throughout the nation. Originally called Race Amity Day, the name was changed to Race Unity Day in 1965. <BR>
<BR>
     The purpose of this day is to focus attention on what Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s believe is the most challenging moral issue facing this country - racial prejudice. Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h, the Prophet-Founder of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith, made the oneness of humanity under God, and thus the elimination of all forms of prejudice the central point of His teachings. Expounding on this theme, the Universal House of Justice, the internationl governing body of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s, in its 1985 address to the peoples of the world, "The Promise of World Peace", cites racism as one of the major obstacles to achieving world peace:
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Racism, one of the most baneful and persistent evils,   is
a major barrier to peace. Its practice perpetrates too outrageous
a violation of the dignity of human beings to be countenanced
under any pretext. Racism retards the unfoldment of the boundless
potentialities of its victims, corrupts its perpetrators, and
blights human progress. Recognition of the oneness of mankind,
implemented by appropriate legal measures, must be universally
upheld if this problem is to be overcome."</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>MISSION STATEMENT</FONT></B></CENTER>
<BR>

The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable
unless and until its unity is firmly established.  It is of paramount
importance that we recognize our commonality as members of the human race,
that we realize the necessity for us to be able to live in our communities
(as well as the world) as one family.  It is the responsibility of each
of us to do what we can to bring about the unity of humanity.  The goal
being "Unity in Diversity."<BR>
<BR>
While we feel that the solution to the problem of racism is ultimately
spiritual, the purpose of this forum is not to teach any particular 
religion.<BR>
<BR>
<DL><DT> We believe:
<DD>  <B>1.</B> The world is a diverse place and we must learn to live together.
<DD>  <B>2.</B> Diversity is an asset that can enrich us all.
<DD>  <B>3.</B> Every person, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or economic status is a valuable part of society.
<DD>  <B>4.</B> Racism is a disease, transmitted subconsciously from parents to children in societies where it is not confronted with factual information.
<DD>  <B>5.</B>    The process of healing racism is an essential part of establishing unity among humankind.
<DD>  <B>6.</B> Our best hope is to inoculate (teach) our children against racism.
<DD>  <B>7.</B> Healing can occur through positive association with others who are different.
<DD>  <B>8.</B> Healing racism and promoting unity requires patience and understanding.
<DD>  <B>9.</B> Change and healing begin with us.

<TITLE>"Colorblindness</TITLE>
<HEAD> 

</HEAD> 

<BODY> 
 One hears the term "colorblind" used popularly in the press and by many (mainly white) Americans to describe a progressive attitude in one's social interaction with people of different "races."  The following piece, written a few years ago, attempts by using Baha'i Writings to show that however well intentioned, the term "colorblind" and similar expressions do not describe a Baha'i approach to race relations.<BR>
<BR>

  <CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=6>"COLORBLINDNESS" AND RACE UNITY</font><BR><BR>
<font size=4>ONE BAHA'I'S PERSPECTIVE</FONT></B></CENTER> 
<BR>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Don Osborn</FONT></B></CENTER><BR>


     The foundation of race unity is love of God, and recognition that He created us all from the same substance and wishes us to behave towards each other with love and fellowship and with tolerance and righteousness.  The achievement of race unity involves practical matters including how to treat racial differences that have long been misunderstood (often willfully) and made the cause for division.  Many passages in the Baha'i writings can help us in this effort, providing as they do a range of teachings relating to various situations and attitudes we may inherit.<BR><BR>

     It is helpful for us as Baha'is to periodically deepen on our Faith's teachings relating to race unity in order to improve our understanding of their import and our application of their principles.  This is especially the case as we teach the principle of the oneness of humankind and offer our community as an example of evolving race unity.<BR><BR>

     A couple of years ago during a consultation on this subject I heard a statement to the effect that we as Baha'is are seeking "racial blindness" or "blindness to racial differences" in our social interactions.  Although this did not sound quite right to me I held my peace lest I be the one mistaken and resolved to find out what the Baha'i writings actually do say about racial differences and how we are to look at them.  I felt this was important not only for my own deepening, but also because one commonly hears similar terminology used in the larger society as a positive quality.  If Baha'i teachings really do offer a different perspective on race, it is important to know what that is and how appropriately to phrase it.  I would like to share some of what I found during my personal research relating to this issue on the chance that it may be of interest to some of the Friends.<BR><BR>

     The first step I took was to divide the phrase that prompted this effort into its two parts:  "racial differences" (or differences we call racial, since there is in reality only one human race) and "blindness" (and other metaphors of lacking a sense of sight or shutting it off).  I then dealt with the latter part first, as it seemed less complex, and saved the former, which was after all the crux of the matter, for later attention.<BR><BR>

     Blindness is usually used metaphorically in a negative context in the Baha'i writings - blind in heart, inwardly blind, spiritual blindness, blind imitation, etc.  These are conditions which prevent one from perceiving the Manifestation of God and understanding His message.  Therefore, we should never seek blindness, but rather its opposite.  Indeed, Baha'u'llah gives the utmost importance to vision:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>     "In this Day whatsoever serveth to reduce blindness and
     to increase vision is worthy of consideration.  This
     vision acteth as the agent and guide for true knowledge.
     Indeed in the estimation of men of wisdom keenness of
     understanding is due to keenness of vision."  Tarazat,
     Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 35.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

     While vision is good, however, there are some ways in which we are instructed to train our faculty of sight.  For instance:  "Let your eye be chaste,..." (Lawh-i-Hikmat, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 138), and "Thine eye is My trust, suffer not the dust of vain desires to becloud its luster." (Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah, p. 322).  Closing off one's sight is used metaphorically in a positive sense in this context:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>     "O Son of Dust!  Blind thine eyes, that thou mayest
     behold My beauty; stop thine ears, that thou mayest
     hearken unto the sweet melody of my voice; empty thyself
     of all learning, that thou mayest partake of My
     knowledge; and sanctify thyself from riches, that thou
     mayest obtain a lasting share from the ocean of My
     eternal wealth.  Blind thine eyes, that is, to all save
     My beauty; stop thine ears to all save My word; empty
     thyself of all learning save the knowledge of Me; that
     with a clear vision, a pure heart and an attentive ear
     thou mayest enter the court of My holiness."  Hidden
     Words, Persian #11.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

This may be understood to mean that we should refocus our perceptions on the spiritual in order to realize our highest potential as fundamentally spiritual beings.<BR><BR>

     In the same vein, Baha'u'llah gives counsel on how to relate to each other:  "Shut your eyes to estrangement, then fix your gaze upon unity." (Kalimat-i-Firdawsiyyih, Tablets of Baha'u'llah, p. 67).  It is interesting to reflect on the parallels between the distractions of the material world and estrangement on one hand and spiritual growth and the building of unity on the other, and on how metaphors involving the faculty of sight are used in both of the last two quotes.<BR><BR>

     The writings on racial differences appear at first to be a little less straightforward, as they seem to instruct us both to see racial differences as beautiful and to not look at them.<BR><BR>

     `Abdu'l-Baha for instance compared differences in color and other aspects of physical appearance among humans to the variety found in a garden and elsewhere in nature.  Such diversity, He said, is beautiful to behold, indeed more pleasing than homogeneity, and should not be the cause of disunity.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>     "Let us look rather at the beauty in diversity, the
     beauty of harmony, and learn a lesson from the vegetable
     creation.  If you behold a garden in which all the plants
     were the same as to form, color and perfume, it would not
     seem beautiful to you at all, but, rather, monotonous and
     dull.  The garden which is pleasing to the eye and which
     makes the heart glad, is the garden in which are growing
     side by side flowers of every hue, form and perfume, and
     the joyous contrast of color is what makes for charm and
     beauty. ...</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>     "The diversity in the human family should be the cause of
     love and harmony, as it is in music where many different
     notes blend together in making the perfect chord.  If you
     meet those of different race and color from yourself, do
     not mistrust them and withdraw into your shell of
     conventionality, but rather be glad and show them
     kindness.  Think of them as different colored roses
     growing in the beautiful garden of humanity, and rejoice
     to be among them."  Paris Talks, pp. 52-3.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>     "In the realm of existence colors are of no importance...
     In the vegetable kingdom the colors are not the cause of
     discord.  Rather, colors are the cause of the adornment
     of the garden because a single color has no appeal; but
     when you observe many colored flowers, there is charm and
     display.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>     "The world of humanity, too, is like a garden, and
     humankind are like the many-colored flowers.  Therefore,
     different colors constitute an adornment."  The
     Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 45.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>

     On the other hand, Baha'u'llah tells us "Close your eyes to racial differences and welcome all with the light of unity" (quoted by Shoghi Effendi in The Advent of Divine Justice, p. 37).  And 'Abdu'l-Baha elaborates:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>     "Let them look not upon a man's color but upon his heart.
     If the heart be filled with light, that man is nigh unto
     the threshold of his Lord; but if not, that man is
     careless of his Lord, be he white or black."  (Selections
     from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Baha, p. 113).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>

     If racial differences are beautiful, then why are we instructed to shut our eyes to them in order to be able to achieve unity?  Perhaps these passages counsel us not to consider racial differences as distinguishing characteristics and to focus instead on what unifies us.  That unifying factor would be our spiritual reality.  It is certainly significant for the context of this discussion that we are told to close off and redirect our sight rather than to strive for sightlessness or "blindness."  What is prescribed is the action of training our perception rather than a state of impairment or absence of perception.<BR><BR>

     However, noting the similarity between the passages beginning "Shut your eyes to estrangement..." and "Close your eyes to racial differences...," one must ask if there are any ways in which racial differences themselves may still be viewed as barriers to unity?  Perhaps racial differences are comparable in some ways to material goods.  We are permitted to enjoy material things but not to the point where they come between us and God.  Similarly, racial differences are in no way a problem unless we allow them to prevent unity.<BR><BR>

     Differences that we call racial have, of course, historically been one of the major factors defining lines of division among peoples.  These differences, however, have not been the cause of racism.  It is misunderstanding of the differences that has been at the root of racism. The answer, ultimately, is not to try to ignore them but to learn to see them for what they are and are not.<BR><BR>

     The answer, then, is not "racial blindness" or "color blindness."  Nor is it the means to achieve race unity.  Not even for individuals in early stages of overcoming racism should this terminology be used, and it should never ever be used to describe Baha'i teachings on race unity.  What we are seeking is, as was so nicely put in The Vision of Race Unity, "to look at the racial situation with new eyes."<BR><BR>

     Diversity in appearance should be a source of joy to a unified humanity, just as variety in cultural traditions should be a source of strength to it.  Ultimately, however, they are insignificant, as it is what is in the heart and how we relate to God that is important.  By recognizing that the fundamental human reality is found on the spiritual level we can appreciate the diversity in which God created us and "discern with the eye of oneness His glorious handiwork..."<P>

<DL><DT> Thou must endeavor that they intermarry.  There is no greater means to bring about affection between the white and the black than the influence of the Word of God.  Likewise marriage between these two races will wholly destroy and eradicate the root of enmity.
<DD>('Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;,<I>The Power of Unity</I>, p55, #17; cited in <I>The Pupil of the Eye</I>, p75, #6)
</DL>
O ye two who have believed in Him!<BR>
<DL><DT> ...I pray God that ye may at all times be in the utmost love and harmony, and be a cause of the spirituality of the human world.  This union will unquestionably promote love and affection between the black and the white, and will affect and encourage others.  These two races will unite and merge together, and there will appear and take root a new generation sound in health and beauteous in countenance.
<DD>('Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;,<I>The Power of Unity</I>, p55, #18; cited in <I>The Pupil of the Eye</I>, p75, #7)
</DL>
<DL><DT> In marriage the more distant the blood-relationship the better, for such distance in family ties between husband and wife provides the basis for the well-being of humanity and is conducive to fellowship among mankind.
<DD>('Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, <I>The Power of Unity</I>, p55, #19; cited in <I>The Pupil of the Eye</I>, p64, #7)
</DL>
<DL><DT> Your statement to the effect that the principle of the oneness of mankind prevents any true Bah&aacute;'&iacute; from regarding race itself as a bar to union is in complete accord with the Teachings of the Faith on this point.  For both Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h and 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; never disaproved of the idea of interracial marriage, nor discouraged it.  The Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Teachings, indeed, by their very nature transcend all limitations imposed by race, and as such can [sic] and should never be identified with any particular school of racial philosophy.
<DD>(On behalf of Shoghi Effendi, 1/27/35 to National Spritual Assembly of Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s of the United States and Canada, published in <I>Bah&aacute;'&iacute; News</I>, no. 90, Mar 1935; cited in <I>The Power of Unity</I>, p55, #20)
</DL>
<DL><DT> The Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s should welcome the Negroes to their homes, make every effort to teach them, associate with them, even marry them if they want to.  We must remember that 'Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; Himself united in Bah&aacute;'&iacute; mariage a colored and a white believer.  He could not do more.
<DD>(On behalf of Shoghi Effendi, 5/27/57 to  Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Inter-racial Teaching Committee, cited in <I>To Move the World</I>, p294; cited in <I>The Power of Unity</I>, p56, #21)
</DL>
<DL><DT> With regard to the problem of intermarriage between the Zoroastrian and Hindu Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s, this is a highly delicate and vital question, as important as the problem of the black and white in America.  The friends should all realize that racial considerations do not, in the light of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Teachings, constitute any hindrance to any kind of intercourse between the believers.  The Hindu and Zoroastrian Bah&aacute;'&iacute;s should forget their former and traditional prejudices whether religious, racial or social, and commune together on a common basis of equality, love and devotion to the Cause.  While the goal is quite clear yet, wisdom and caution are needed in order to carry this ideal into full practice.
<DD>(Shoghi Effendi, 4/17/36 to an individual believer, <I>Dawn of a New Day</I>, p198; cited in <I>The Power of Unity</I>, p56, #22)
</DL>
<DL><DT> God's wisdom hath decreed that partners to a marriage should be of distant origins.  That is, the further removed the relationship between the husband and wife is, the stronger, the more beautiful and healthy will their offspring be.
<DD>('Abdul-Bah&aacute;, <I>The Pupil of the Eye</I>, p64, #8)

<TITLE>Iowa and Indianola</TITLE>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>A Bit About Iowa With Some Links</FONT></B></CENTER><HR NOSHADE>

<BODY> 
Admittedly, I'm prejudiced.  I like Iowa, including the seasons.  I currently live in Indianola, about 20 miles south of Des Moines, capital of Iowa.  Tho' Iowa is often tho't of as some kind of backwater, as most people now realize, the first working modern computer was developed at Iowa State, about 50 miles north of here.  And practically every town in the state has local dial-up access to the I'net, thanks to a cooperative venture of the independent telephone companies.  <BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.indianola.ia.us/chamber/">Indianola, Iowa</A>, a town of about 12,000, is known for it's park system, <A HREF="http://www.simpson.edu/">Simpson College</A>, the Des Moines Metro Opera, and the annual National Balloon Classic.<BR>
<BR>
For a run down on Iowa, go to <A HREF="http://www.profiles.iastate.edu/">Iowa PROfiles</A>, a service of Iowa State University.  But if you really want to know what Iowa is all about, browse the <A HREF="http://www.profiles.iastate.edu/places/attract.htm">Iowa attractions</A> file there for events and attractions in the towns across the state.  <BR>
My favorite is Calkins Nature Area, listed under Iowa Falls.  It is a 78 acre environmental education center being developed jointly by Ellsworth College and the Hardin County Conservation Board on land donated to the Ellsworth Trustees by my family.  This fall a combination classroom/museum will open to the public displaying the wildlife exhibit from the 1892 Chicago World's Fair.  <BR>

<BODY> 
Chiron was a character in Greek mythology.  There are a number of versions of the story, so you may find one that differs somewhat from the one I tell here.<BR>
<BR>
Chiron was the last king of the Centaurs, the race that preceded man.  He saw the rise of man and realized that the Centaur was doomed; that man would replace them.  He also knew the history of the Centaur, how hard and long they had struggled to attain the level of civilization they had.  He decided that he would help mankind by providing  some of the information that had taken the Centaur generations to learn.  <BR>
<BR>
This decision made the gods angry, and Zeus had him killed.  Chiron became the first martyr to the new race of men.  Later, Zeus repented and gave him a place among the stars; he is what we call the constellation of Sagitarius.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Chiron is also the name of an eccentric planetoid found in the 1980's.  According to some astrologers, this planetoid symbolizes, along with the other outer planets,  the means of transcending everyday limitations.  If these limitations are seen as a wall, then Chiron symbolizes a door which allows one to walk thru' the wall to a higher level of awareness.  Also in astrological symbolism, a planet on the horizon, or rising, is believed to indicate a person, thing or event that particularly exhibits the traits associated with that planet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is my hope that these pages will exhibit some of the characteristics of these two beliefs.<BR>

<PRE> 
  OLSEN:   What's the difference between synthetic THC and 
natural THC? 
 
  MCKINNEY:   Molecularly speaking, there's no difference at all.   
The only difference between getting THC out of the plant, is when 
you get it out of the plant, the residuals, the impurities, are 
all these dismissive molecules, which are other plant molecules, 
of course.   When you make synthetic THC, the only residual 
impurity, quote-unquote, is delta-8 THC, so Marinol's technically 
95% THC and 5% delta-8 THC, whereas marijuana is 5% THC and 95% 
plant material which apparently has no effect, because every time 
people give all this testimony and talk about the effects of 
smoking marijuana, or whatever, whenever they talk about the 
effects, the effects are identical from the effects of taking 
THC. 
 
  OLSEN:   You said there's never been any ..., you know, when 
people talk about marijuana, they're talking about THC, because 
none of the other chemicals have ever been tested. 
 
  MCKINNEY:   Exactly.  Well, it's not that they haven't been 
tested, they've been tested, but there's been no real indication 
that they have an effect to the extent that it changes the effect 
of smoking marijuana.  In other words, there's never been a test 
on any of the other drugs that are in marijuana that indicated 
they have dramatic enough effects that they would be changing the 
effect of THC.  Say, maybe, there was, you know, 2% water in your 
orange juice, it wouldn't do a lot of difference to the orange 
juice.  It would be slightly diluted, but you wouldn't taste any 
difference, and you wouldn't feel any difference.  So, what's 
happening is, the government charges, which are totally specious, 
is that there are these other things in marijuana, sure, but not 
one of these other things in marijuana has been shown to be 
dangerous or problematical, nor has it ever been shown that those 
experiencing the effects of marijuana are experiencing the 
effects of anything else but THC. 
 
  OLSEN:   What about the argument that smoking marijuana is bad 
because it's smoke? 
 
  MCKINNEY:   That, per se, is silly, because the National Cancer 
Institute will tell you that unless you smoke more than four 
cigarettes a day, there's no determination that you're moving 
towards lung damage, and very few people are smoking more than 
four joints a day. 
 
  OLSEN:  Is there anything different about marijuana smoke than 
tobacco smoke 
 
  MCKINNEY:  No.  Actually, marijuana does have a slightly 
tarrier smoke.  It's about 30% to 40% tarrier, but, again, we go 
down to how many joints a day. 
 
  OLSEN:  What about the bronchodilator and bronchoconstrictor 
things? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  That has to do with the effects of THC on the smooth 
muscle.  Initially, it acts as a stimulator, which causes smooth 
muscle to contract, which gives you that feeling of your 
diaphragm getting tight, or people say that smoke is expanding.  
That's ridiculous.  Smoke is not expanding their diaphragm, it's 
contracting.  It's because it effects all smooth muscle 
immediately, making it contract. 
 
  OLSEN:  Well, they say marijuana's like a bronchodilator, and 
tobacco is a bronchoconstrictor. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Who say? 
 
  OLSEN:  I've read this over and over again. 
 
  MCKINNEY:   Yeah, well, there's a lot of things.  People used 
to say you could bury your dope in the ground, it would get full 
of mold and everything.  There's a lot of bullshit around in this 
business, because there's so many people 
 
  OLSEN:  I've also heard that it was good for migraines, because 
it expanded the blood vessels in the brain. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Well, that's complete bullshit, because there's 
nothing that's going to give you a headache faster than expanding 
the blood vessels in the brain.  In fact, the two kinds of 
headaches that we normally have, one is caused by constriction of 
the muscles in the neck which drops the blood pressure in the 
brain, the other is caused by exhaustion which by making the 
smooth muscles relax ... 
 
  OLSEN:  Well, it was described to me as the migraine or the 
headache comes from constricting of the blood vessels, cutting 
off the supply of oxygen to the brain. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  No.  No, not at all.  If you cut off the blood 
supply to the brain, you'd be dead.  It just drops the blood 
pressure slightly. 
 
  OLSEN:  Well, just restricting the flow, I mean, somewhat. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Restricting the flow drops the blood pressure, 
doesn't it? 
 
  OLSEN:  I don't know. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Well, let's face it.  You've got X amount of blood 
pressure, and you put less blood in.  Come on. 
 
  OLSEN:  Yeah.  I don't know.  It was described to me as being a 
reduction in oxygen. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  By a licensed physician who had a knowledge of 
cardiovascular things, or some marijuana advocate?  Let's get 
straight here.  Who are we talking to, experts or Merlins? 
 
  OLSEN:  No.  I just heard this.  I'm just checking it out. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Don't believe a thing you hear, unless the guy who 
is saying it . 
 
  OLSEN:  Well, I don't believe a thing I hear.  I repeat it as 
being something I heard, and that's all the value I give it. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Between you and me, I won't pass along anything.  
Ever since I've been in the drug education business, since 1970, 
I always check it out with the medical journals before I repeat 
anything. 
 
  OLSEN:  Well, of course, well, I just thought I'd check with 
you, since you're that kind of a person. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Well, here's the word.  THC from a plant and THC 
from a vat are absolutely identical.  However, since that's the 
case, and since no one smoking marijuana has ever described the 
symptoms of smoking marijuana as being different from those of 
having an effect of THC, we are really putting people in jail for 
an alternative administration of a legal drug, and that's what I 
keep saying.  If you vaporize a plant to get your THC molecules, 
even though they re mixed with a lot of other crap, sure, it's 
ineffective, but it's simply an alternative mode of 
administration.  And the Drug Enforcement Administration has to 
admit that people smoking marijuana are self-medicating 
themselves with THC.  And if you talk about self-medication, 
instead of getting high, and you talked about self-medication 
with crude THC, rather than smoking a doobie, now you re talking 
about using this wonder drug that everyone says is so safe. 
 
  OLSEN:  Yeah.  Yeah, OK, tell me now, what are the two 
chemicals that are used to make THC synthetically. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Olivitol and paramenthadianol , And you react the 
two, and I'm not certain how you react the two, I mean, that's 
the part I don't know.  Do you put it in a pressure cooker?  Do 
you put it in a special apparatus?  Do you do this?  Do you do 
that?  I'm not sure.  But you react the two together.  It is 
being done at Norac Industries owned by Chester, Dr.  Chester, 
McCluskey in Azusa, California.  I mean, this is something that 
ought to he fun.  You could get a sort of a tour of the lab.  You 
could get all the marijuana activists out to Azusa and stand 
around the place where they make the THC. 
 
  OLSEN:  Yeah.  I'm interested in where they get these two 
chemicals from, too. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  They get it from Sandoz in New Jersey. 
 
  OLSEN:  And do you have any idea how Sandoz gets it? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  They make it. 
 
  OLSEN:  OK.  And do you have any idea how they make it? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Yeah, from a lot of other stuff.  I think they start 
with gallac acid.  I'm not certain, but I think they start with 
gallac acid.  I'm not sure, but the thing is, someone told me ...  
Carl Nocka is the man who makes it. 
 
  OLSEN:  OK.  Got his address? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Carl Nocka is the man who makes the olivitol for 
Sandoz.  I believe it's Sandoz, in their chemical division.  He 
describes the process of making olivitol as mouse milk. 
 
  OLSEN:  OK.  Is there any way I could find out from this guy, 
or from anybody else, exactly where the organic compounds come 
from?  What do they start out with?  Where do they get the plant 
material or the mineral material? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  There's no plant material. 
 
  OLSEN:  Well, where do they get the minerals from then, to 
start this whole process? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Well, they usually get them out of the ground. 
 
  OLSEN:  Yeah.  And what are they?  What are the minerals? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Well, it comes down to probably atoms of carbon and 
nitrogen, and things like that.  You see, when you talk about 
biosynthesis, it means the plant, using its own clever bits of 
iona this and iona that, is shifting the molecules back and 
forth.  Let's also recall that the plant doesn't make 
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it makes tetrahydrocannabinolic acid 
and then it has to be decarboxylated by heat.  Now, the other way 
of making THC is to make cannabidiol and then reverse isomerize 
it, which the isomerizer never did do, into THC.  That's the 
Razdan process.  You see, the thing is, that when you're making 
THC, if you let the reaction go too far, you end up with 
cannabidiol.  And, what the Razdan process locked into, the fact 
was, take it all the way to cannabidiol and then turn the 
cannabidiol into THC.  That's how they do Razdan THC, which is 
the stuff that Harry Pars wanted to put on the market.  Remember, 
THC can be made by anybody for nausea, it can't be made by anyone 
else excepting Unimed for weight gain. 
 
  OLSEN:  OK.  Why? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Why?  Because they got an orphan drug from the 
United States government, a monopoly.  That's why this whole 
thing started.  Kapoor, an Indian fellow with $200 million, took 
over Unimed and then he got an orphan drug for weight gain, and 
pushed forward with a lot of government pressure, and they opened 
up the market in Europe by having the UN change their OKs on THC. 
 
  OLSEN:  OK.  What's an orphan drug? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Orphan drug means when a drug supposedly has so 
little market that making the ..., the expense of creating an FDA 
passable version of the drug would exceed the money that a person 
was going to make from it.  It's called an orphan drug.  That 
means that nobody really wants to make it, because it's not 
profitable enough.  So, in order to induce a company to make an 
orphan drug, the government gives one company a monopoly.  So, 
Unimed has a monopoly.  The interesting thing about Unimed is 
that it's owned by an Indian named John Kapoor who lives in 
Chicago, but it's distributed by Roxane Laboratories which is 
wholly, privately, owned by the German drug cartel Boehringer-
Ingelheim, which means that the profits from this drug are going 
to Germany.  And, the people who make the olivitol are Sandoz.  
It's a Swiss company.  So, the profits from the manufacture of 
the raw ingredients go to Switzerland.  All the money from this 
wonderful drug goes out of the United States, increasing our 
deficit.  If we grew it in this country and made it, it would be 
American THC.  This is sold by the Germans, with ingredients made 
by the Swiss.  And we could do it all ourselves.  The original 
work was done by Arthur D. Little and was picked up by Unimed 
back in 1983, because no one else wanted to make it.  The 
capsules are made by Banner Laboratories in Los Angeles.  So, the 
THC, pure THC, is shipped from Norac to Banner, Banner puts it 
into capsules and ships it to the Cleveland, Ohio, warehouse of 
Roxane Laboratories. 
 
  OLSEN:  How do you think that the government can keep marijuana 
illegal then? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Well, because, you see, the law, as was written by 
John Mitchell, is the Controlled Substances Act.  If it was the 
Controlled Drug Act, we'd have a real problem, because in modern 
day we don't think of a drug as being a collection of substances, 
but as being a specific molecule.  But, by calling it a 
Controlled Substances Act, you can play all sorts of legal 
rubbery games like saying that cocaine is in Schedule 2, because 
there's a medical use for cocaine, but crack is in Schedule 1. 
 
  OLSEN:  And the coca plant is in Schedule 2. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Yes.  But, what I'm trying to point out is, although 
cocaine is in Schedule 2, and they can't get it out of Schedule 
2, to make more money for the police and the Justice Department, 
crack is in Schedule 1, which means there is no medical 
intervention, it's all in the hands of the police, although, 
chemically speaking, crack and cocaine are precisely the same.  
It's simply another form of it.  And that's why I say you have 
the Controlled Substances Act.  That's how you can have the 
entire peyote plant in that category, or the entire marijuana 
plant, because it's a substance.  THC is in Schedule 2.  
Marijuana is in Schedule 1.  It's in Schedule I supposedly 
because it contains a drug called THC which is in Schedule 2.  
However, if you take the THC out of marijuana, it's still in 
Schedule 1, even though its got its drug taken out of it, because 
it's the marijuana that's the controlled substance, and that is 
the trick to a controlled substance.  They could make Scotch Tape 
into a controlled substance. 
 
  OLSEN:  Why is marijuana then, without THC, in Schedule I and 
tobacco is legal? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Because, in Schedule I in the Controlled Substances 
Act they define a number of different items, and marijuana is 
defined as the leaves and the flowering tops and everything made 
of the marijuana plant.  That's the legal definition. 
 
  OLSEN:  But how can you call it due process, I mean, how is it 
fair that a classification include something and doesn't include 
something else, when they both fit the same definition? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  No one ever said the body of law in any country is 
particularly good.  In Arabia, they chop your head off.  I mean, 
let's face it, the laws are never anything but the current 
reflection of popular political opinion.  So, what you're looking 
at here is a drug which is itself, at 95%, considered to be a 
wonder drug, safe, never been an overdose.  OK?  But, at 5% in a 
plant, it's in the same category as heroin.  In other words, when 
it's 20 or 30 times more potent, it's legal.  But, when it's so 
crude, when it's in its crudest form, it's like saying gasoline 
and crude oil ... 
 
  OLSEN:  Well, aren't they saying, because of the fact that it's 
only 5% and it's mixed with all this other stuff, that that's why 
it's worse that the 95% pure? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Well, what they're saying, whenever you try to make 
marijuana into Schedule 2, is that there are all these other 
things which haven't been tested.  They make you put marijuana 
through the same test you'd put THC through, which is to say, 
what are the impurities?," and of course there are 423 molecules 
in marijuana, only one of them is THC.  So, if you take out the 
THC, how many impurities have you got?  422.  That's how they do 
it.  Because, normally, when you make a drug, you've got to test 
the impurities and see if they're OK, and see if they have any 
effect.  Can you imagine anyone wanting to test 422 other 
molecules?  Now, the only thing I have, there's been a change in 
the generic drug laws that says you don't have to duplicate the 
entire procedure, but you do have to make it equivalent, its got 
to have the same effect.  And when the FDA told us that they 
didn't care where you got THC from, as long as it was 95% pure, 
there was some question there.  But what it comes right down to 
is that nobody in the marijuana movement, including Richard 
Dennis, wants to put their money behind the one simple routine 
that would change everything, which I've been talking about for 
the last four years, which is a very simple movement to change 
the definition of marijuana in the rule books.  All you have to 
do is include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as one of the legal 
products of the plant, along with hemp seed and hemp cloth and 
hemp this and hemp that, and the whole thing would fall apart 
immediately, because then you would have the anomaly of a plant 
which had its active ingredient removed still being in Schedule 
1.  It would fall apart on its own ridiculousness.  And yet ... 
 
  OLSEN:  In other words, you're saying that it would be looked 
at like tobacco? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Yeah.  I mean, it wouldn't be looked at like 
tobacco.  Suppose that you had a lemon, and vitamin C was legal, 
but lemons were illegal because they had vitamin C, and a lemon 
was defined as everything that comes off the lemon tree. 
 
  OLSEN:  Yeah.  Well, you re saying marijuana is illegal because 
it has THC in it. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  I'm saying that the way that the government keeps 
marijuana illegal is by broadcasting the idea that marijuana 
contains a dangerous drug.  The dangerous drug they refer to is 
THC at 5%.  On the other side of their mouth, they're calling THC 
a safe and harmless drug at 95%.  In other words, when the THC is 
in sesame oil, which is the only other ingredient in Marinol, 
surrounded by a gelatin capsule, it's a wonder drug.  When the 
THC is in a hemp stalk, surrounded by hemp fibers, it's Schedule 
I criminal, and how it would be illegal for us to hack our way 
into there and pull the legal drug out.  You see, to us, to our 
way of thinking, and our argument all along, we're going into a 
plant to pull out something legal, and we're calling the plant 
illegal because its got the legal stuff in it.  It doesn't make 
any sense.  You can simply say that the people smoking marijuana 
are self-medicating themselves with the effects of THC, which are 
found by the government to be safe, efficacious, and absolutely 
harmless.  There's never been an overdose, there's never been a 
death.  And they're just people who have, you know, nausea maybe?  
Who knows, maybe they want to gain weight.  Fine, let them self-
medicate.  Why can't they medicate by taking it out of the plant?  
It's like saying you've got to have pure synthetic maple syrup, 
you can't tap a tree. 
 
  OLSEN:  So, is there another way to get THC out of marijuana 
besides smoking it, and without refining it? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  No. 
 
  OLSEN:  Is there some way to use the raw marijuana at home, 
does it have to go through some ... 
 
  MCKINNEY:  You can't get pure THC out of it. 
 
  OLSEN:  You can't? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  You can't.  No.  You can get maybe a solution as 
high as 65% or 75%, you can.  That's about as high as you con go.  
The reason it costs nearly as much to make natural THC is because 
there's so much more gunk to clear out with the liquid 
chromatograms.  When you've only got two molecules to separate, 
it's not so hard.  When you've got 400 to separate, it's harder. 
 
  OLSEN:  It would be more expensive to make THC from a plant 
than it would be to ...? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  As expensive.  Until you get into serious large 
production, there's no real advantage.  The one thing that's the 
biggest advantage is you don't have to rely on a lot of complex 
expensive chemicals made by a lot of complex expensive companies.  
When Carl Nocka said that making olivitol was mouse milk, what he 
meant was it takes a hell of a lot of whatever they use to make 
it out of to make a little bit.  It's a very low yield process.  
That's why olivitol costs $1,000 a kilogram.  Very expensive.  
Now, in the making of THC from the raw materials, it costs a lot 
more to refine it, but the raw materials are cheaper.  You see, 
the liquid chromatogram uses packed columns of silica gel which 
will retard certain molecules and let other molecules go through.  
And what happens is that it retards the cannabinoids say, but 
then eventually the little granules in the tube become all 
clogged up with what they're trying to sieve out.  And the 
problem is because there's so many similar molecules to THC in 
the gunk, that you can't run the solution through the tubes more 
than two or three times and it's all gunked up.  And, silica gel 
costs $150 to $250 a kilogram.  It's like sand.  It's specially 
treated sand, for all intents and purposes.  But the fact is, 
it's expensive, and when you have a synthetic, which only has 
delta-9 and delta-8, you can see it's a lot easier to separate 
them.  Still, the most expensive part of making the synthetic is 
separating the delta-9 so you end up with a 95% solution. 
 
  OLSEN:  You have to do this no matter how you make it, right? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  You always have to go to the liquid chromatogram for 
the last stage.  The thing is, when you make it synthetically, 
you end up with an 80% solution, and there are only two molecules 
in that solution.  In the making of natural , you end up with a 
75% solution, 25% of which is made up of 420 different other 
things.  However, generically speaking, this may not be as 
important if it's shown that tests have no differences in the 
effect.  The only reason that Perdue-Frederick dropped that is 
because there wasn't enough sales of the synthetic.  Otherwise, 
they would have backed us with the natural. 
 
  OLSEN:  They would have kept testing? 
 
  MCKINNEY:   They would have backed us with the natural.  They 
didn't test.  They never got to that stage.  But the funny thing 
is that, of course, if they push the synthetic enough, or course, 
other people will come in line and start working with the 
natural, hopefully.  And, if they're going to make the natural, 
they're going to have to make it out of the plant, and the plant 
will have to drop to Schedule 2, as all precursors of Schedule 2 
drugs have to be in the same schedule.  You can't have a 
precursor of a drug in a higher schedule than the drug itself. 
 
  OLSEN:  What is a precursor?  You mean the plant? 
 
  MCKINNEY:  The plant, the poppy. 
 
  OLSEN:  The coca plant? 
 
  MCKINNEY:   Yeah.  The poppy plant is in Schedule 2, opium 
poppy.  And, if, say, for instance, if mescaline became legal, 
they'd have to put peyote in Schedule 2 for the same reason.  And 
that's why I keep saying, if we can only get natural THC into 
Schedule 2, it would force marijuana into Schedule 2.  But the 
nutniks in the marijuana reform movement are all a bunch of ex-
hippies sitting around rolling doobies on the back porch and 
gazing at the sun and saying, "Oh wow!"  They're not realizing 
there are two important things to do.  First, it's very easy to 
change the definition if it looks like you're doing it to keep 
marijuana away from people.  And by simply slipping in a 
definitional change in the marijuana definition in the law, state 
by state, you can slip that through the legislatures with no one 
getting excited, because they wouldn't understand what you were 
really doing.  It sounds like you're, you know, bringing the 
definition up to date, because in 1985 THC became legal, 
therefore, THC is defined as the psychoactive drug in marijuana, 
and that's the way it's defined in the Physician's Desk 
Reference, the PDR. 
 
  OLSEN:  Well, you know, Iowa's law says that marijuana's in 
both Schedule I and Schedule 2.  Schedule I says it has no 
medical use, and Schedule 2 says it does, and what you just said 
would be a way to solve, to make the Iowa law make sense and 
accomplish exactly what they tried to accomplish without making 
it look like a bunch of idiots wrote it. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  You can change the definition so that marijuana is 
illegal, excepting for the products, and one of those products 
would be pure, it could be pharmaceutically pure THC. 
 
  OLSEN:  Which would be Schedule 2. 
 
  MCKINNEY:  Yeah.  Now, the legislatures and the lawmakers know 
if anyone wouldn't realize what they were doing by changing that 
to make it clear that only pharmaceutically pure THC from the 
marijuana plant would be considered legal, but the rest of it's 
no good, it sounds like you're making it impossible for someone 
to do this, but whet they are doing is that they're making 
marijuana the precursor of a legal drug.

     Post Office Box 4091  
     Des Moines, Iowa 50333  
     July 21, 1992  

Robert C. Bonner, Administrator  
Drug Enforcement Administration  
Washington, D.C. 20537  

Dear Mr. Bonner:  

     I just finished reading your decision on the Marijuana 
Rescheduling Petition, 57 FR 10499 (March 26, 1992).  Your 
explanation of the scheduling criteria in the Controlled 
Substances Act (CSA) left me confused.  By your definition, a 
substance in Schedule II is a scientifically established chemical 
compound capable of reproduction in standardized dosages.  Of 
course, marijuana is not such a substance, it is a plant, not a 
drug.  

     Although you made no mention of the fact, the coca plant, 
from which cocaine is made, and the opium plant, from which 
morphine and heroin are made, are both in Schedule II of the CSA.  
As I was reading your decision, I wondered how these two plants 
can be in Schedule II.  These plants are subject to the same 
variances in chemistry as the marijuana plant.  It seems like you 
are treating marijuana unfairly.  

     If Congress intended to rely on scientifically established 
chemistry and reproducible dosages, why did Congress include the 
coca and opium plants in Schedule II?  

     It seems to me that these plants should not be included in 
the CSA at all, because they will never fit into your definition 
of drugs, and I think your definition is correct as far as it 
goes.  However, since Congress has decided to include them in the 
CSA, your definition is inadequate to explain them.  I hope you 
will correct your definition, and not simply ignore this apparent 
inconsistency.  

     Thank you for your attention.  

     Sincerely,  
     Carl Eric Olsen

August 17, 1992  

Dear Mr. Olsen:  

     This is in response to your letter of July 21, 1992, 
regarding my decision with respect to the Marijuana Rescheduling 
Petition.  

     Your letter correctly states that one of the factors to be 
considered in determining whether a substance has a currently 
accepted medical use in treatment is that it is a scientifically 
established chemical compound capable of reproduction in 
standardized dosages.  While you are also correct in noting that 
Congress placed coca and opium plant materials in Schedule II, 
your attempt to analogize those substances to marijuana, and to 
find inconsistency in their scheduling, fails.  

     In placing coca leaves and opium plant material in Schedule 
II, Congress was very much aware that these plant materials have 
historically been recognized as the source for a variety of 
accepted and useful medications.  Neither of these plants are 
used medicinally as plant material.  In both instances, the 
medically active alkaloids are extracted from the plant material 
after which pharmaceutical compounds capable of reproduction in 
standardized dosages are produced.  These compounds are the 
medications which may then be lawfully marketed in the United 
States.  While indigenous populations in various parts of the 
world brew coca teas, chew coca leaves, and smoke opium for 
various purposes, these practices are not permitted in the United 
States under the Controlled Substances Act.  

     Unlike pharmaceuticals derived from opium and coca leaves, 
the petition to reschedule marijuana did not involve the 
scheduling of any medically useful compound to be extracted from 
the plant material.  Instead, the petition involved unsupported 
claims for the medical use of smoked marijuana.  There is, 
therefore, no inconsistency in my finding that such claims did 
not make a case for accepted medical use in treatment in the 
United States.  

     Very truly yours,  

     Robert C. Bonner  
     Administrator of Drug Enforcement

Robert C. Bonner, Administrator  
DrugEnforcement Administration  
Washington, D.C. 20537  

Dear Mr. Bonner:  

     Carl Eric Olsen hereby petitions the Administrator to 
reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 
Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to Section 201 of the 
CSA, Public Law 91-513, 21 U.S.C.  811 and 21 C.F.R.  1307.03.  

     Attached hereto and constituting a part of this petition is 
a statement of the grounds upon which petitioner relies for the 
proposed rescheduling.  

     Five copies of this petition are provided pursuant to 21 
C.F.R.  1308.44(b).  

     All notices regarding this petition should be addressed to:

     PETITIONER'S STATEMENT OF GROUNDS FOR RESCHEDULING 
 
     The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C.  801 et 
seq., contains five schedules, the first of which (Schedule I) 
contains substances which have no medical use in treatment in the 
United States, and the final four of which (Schedules II through 
V) contain substances which have medical use in treatment in the 
United States but which are available only by a physician's 
prescription.  Marijuana is currently in Schedule I of the CSA. 

     On March 26, 1992, the Administrator made a final decision 
in a marijuana rescheduling petition, DEA No. 86-22, rejecting 
the finding of an administrative law judge that marijuana has 
medical use in treatment in the United States, and rejecting the 
administrative law judge's recommendation that marijuana be moved 
to Schedule II of the CSA.  57 FR 10499. 

     The essence of the decision was that marijuana is a plant 
and not a drug.  The Administrator argued that the chemistry of 
the marijuana plant is complex, varies from plant to plant, and 
is incapable of reproduction in standardized dosages (attributes 
common to all plants), and that a drug is a scientifically 
established chemical compound capable of reproduction in 
standardized dosages. 

     The Administrator's decision has been appealed to the United 
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia by several 
parties seeking medical access to marijuana plants. 

     According to the Administrator, "the petition to reschedule 
marijuana did not involve the scheduling of any medically useful 
compound to be extracted from the plant material."  The 
Administrator went on the say, "the petition involved unsupported 
claims for medical use of smoked marijuana."  See Exhibit A. 

     As for other plants in Schedule II, the Administrator said, 
"In placing coca leaves and opium plant material in Schedule II, 
Congress was very much aware that these plant materials have 
historically been recognized as the source for a variety of 
accepted and useful medications."  The Administrator went on to 
say, "Neither of these plants are used medicinally as plant 
material."  See Exhibit A. 

     It must follow from the Administrator's explanation that 
marijuana need not have an accepted medical use in treatment in 
the United States in order to be rescheduled from Schedule I to 
Schedule II of the CSA, it only needs to be shown that marijuana 
is a source for an accepted and useful medication. 

     On October 11, 1985, the Administrator proposed to 
reschedule dronabinol to Schedule II of the CSA.  50 FR 42186 
(October 18, 1985); 21 C.F.R.  1308.12(f)(1) (1991).  Dronabinol 
is the synthetic equivalent of the isomer of delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol which is the principle psychoactive 
substance present in Cannabis Sativa L., marijuana.  50 FR 42186 
(October 18, 1985). 

     Dronabinol is the U.S. Adopted Name (USAN) for the substance 
(6aR-trans)-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-
dibenzo [b,d] pyran-1-ol or (-)-delta-9-(trans)-
tetrahydrocannabinol, the principle psychoactive substance in 
Cannabis sativa L., marijuana.  50 FR 42186 (October 18, 1985).  
It has the empirical formula C21H30O2 with molecular weight of 
314.45.  1989 Physician's Desk Reference, page 1859.   

     On May 24, 1991, the United Nations Economic and Social 
Council (ESCOR) rescheduled delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol from 
Schedule I to Schedule II of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic 
Substances.  U.N. Doc. E/CN.7/1991/26.  Report of the Commission 
on Narcotic Drugs on its thirty-fourth session, U.N. Doc. 
E/1991/24, Supp. No. 4.  The United States is a party to that 
international convention pursuant to the Psychotropic Substances 
Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-633, November 10, 1978).  50 FR 42186 
(October 18, 1985). 

     Since marijuana is now a source for an accepted and useful 
medication, it must now be moved from Schedule I to Schedule II 
of the CSA. 
 
     Respectfully submitted,

October 23, 1992  

Dear Mr. Olsen:  

     This is in response to your petition to reschedule marijuana 
from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.  
The crux of your petition is that marijuana itself need not have 
an accepted medical use in treatment in the United States if it 
is shown that marijuana is the source of an accepted and useful 
medication.  To that end, you argue that marijuana should be 
rescheduled as a source of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol because 
dronabinol, the synthetic form of the same isomer, is controlled 
in Schedule II.  

     In a final rule published on May 13, 1986, then 
Administrator John C. Lawn placed a very specific substance, 
synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft 
gelatin capsules, in Schedule II.  Administrator Lawn's action 
did not involve the rescheduling of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
itself, nor did it include any form of dronabinol other than the 
synthetic.  Accordingly, pursuant to 21 C.F.R.  1308.44(c), your 
petition to reschedule marijuana is not accepted.  

     Since I am not accepting your petition on the grounds that 
dronabinol is a wholly synthetic substance, not obtained from 
marijuana, it is unnecessary for me to consider the broader 
question of whether the rescheduling of marijuana would be 
appropriate if accepted medications were indeed obtained from 
that source.  As you are well aware, the issue of whether 
marijuana itself has any accepted medical use is pending before 
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit.  We are confident that the Court will find no merit in 
the petition and that it will affirm my ruling in that case.  

     Very truly yours,  

     Robert C. Bonner  
     Administrator of Drug Enforcement

July 13, 1993  

Dear Mr. Olsen:  

     This replies to your May 13, 1993, letter asking several 
questions about drugs.  

     It is true that a good many drugs useful in therapeutics can 
be extracted from herbs.  Some drugs have an animal origin, e.g., 
many hormones.  A synthetic drug is a drug that is made by 
chemically combining various starting materials to make the 
desired product.  The product is then identical in all respects 
to the product isolated from a plant source.  Such a product can 
be marketed under the same name.  For example, cortisone is 
synthesized from a yam that grows in Mexico and it is identical 
to cortisone extracted from adrenal tissue.  

     A synthetic drug would be in the same schedule as its 
naturally occurring twin.  For example, synthetic lysergic acid 
amide is in the same schedule as lysergic acid amide derived from 
the plant source.  

     Please let me know if I can be of further assistance on drug 
matters.  

     Sincerely yours,

______________________________________)


                           MOTION FOR REMAND  


     The Drug Enforcement Administration, respondent in the above-

captioned appeal, hereby moves this Court to remand the action to the 

Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.  In support of 

this motion and as the basis therefore, respondent states as follows:  

     1.   On September 6, 1992, appellant Olsen filed a petition with 

the Administrator requesting that marijuana be rescheduled from 

Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.  In 

support of this petition, appellant filed a statement of grounds for 

rescheduling in compliance with 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.44(b)(B).  

     2.   On October 23, 1992, the Administrator responded to 

appellant's petition by refusing to accept that petition for filing. 

Prior to rejecting the petition for filing the Administrator took no 

action to review the grounds upon which appellant relied in that 

petition.  

     3.   Pursuant to the 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.44(c), respondent is 

required to accept the petition for filing absent some defect in 

format.  As this requirement was not met, respondent now requests this 

Court to remand the matter so that respondent may accept appellant's 

petition for filing and review that petition in accordance with 

regulations.  See NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  

     4.   Respondent makes this motion in the interests of fairness 

and judicial economy and not with the intent of causing unnecessary 

delay.  Therefore, respondent respectfully requests this Court to 

order the Administrator upon remand to accept appellant's petition for 

filing and to make a ruling upon the matter within 90 days of the date 

of this Court's final order in the related cases of Alliance for 

Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-1168 

and Drug Policy Foundation v. Drug Enforcement Administration, No. 92-

1179.  Both of these cases are scheduled for oral argument on October 

1, 1993.

     1.   On September 6, 1992, I filed a petition with the Administrator 

requesting that marijuana be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II 

of the Controlled Substances Act.  In support of this petition, I filed a 

statement of grounds for rescheduling in compliance with 21 C.F.R. &#167; 

1308.44(b)(B).  

     2.   On October 23, 1992, the Administrator responded by refusing to 

accept my petition for filing and by ruling on its merits.  Contrary to 

what the respondent says in paragraph two of the Motion for Remand, the 

Administrator did review the grounds upon which I relied and did make a 

ruling on the merits of my petition.

     3.   Pursuant to the 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.44(c), respondent is required 

to accept a petition for filing absent some defect in format.  As the 

respondent now admits, this requirement was not met, and respondent now 

claims it is requesting this Court to remand the matter so that it may 

accept my petition for filing in accordance with regulations.  However, 

since the respondent ruled on the merits of my petition, it is 

questionable whether the respondent actually refused to accept my petition 

for filing.  

     4.   Respondent claims to make the Motion for Remand in the interests 

of fairness and judicial economy and not with the intent of causing 

unnecessary delay.  However, the respondent fails to mention that the Drug 

Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been developing a pattern of 

unfairness, waste of judicial resources and unnecessary delay.  The 

respondent mentions one example in the Motion for Remand, NORML v. 

Ingersoll, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974), but fails to mention another 

case where a petition was not accepted for filing, Carl Eric Olsen v. 

Drug Enforcement Administration, 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir 1989).  Between 

1983 and 1985, I filed several petitions which the DEA refused to accept, 

until a mandamus action was filed in the U.S. District Court.  Id. 878 

F.2d at 1459.  Then, after review of the DEA's denial of the petition on 

its merits was sought, the DEA asked this Court &quot;to remand the matter for 

renewed agency consideration.&quot;  Id. 878 F.2d at 1460.  This is exactly 

what the DEA is doing now.  

     5.   Since the DEA has already ruled on the merits of my petition, 

the only possible reason for a remand would be because the DEA didn't make 

a reasonable decision on the merits of my petition and now wants to hold 

an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge to correct 

its error.  If the DEA simply plans to deny the petition again after it is 

accepted for filing, then there is no reason for a remand, because a final 

ruling has already been made and such a remand would simply be a waste of 

judicial resources and an unnecessary delay.  

     6.   Respondent now requests this Court to order the Administrator 

upon remand to accept my petition for filing and to make a ruling upon the 

matter within 90 days of the date of this Court's final order in the 

related cases of Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement 

Administration, No. 92-1168 and Drug Policy Foundation v. Drug Enforcement 

Administration, No. 92-1179.  Both of these cases are scheduled for oral 

argument on October 1, 1993.  I strongly oppose my case being delayed for 

these two cases.  The grounds upon which I seek rescheduling are entirely 

unrelated to the grounds relied upon in these two cases, and, if this 

Court decides to remand this matter, I think this Court should set a time 

frame that is unrelated to them.  

     Respectfully submitted,  

     Carl E. Olsen, pro se

Dear Senator Harkin:  

     This is in response to your letter of October 12, 1993, on 
behalf of your constituent, Mr. Carl E. Olsen.  

     Pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  811, and interested party can 
petition the DEA to reschedule a controlled substance.  When such 
a petition is filed with the Drug Enforcement Administration, it 
is carefully evaluated to determine whether the petition meets 
the requirements of 21 C.F.R.  1308.44.  Section (b) of that 
regulation requires that the petition conform to the format 
provided and also specifies that four copies be filed.  If the 
petition is accepted for filing, the Administrator will evaluate 
the petition on its merits.  If the petition is not accepted for 
filing, because it is either lacking in the regulatory 
requirements or not readily understood, the Administrator will 
notify the petitioner of his decision and reasons thereof.  21 
C.F.R.  1308.44(c).  A copy of the regulation has been provided 
for your convenience.  

     As you are aware, your constituent has appealed the DEA's 
nonacceptance of his petition to the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia.  In that case, the DEA has 
asked for a remand of the action in order that the Administrator 
may accept Mr. Olsen's petition for filing and review that 
petition on its merits.  The DEA is constrained from commenting 
further on the merits of Mr. Olsen's case since it is currently 
pending before the court of appeals.  

     I hope the foregoing will assist you in responding to your 
constituent.  

     Sincerely,  

     Stephen H. Greene  
     Acting Administrator of Drug Enforcement

Dear Senator Grassley:  

     This is in response to your letter of October 25, 1993, on 
behalf of your constituent, Mr. Carl E. Olsen.  

     As you are aware, your constituent has appealed the Drug 
Enforcement Administration's (DEA) nonacceptance of his petition 
to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 
Controlled Substances Act to the United States Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia.  Pursuant to 21 U.S.C.  811, and 
interested party can petition the DEA to reschedule a controlled 
substance.  When such a petition is filed with the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, it is carefully evaluated to 
determine whether the petition meets the requirements of 21 
C.F.R.  1308.44.  Section (b) of that regulation requires that 
the petition conform to the format provided and be readily 
understood.  If the petition is accepted for filing, the 
Administrator will evaluate the petition on its merits.  If the 
petition is not accepted for filing, the Administrator will 
notify the petitioner of his decision and reasons thereof.  21 
C.F.R.  1308.44(c).  A copy of the regulation has been provided 
for your convenience.  

     Despite Mr. Olsen's contentions, the Administrator did not 
review the grounds upon which Mr. Olsen relied in his petition 
before refusing to accept his petition.  However, DEA has 
recognized that the requirement that a petition be accepted for 
filing absent some ambiguity or some defect in format was not met 
in this matter.  Therefore, in the pending case before the Court 
of Appeals, DEA has asked for a remand of the action in order 
that the Administrator may accept Mr. Olsen's petition for filing 
and review that petition on its merits.  The DEA is constrained 
from commenting further on the merits of Mr. Olsen's case since 
it is currently pending before the court of appeals.  

     I hope the foregoing will assist you in responding to your 
constituent.  

     Sincerely,

December 2, 1993  

Dear Mr. Olsen:  

     This replies to your July 21, 1993, letter concerning 
synthetic dronabinol (delta-9-THC).  

     In respect to the naturally extracted and synthetically 
manufactured dronabinol, the Drug Enforcement Agency has 
promulgated the enclosed regulation.  Please note that 
tetrahydrocannabinol is a Schedule I substance, but dronabinol, 
synthetic, in sesame oil and in a soft gelatin capsule, is a U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration approved drug product and is a 
Schedule II substance.  Both marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol 
are Schedule I substances.  

     With respect to your other questions on marijuana, the 
original chemical researcher was Dr. Roger Adams of the 
University of Illinois chemistry department.  The pharmacology of 
the compounds was investigated by Dr. Seigried Lowe of the 
University of Utah.  A review of marijuana is given on page 549-
553 of Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of 
Therapeutics, 8th Edition, Pergamon Press, 1990.

                               FINAL ORDER


     This order is issued pursuant to an Order dated December 9, 1993, 

from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 

Circuit which remanded the matter of a petition from Carl Eric Olsen to 

the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for a ruling by the agency.

     On September 6, 1992, Carl Eric Olsen (Petitioner) of Des Moines, 

Iowa, submitted a petition requesting that the controlled substance 

marijuana, be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 

Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA).  The Petitioner's grounds 

were based on his evaluation of two prior rescheduling actions by the 

Administrator.  See Rescheduling of Synthetic Dronabinol in Sesame Oil 

and Encapsulated in Soft Gelatin Capsules, 51 Fed. Reg. 17476 (1986) and 

Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, 57 Fed. Reg. 10499 (1992).  On October 

23, 1992, the-Administrator of Drug Enforcement, Robert C. Bonner, 

declined to accept his petition.  The Petitioner subsequently filed for 

review of then-Administrator Bonner's decision with the United States 

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
Circuit.  The matter was remanded by Order of that Court to the DEA for a 

ruling.  Pursuant to that Court's Order, and 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.44(c), the 

Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration has 

considered the matters before him and thereby renders his final decision.

     In his Petition for rescheduling, the Petitioner alleged that 

marijuana need not have an accepted medical use in treatment in the 

United States in order to be rescheduled from Schedule I, but &quot;it only 

needs to be shown that marijuana is a source for an accepted and useful 

medication&quot;.  This contention was based on Petitioner's own analogies 

drawn from an earlier DEA marijuana rescheduling case, 57 Fed. Reg. 10499 

(1992), and subsequent written statements made to the Petitioner by then-

Administrator Bonner regarding coca leaves and opium plant material; and 

the Petitioner's incorrect contention that the DEA proposed to reschedule 

dronabinol in a proposed rulemaking.  See Rescheduling of Synthetic 

Dronabinol in Sesame Oil and Encapsulated in Soft Gelatin Capsules, 50 

Fed. Reg. 42186 (1985).  It appears that Petitioner contends that this 

rescheduling action included delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), 

an ingredient in marijuana, and concluded that &quot;since marijuana is now a 

source for an accepted and useful medication, it must now be rescheduled 

from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA&quot;.

     The Deputy Administrator finds, for the reasons stated herein, that 

the grounds upon which the Petitioner relies are not 


                                     2
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
sufficient to justify the initiation of proceedings for the transfer of 

marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA. 

     In July 1992, the Petitioner wrote then-Administrator Bonner 

regarding his final order of March 26, 1992, (57 Fed. Reg. 10499), in 

which the Administrator declined to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II, 

and the apparent &quot;unfair&quot; classification of the marijuana plant as a 

Schedule I substance, while coca and opium plants remained in Schedule 

II.  Then-Administrator Bonner replied by letter on August 17, 1992, and 

distinguished the pharmaceuticals or derivative compounds from each 

plant.  Apparently, the Petitioner then created a theory, that given 

that the Schedule II opium and coca plants were a source for accepted 

medication, then if marijuana plants were a source for accepted 

medications it should also be a Schedule II substance.  To further his 

argument, the Petitioner pointed to the rescheduled drug, which he 

called dronabinol, as having its source in marijuana.  The Petitioner 

also alluded to inconsistencies of scheduling of delta-9-THC, a 

component of marijuana, between the CSA and certain multilateral 

international agreements.

     When the CSA was created, Congress specified the initial scheduling 

of controlled substances and the criteria by which controlled substances 

could be rescheduled.  21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 811-812.  The DEA is bound, by law, 

to follow this mandate.  Congress placed both the tetrahydrocannabinols, 

which includes delta-9-THC, and the plant marijuana into Schedule I when 

it enacted the


                                    3
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
CSA.  See Pub. L. 91-513, &#167; 202(c), Schedule I (c)(17) and (c)(10). 

Similarly, Congress placed opium poppy and straw and coca leaves into 

Schedule II.  See Pub. L. 91-513, &#167; 202(c), Schedule II (a)(3) and 

 (a)(4).  The legislative history indicates that marijuana was placed 

into Schedule I on its own merits and not because delta-9-THC could be 

extracted from it.  H.R. Rep. No. 1444, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, at 

12 (1970).

     Whether or not marijuana is a source of delta-9-THC is irrelevant to 

the status of marijuana under the CSA.  With regard to the classification 

of controlled substances, the Attorney General may, by rule, add to the 

established schedules or transfer between such schedules and drug or 

other substance if [s]he finds that such drug or other substance has a 

potential for abuse, and makes with respect to such drug or other 

substance the findings prescribed by subsection (b) of Section 812 for 

the schedule in which such drug is to be placed.  21 U.S.C. &#167; 811(a)(1). 

The Attorney General has delegated this authority to the Administrator, 

who has redelegated it to the Deputy Administrator.  See 28 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 

0.100(b) and 0.104.  (59 Fed. Reg. 23637 (May 6, 1994)).

     In order for a substance to be placed into Schedule II, the 

Attorney General must find that:  &quot;(A) The drug or other substance has a 

high potential for abuse.  (B) The drug or other substance has a 

currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a 

currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.  (C) Abuse of 

the drug or other substance may lead


                                    4
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
 to severe psychological or physical dependence.&quot;  21 U.S.C. &#167; 812(b)(2).

     Then-Administrator John C. Lawn previously determined that marijuana 

does not have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United 

States and as a result must remain in Schedule I.  See Marijuana 

Rescheduling Petition, 54 Fed. Reg. 53767 (1989).  Then-Administrator 

Lawn's final order was appealed to the United States Circuit Court of 

Appeals for the D.C. Circuit which returned the matter to the DEA for an 

explanation of the factors relied upon in determining &quot;currently accepted 

medical use&quot;.  See Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA, 930 F.2d 

936 (D.C. Cir. 1991).

     In response to the remand, then-Administrator Bonner issued a final 

order in which he determined that for a substance to have a &quot;currently 

accepted medical use&quot; the following must exist: 

     a.   the drug's chemistry must be known and reproducible; 

     b.   there must be adequate safety studies; 

     c.   there must be adequate and well-controlled studies proving 

          efficacy; 

     d.   the drug must be accepted by qualified experts; and

     e.   the scientific evidence must be widely available. 

Then-Administrator Bonner concluded that marijuana failed to meet all 

elements of the five-part test and, therefore, did not meet the 

statutorily prescribed criteria for a Schedule II substance. 

Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, 57 Fed. Reg. 10499 (1992); See 


                                  5
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. DEA, et al., 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. 

Cir. 1994) upholding the Administrator's decision. 

     Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator concludes that the 

Petitioner's contention that marijuana need not have an accepted 

medical use in treatment in the United States in order to be 

rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA is not in 

accordance with law.  DEA may only move a drug from Schedule I if 

there is a finding of &quot;currently accepted medical use in treatment in 

the United States&quot;.

     Although delta-9-THC is the principle psychoactive ingredient in 

marijuana, it can be synthesized and exist as a chemical. Delta-9-THC 

is a generic term which refers to four separate chemicals and two 

mixtures of chemicals, i.e., four stereochemical variants of the 

parent substance and two racemates.  One of the stereochemical 

variants, the (-) delta-9-trans-THC isomer, is the principle 

psychoactive ingredient in Cannabis sativa, L., or marijuana.  That 

isomer is also the ingredient in a pharmaceutical product which has 

been shown to be safe and effective as an anti-emetic for certain 

patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, and is identified chemically 

as (6aR-trans)-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-

dibenzo[b,d]-pyran-1-ol.  The International Nonproprietary name (INN) 

and the U.S. Adopted Name (USAN) for that isomer of delta-9-THC is 

dronabinol. 

     With the development of scientific and medical evidence that 

demonstrated that a pharmaceutical product which contained


                                  6
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
dronabinol was safe and effective for the treatment of nausea and 

vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in certain patients, 

then-Administrator John C. Lawn rescheduled this pharmaceutical 

product from Schedule I to Schedule II. See 51 Fed. Reg. 17476 

 (1986).  Only the pharmaceutical product was transferred from 

Schedule I to Schedule II, i.e., &quot;dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame 

oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules in a U.S. Food and Drug 

Administration approved drug product&quot;.  No rescheduling action was 

taken with regard to (-) delta-9-trans-THC, i.e., dronabinol, which 

remains in Schedule I of the CSA. Tetrahydrocannabinols, including 

delta-9-THC, one of the synthetic equivalents of the substances 

contained in the plant or resinous extractives of Cannabis 

(marijuana) are listed at 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1308.11(d)(25). 

     Tetrahydrocannabinols and all their isomers, including delta-9-

THC, are also the subject of control by international agreement under 

the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, 

February 21, 1971, 32 U.S.T. 543, T.I.A.S. 9725, 1019 U.N.T.S. 175. 

Cannabis, cannabis resin and extracts and tinctures of cannabis are 

regulated as Schedule I substances under the United Nations Single 

Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, March 30, 1961, 18 U.S.T. 1407, 

T.I.A.S. 6298, 520 U.N.T.S. 204. The United States is a party to both 

conventions.

     Then-Administrator Lawn also discussed the United States 

international obligations in his Dronabinol in Sesame Oil and 

Encapsulated in a Soft Gelatin Capsule, rescheduling action. 


                                  7
</PRE>
<HR>

<PRE>
See 51 Fed. Reg. 17476 (1986). Since Article 7 of the Convention on 

Psychotropic Substances, 1971 has strict prohibitions on activities 

involving Schedule I drugs, in 1987, the United States Government 

initiated an action to have delta-9-THC transferred to Schedule II to 

allow the pharmaceutical product to be marketed. See U.N. Doc. 

E/CN.7/1990/4.  Such a transfer was not inconsistent with the 

substance delta-9-THC remaining in the CSA Schedule I. Under Article 

23 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971, a party may 

adopt more strict or severe measures of control if desirable or 

necessary for the protection of the public health and welfare. 

     Under the CSA, the regulation of chemicals and the plant 

material are distinct from each other. The classification of delta-9-

THC has no bearing on the classification of marijuana. Under the CSA, 

a proposed change in the schedule of either a tetrahydrocannabinol or 

the plant marijuana requires the Attorney General to proceed 

independently. 

     Petitioner apparently does not wish to look to the clear 

construct of the Controlled Substances Act, but to pose alternative 

theories of the Act.  Under the CSA, drugs or other substances may be 

treated and classified differently, according to the enumerated 

statutory criteria. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 812(b). 

     The Deputy Administrator reaffirms that marijuana does not have 

a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States 

and is thus appropriately listed as a Schedule I controlled

support the petitioner's contention that since marijuana, coca, and 

opium are all plant materials they must be treated alike in the CSA. 

The Deputy Administrator further finds that the rescheduling of the 

pharmaceutical product &quot;dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame oil and 

encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule in a U.S. Food and Drug 

Administration approved drug product&quot;, which contains the synthetic 

chemical ingredient (-) delta-9-trans-THC, did not require that 

either the plant marijuana or substance delta-9-THC be similarly 

rescheduled. The Petitioner's request is denied.

                UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
                 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
________________________________________________________________

CARL ERIC OLSEN,

          Petitioner,                    No. 94-1605

     -vs-

DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION,         PETITIONER'S STATEMENT
                                         OF THE ISSUES
          Respondent.
________________________________________________________________

     The Petitioner raises the following issues to be decided by

the Court:

     1.   Whether the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 

Administrator erred in ruling that the DEA may only move 

marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) 

if there is a finding of "currently accepted medical use in 

treatment in the United States."

     2.   Whether this court's ruling in Alliance for Cannabis 

Therapeutics v. DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (upholding the 

DEA's decision not to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule 

II of the CSA, based on the lack of marijuana's "currently 

accepted medical use in treatment in the United States"), 

effectively overruled this court's prior ruling in National 

Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. DEA, 559 F.2d 

735 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (finding that marijuana could be moved to 

Schedule II without having a "currently accepted medical use in 

treatment in the United States").

     3.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling 

that the principal psychoactive ingredient in Cannabis sativa, L. 

(marijuana), the (-) delta-9-trans-THC isomer of delta-9-THC 

(dronabinol), 21 C.F.R.  1308.12(f)(1), remains in Schedule I, 

while the identical substance becomes a Schedule II substance 

when it is contained in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 

approved drug product (Marinol) "in sesame oil and encapsulated 

in a soft gelatin capsule."

     4.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling 

that the regulation of chemicals and their plant material sources 

are distinct from, and have no relationship to, each other.

     5.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling 

that the placement of marijuana in the CSA has no relationship to 

the scheduling of delta-9-THC, contrary to this court's ruling in 

United States v. Watson, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  

     6.   Whether the Administrator of the DEA erred in ruling 

that plant materials are not treated consistently in the CSA.

     Respectfully submitted,

Hi:

I think these are the two files that you wanted.  It is awful 
to lose stuff from the hard disk, when there is no one else to 
blame.

Hello Carl:

Thanks for the letter.  Let me see if I can answer your questions 
without waiving my hands around.

(1)  How many isomers are there of the THC molecule?

There is delta-1 THC (using a different numbering system, this is 
also known as delta-9 THC).  It has two asymmetric centers, and 
so it can exist in a trans- or as a cis-form (known as 
stereoisomers) and each of these forms is resolvable into a 
dextro- and a levo-component (known as optical isomers).  Putting 
this into a box form, you have:


                    trans-pair (stereo)         cis-pair (stereo)


     dextro-           d-(trans)-delta-1          d-(cis)-delta-1
     (optical)              THC **                     THC


     levo-             l-(trans)-delta-1          l-(cis)-delta-1
     (optical)              THC *                      THC


which adds up to four isomers.

There is also delta-6 THC (same as delta-1(6) THC or, with a 
different numbering systems delta-8 THC).  Using the same square 
as with the delta-1 isomer, we have:


                    trans-pair (stereo)         cis-pair (stereo)


     dextro-           d-(trans)-delta-6          d-(cis)-delta-6
     (optical)              THC                        THC


     levo-             l-(trans)-delta-6          l-(cis)-delta-6
     (optical)              THC                        THC



which totals another four isomers.

There is a third isomer explicitly named in the law, not a 
natural material, but a laboratory product that had been studied 
in the early days of the chemistry of these compounds.  This is 
called delta-3,4 THC (or delta-6a,10a THC with the other 
numbering system).  Here the two optically active carbon atoms 
that allowed the cis-trans argument now carry the double bond 
(the meaning of the term delta) but a new optically active site 
has been opened up at the 1- (9-) position.  So there can be a 
dextro-form and a levo-form (optical isomers) but no cis- or 
trans-pairs.  This totals to another two isomers.  Thus the 
answer to your first question, there are ten possible isomers of 
THC to be considered in the halls of law enforcement.

(2)  What is an isomer?

That depends upon who you ask, and in what context.  Literally, 
iso- means the "same", and -mer is from meros, meaning "part."  
In common chemical usage, it is generally taken to mean that the 
same atoms are there (in terms of which elements and how many of 
them), but they are just hooked up differently.  And when there 
are describing (or limiting) prefixes, they emphasize just how 
these different hookups are most readily recognized.  
     
Stereoisomers are distinguished by the differences in shape.  
Think of a hand in a five-fingered rubber glove, making all kinds 
of different forms, but always with the same amount of hand 
inside the glove.  A fist shape and a splayed finger shape would 
be stereoisomers.

Optical isomers are distinguished by their mirror-image 
relationships.  Two molecules not superimposable but are in every 
other way identical.  Put a rubber glove on your right hand, and 
another on your left.  They are identical, except that cannot be 
superimposed.  One is the mirror reflection of the other.

Positional isomers are defined as have certain groups as being 
over there rather than over here.  Consider a conventional rubber 
glove (the thumb-shaped covering at position one) and then 
another with the thumb position where the third finger usually 
is, and the third finger position at the thumb's location.  These 
are positional isomers, with the finger positions being the 
rearranged factor.

The authors of the law, and thus the DEA, are quite inconsistent 
in the use of this term.  Since you have the Controlled 
Substances Manual, check out the first full paragraph on page 226 
for some insight into this confusion (page 212 if you have the 
first edition).

(3)  Is delta-9 THC an isomer, or does it have isomers of its 
own?


Look up at the first box.  All for named items are isomers of 
delta-9 THC (the trans- and cis-pairs, and the optical isomers of 
each pair).  Thus delta-9 THC can exist in any of four isomeric 
forms.  This is pretty close to saying that delta-9 THC has its 
own isomers.

But, in common parlance, the term delta-9 THC is very often used 
for the natural component of cannabis, the active component, and 
this is explicitly the trans, levo-isomer of delta-9 THC.  This 
is the lower left isomer in that box, the one marked with a "*".  
If this is the sense in which the term delta-9 THC is used (and 
it is so used frequently and casually) then it is an isomer, the 
natural isomer, the one with the * above.

The answer to this question depends exactly on what the asker has 
in mind when he uses the term delta-9 (or, delta-1) THC.  
Remember, that the two names are synonymous.

One final caveat.  The delta-9 THC that is the material used in 
the Schedule II drug known as Dronabinol is something yet 
different than any of these.  It is a synthetic material, and is 
isolated as the trans- material, but I do not believe that it is 
resolved into its optical isomers.  Thus, in this context, delta-
9 THC is a 50:50 mixture of l-(trans)-delta-9 THC and d-(trans)-
delta-9 THC.  This is a 50:50 mixture of the one * and the two ** 
things in the first box above. 

To summarize:

When the term delta-1 (delta-9) THC is used to represent the 
active factor of cannabis, it is the isomer with the one *.

When the term delta-1 (delta-9) THC is used to represent the 
active component in the Schedule II drug, it is a 50:50 mixture 
of the one * and two ** isomers.  

When the term delta-1 (delta-9) THC is used to represent the 
chemical concept without stereo- or optical-designations, then 
the term embraces all four isomers in that first box.  

Hope this helps.  It is a one hour lecture distilled down into a 
ten minute note.

Hi Carl:

I have just now been looking with more care at the package insert
that accompanies the commercial Marinol, Dronabinol, and also the

PDR, and both of them give the chemical name as:

(6a-R-trans)-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6,6,9-trimethyl-3-pentyl-6H-
dibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-ol

and the Merck index refers to these commercial drugs as

(-)-delta1-3,4-trans-form

I had assumed, without checking, that the synthetic material was 
the racemate (the two trans isomers in the first of the diagrams 
I sent you.  But the letter "R" in the first name, and the minus
sign "-" in the second name, both attest to the fact that the
synthetic drug (the component of the schedule II item) is indeed
a single isomer.  Thus the term delta-1 THC (delta-9 THC) means 
not three things, but only two.  As a general term, it can be all 
four of those isomers, individually or collectively.  As a 
botanical term, it is the one specific isomer in that collection, 
the l-trans delta-1 isomer (the first "l" is the letter ell, as 
the first letter of levo, or rotating to the left and the second 
is the number "1").  And so is the synthetic.  

And, as to your other question, no, the two isomers cannot be 
isolated from the plant, as only one is there.  

To summarize:

     l-trans- (the letter ell)
     levo-trans
     6a-R-trans
     
all refer to the natural (as well as the synthetic) delta-1 THC, 
that is apparently prepared from optically active starting
materials.

     dl-trans
     racemic trans
     6a without the R but with the trans

all refer to an optically inactive form of delta-1 THC, still
trans, but containing an isomer that is not found in nature, and
that is not in the drug Marinol.

     delta-1 THC can refer to any or all of the four isomers, 
both trans and cis, both levo and dextro.

Sorry about the wrong assumption above.  Hope this makes 
everything clearer.

                     <B>STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE</B>

     Whether the Drug Enforcement Administration properly

rejected the petitioner's theory that marihuana plants should be

moved from Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances

Act because marihuana plants are a source of an accepted and

useful medication when the petitioner's theory was based solely

upon language in an informal letter and was contradicted directly

by the plain language of the Controlled Substances Act.

     Except for those already included in the Addendum to the

Petitioner's Brief, the pertinent statutes and regulations are

<HR>
                       STATEMENT OF THE CASE

I.   STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND

     In response to the growing drug problem in the United

States, Congress in 1970 passed the Controlled Substances Act, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/801.html">21

U.S.C. 801 <i>et seq.</i></a> ("CSA").  The CSA classifies various hazardous

drugs into five schedules.  <i>Id</i>. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/812.html">812</a>.  Restrictions upon use and

access to a particular drug vary based upon the drug's schedule

status in the CSA.  Drugs in Schedule I are subject to more

severe restrictions than drugs in the other schedules.  See

<i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i> v. <i>Drug Enforcement Admin.</i>,

930 F.2d 936, 937 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  Congress placed marihuana in

Schedule I of the CSA.<A HREF="#1">1</A>  21 U.S.C. 812(c), Schedule I(c)(10).

     Although Congress made the initial scheduling decisions, the

CSA specifically permits the Attorney General to add a substance

to a schedule, transfer a substance from one schedule to another

or remove a substance from the schedules entirely.  <i>Id</i>. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/811.html">811</a>(a).

The Attorney General may only transfer a substance to a different

schedule if she "finds that such drug or other substance has a

potential for abuse" and makes findings that the drug or

substance meets the requirements for the new schedule.  <i>Id</i>.  The

findings required for placing a substance in a particular

schedule are listed in 21 U.S.C. 812(b).  The Attorney General

has delegated the authority to reschedule controlled substances

____________________

     <A NAME="1">1</A>    The substance is called "marihuana" in the CSA and the
respondent will use that spelling throughout this brief.
However, where the spelling "marijuana" is used in a quoted
passage, the spelling has not been changed.

                                2
<HR>
to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration

("DEA").  28 C.F.R. 0.100(b).  The Drug Enforcement Administrator

("Administrator") has further delegated this authority to the

Deputy Administrator.  28 C.F.R. 0.104.

     For over 20 years, various groups and individuals have asked

DEA to exercise its authority to move marihuana from Schedule I

to a less restrictive schedule or to remove marihuana from the

CSA schedules entirely.  See <i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>

v. <i>Drug Enforcement Admin.</i>, 15 F.3d 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994);

<i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>, 930 F.2d at 937; <i>National

Org. for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</i> v. <i>Drug Enforcement Admin.</i>,

559 F.2d 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <i>National Org. for the Reform of

Marijuana Laws</i> v. <i>Ingersoll</i>, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

Despite these efforts, in March of 1992, the Administrator issued

a final order denying a petition to reschedule marihuana from

Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.  See 57 Fed. Reg. 10,499

(1992).<A HREF="#2">2</A>

     The Administrator relied upon the language of the CSA in

____________________

     <A NAME="2">2</A>    DEA's review of the rescheduling petition was quite
extensive.  DEA issued a notice of a hearing on the rescheduling
petition in 1986.  See 51 Fed. Reg. 22,946 (1986).  After
hearings before an administrative law judge, the Administrator
issued findings of fact and conclusions of law that determined
that marihuana should not be moved from Schedule I because the
marihuana plant has no currently accepted medical use and because
it is not safe for use, even under medical supervision.  See 54
Fed. Reg. 53,767, 53,784 (1989).  On appeal, this court generally
upheld the Administrator's decision but remanded the matter for
clarification.  See <i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>, 930 F.2d
at 940-941.  On remand, the Administrator again found that
marihuana plants should remain in Schedule I.  See 57 Fed. Reg.
at 10,507-10,508.  The latter decision was affirmed by this Court
in <i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics</i>, 15 F.3d at 1137.

                                3
<HR>
making his determination.  Under the CSA, a drug or substance may

not be placed in Schedule II absent findings that:

     (A)  The drug or other substance has a high
          potential for abuse.

     (B)  The drug or other substance has a currently
          accepted medical use in treatment in the
          United States or a currently accepted medical
          use with severe restrictions.

     (C)  Abuse of the drug or other substances may
          lead to severe psychological or physical
          dependence.

21 U.S.C. 812(b)(2)(A)-(C).

     In the Administrator's final order, he concluded that the

marihuana plant had no currently accepted medical use and thus

could not be placed in schedule II.  57 Fed. Reg. at 10,499.

The Administrator applied a five-part test for determining

whether a substance had a currently accepted medical use:

     (1)  the drug's chemistry must be known and reproducible;

     (2)  there must be adequate safety studies;

     (3)  there must be adequate and well-controlled
          studies proving efficacy;

     (4)  the drug must be accepted by qualified experts; and

     (5)  the scientific evidence must be widely available.

57 Fed. Reg. at 10,504-10,507.  After reviewing the evidence in

the record, the Administrator found that marihuana could not

satisfy a single one of these criteria.  <i>Id</i>. at 10,507.  These

findings, as well as other findings of fact and conclusions of

law, resulted in the denial of the marihuana rescheduling

petition.

                                4
<HR>
<B>II.  THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS</B>

     On July 21, 1992, the petitioner sent a letter to then-

Administrator Robert C. Bonner in which he raised several 

questions about the Administrator's final order.  In the letter, 

the petitioner appeared to agree with the Administrator's finding

that marihuana, as a plant, failed to satisfy the first part of

the test for determining a currently accepted medical use because

a plant such as marihuana is not a scientifically established

compound capable of reproduction in standard dosages.  A. 1.<A HREF="#3">3</A>

The petitioner's letter then asked why coca and opium plants (the

sources of cocaine, morphine, and heroin) were placed in Schedule

II.  <I>Id</I>.  If, the petitioner reasoned, coca and opium plants are

subject to the same scientific variances as marihuana plants,

then DEA is "treating marijuana unfairly."  <I>Id</I>.  The petitioner

suggested either removing all plants from the CSA schedules

because they "will never fit into your definition of drugs" or

changing the definition to account for the inconsistency in the

treatment of the different plants.  <I>Id</I>.

     On August 17, 1992, Administrator Bonner sent the petitioner

a response to his letter.  A. 5.  In the response, the

Administrator rejected the petitioner's attempt to analogize

marihuana plants to coca and opium plants.  <I>Id</I>.  The

Administrator explained that when Congress placed coca leaves and

opium plant materials in Schedule II, it was aware that these

____________________

     <A NAME="3">3</A>    "A." references are to the bound appendix submitted by
the petitioner with his brief.

                                5
<HR>
plants had been recognized historically as the source for a

variety of accepted and useful medications.  <I>Id</I>.  The plants

contain medically active alkaloids that can be extracted and used

to produce pharmaceutical compounds capable of reproduction in

standardized doses.  <I>Id</I>.  In contrast, the Administrator pointed

out that the recent attempts to reschedule marihuana were not

grounded on claims that medically useful compounds could be

extracted from marihuana, but rather that smoking marihuana

itself produced medical benefits.  <I>Id</I>.  Thus, the Administrator

found the scheduling decisions to be reconcilable.  <I>Id</I>. at 5-6.

     The petitioner, proceeding t)ro se, then filed a formal

request for the rescheduling of marihuana pursuant to 21 U.S.C.

811 and 21 C.F.R. 1307.03.<A HREF="#4">4</A>  A. 2-4.  In his petition, he drew

an analogy from language in the Administrator's letter of August

17, 1992.  He reasoned that if coca leaves and opium plants could

be placed in Schedule II because they are sources of accepted and

____________________

     <A NAME="4">4</A>    The petitioner has frequently litigated issues related
to the legal treatment of marihana.  He challenged several
criminal convictions by arguing that marihuana smoking was
protected by the free exercise clause of the First Amendment and
the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See
<I>Olsen</I> v. <I>Iowa</I>, 808 F.2d 652, 653 (8th Cir. 1986); <I>United States</I>
v. <I>Rush</I>, 738 F.2d 497, 511-513 (lst Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470
U.S. 1004 (1985); <I>State</I> v. <I>Olsen</I>, 315 N.W.2d 1, 7-9 (Iowa 1982).
Additionally, the petitioner has brought numerous civil actions
seeking to obtain judicial authorization to use marihuana.  See
<I>Olsen</I> v. <I>Drug Enforcement Admin.</I>, 878 F.2d 1458, 1461-1465 (D.C.
Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 906 (1990); <I>Olsen</I> v. <I>Drug</I>
<I>Enforcement Admin.</I>, 776 F.2d 267, 268 (llth Cir. 1985), cert.
denied, 475 U.S. 1030 (1986); <I>Olsen</I> v. <I>State</I>, Civ.  No. 83-301-E,
1986 WL 4045, at *1 (S.D. Iowa March 19, 1986).  The petitioner
also participated in the administrative proceedings where the DEA
considered a petition to reschedule marihuana from Schedule I to
Schedule II of the CSA.  See 54 Fed. Reg. at 53,767.

                                6
<HR>
useful medications, then marihuana plants could be placed in

schedule II if marihuana is shown to be "a source for an accepted

and useful medication."  A. 3.  The petitioner then noted that

dronabinol, a synthetic equivalent of the isomer which is the

principle psychoactive substance in marihuana, has been

rescheduled to Schedule II.  <I>Id</I>.  Because marihuana is the source

of an accepted and useful medication, dronabinol, the petitioner

reasoned that marihuana must be moved to Schedule II of the CSA.

Id. at 4.  The petitioner then requested that the Administrator

reschedule marihuana from Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.

Id. at 2.<A HREF="#5">5</A>

     The Administrator initially refused to accept the

rescheduling petition because dronabinol is a wholly synthetic

substance and is not obtained from marihuana.  A. 7.  However,

after the petitioner appealed, DEA voluntarily asked this court

to remand the petition for a ruling.  This court remanded the

petition in an Order dated December 9, 1993.  See <I>Olsen</I> v. <I>Drug</I>

<I>Enforcement Admin.</I>, No. 93-1109 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 9, 1993).

     On May 16, 1994, Deputy Administrator Stephen H. Greene

issued a nine-page final order denying the petition.  A. 17.  The

final order explained that Congress placed marihuana in Schedule

I.  A. 19-20.  It rejected the petitioner's analogy, finding that

marihuana can only be moved from Schedule I if there is a finding

that marihuana has a "currently accepted medical use in treatment

____________________

      <A NAME="5">5</A>    The petitioner did not ask DEA to reschedule any other
substances.

                                7
<HR>
in the United States."  A. 22.  The order acknowledged that (-)

delta-9-trans-THC isomer, the principal psychoactive ingredient

in marihuana, is also the ingredient in a pharmaceutical product

that has proven to be a safe and effective anti-emetic for

patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.  <I>Id</I>.  However, the order

noted that only a very specific synthetic dronabinol product was

rescheduled to Schedule II -- "dronabinol ("synthetic) in sesame

oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule" in a drug product

approved by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").  A. 23.

The order further stated that the regulation of plants and

chemicals under the CSA is distinct and that the CSA requires the

independent evaluation of each individual controlled substance.

A. 24.  The final order reaffirmed that marihuana plants have no

currently accepted medical use in treatment and found that the

rescheduling of one pharmaceutical product did not require DEA to

transfer marihuana plants or any other substance to Schedule II.

A. 24-25.

     The petitioner has appealed the final order to this court

pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 877.

                     <B>SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT</B>

     Congress placed marihuana in Schedule I of the CSA and this

decision has been consistently approved by the courts.  The

petitioner is incorrect in asserting that marihuana must be moved

from Schedule I to Schedule II if it is a source of an accepted

and useful medication.  The plain language of the CSA requires

that a substance itself must have a currently accepted medical

                                8
<HR>
use before it may be moved from Schedule I to Schedule II.  The

petitioner has failed to provide any evidence to suggest that the

marihuana plant itself has a currently accepted medical use.

Under the CSA, the rescheduling of synthetic dronabinol in a

pharmaceutical product has no effect on the scheduling of the

marihuana plant.  Thus, the petitioner's request for rescheduling

failed to raise any issue that justified the initiation of

rescheduling proceedings.

     The petitioner is also incorrect in asserting that

dronabinol was moved from Schedule I to Schedule II.  Only one

specific pharmaceutical product containing synthetic dronabinol

has been moved to Schedule II: synthetic dronabinol in sesame oil

and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule in a FDA-approved drug

product.  Although the petitioner now seeks to challenge the

legality of the rule rescheduling this pharmaceutical product and

argues that dronabinol should have been rescheduled in its

entirety, he did not raise these issues before DEA.  These

issues should not be considered for the first time by this court.

                            <B>ARGUMENT</B>

<B>I.   STANDARD OF REVIEW</B>

     Any interested person may submit a petition to DEA

requesting that DEA reschedule a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C.

811(a); 21 C.F.R. 1308.44(a).  However, a petition that is

accepted for filing "may be denied by the Administrator within a

reasonable time thereafter if he finds the grounds upon which the

petitioner relies are not sufficient to justify the initiation of

                                9
<HR>
proceedings."  21 C.F.R. 1308.44(c).  The Administrator relied

upon this provision in denying the petition in the instant case.

A. 18-19.

     In reviewing the Administrator's decision, findings of fact,

"if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive."  21

U.S.C. 877.  Additionally, DEA's action may be set aside if it

was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or contrary to

law.  5 U.S.C. 706.  However, when reviewing an administrative

agency's interpretation of a statute, the court must give effect

to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.  Chevron

U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S.

837, 842-843 (1984).  If the statute is silent or ambiguous, the

court is to determine whether the agency's interpretation is

based upon a permissible construction of the statute.  Id. at

843.  The court may not substitute its own judgment for a

reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.

Id. at 844.

<B>II.  CONGRESS, DEA, AND THE COURTS HAVE ALL FOUND THAT
     MARIHUANA IS PROPERLY IN SCHEDULE I OF THE CSA AND MUST
     REMAIN THERE UNTIL IT SATISFIES THE CRITERIA IN 21
     U.S.C. 812(b).</B>

     Congress made the initial decision to place marihuana in

Schedule I.  21 U.S.C. 811(c).  This decision was made after

careful consideration.  The legislative history of the CSA

demonstrates that Congress was sensitive to the arguments of

                                10

_________________________________________________________________


                            <b>ARGUMENT</b>

     The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) claims that the  

issue of whether (-)-delta-9-(trans)-tetrahydrocannabinol (also 

known as levo-trans-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) has been, or 

should have been, rescheduled to Schedule II of the Controlled 

Substances Act is being raised for the first time in this 

petition for judicial review.  This objection is without merit.  

The matter of the scheduling of (-)-delta-9-(trans)-

tetrahydrocannabinol<a href="#1">1</a> was implicit in the original petition for 

rescheduling of marijuana.



____________________
	<a name="1">1</a> Throughout the remainder of this brief, the abreviation 
"THC" will be used in place of the term "tetrahydrocannabinol."


                              - 1 -
<hr>     There are four isomers of delta-9-THC: (1) levo-(trans)-

delta-9-THC; (2) levo-(cis)-delta-9-THC; (3) dextro-(trans)-

delta-9-THC; and (4) dextro-(cis)-delta-9-THC.  Of these four, 

only one is found naturally occurring in the marijuana plant: 

levo-(trans)-delta-9-THC (also known as (-)-delta-9-(trans)-

THC).<a href="#2">2</a>  Levo-(trans)-delta-9-THC is also the only one of the 

four isomers that is active (or psychoactive).  This isomer is 

the same isomer found in the commercial product Marinol.  This 

isomer has also been given the U.S. Adopted Name (USAN) of 

dronabinol.

     In the petitioner's brief which accompanied the original 

petition to the DEA, A. 3-4,<a href="#3">3</a> a substance by the name of 

dronabinol was clearly identified.  A DEA proposal to reschedule 

dronabinol to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act was 

also cited in the orignal brief filed with the DEA by the 

petitioner.  50 Fed. Reg. 42,186 (Oct. 18, 1985).  According to 

the DEA and the Physician's Desk Reference, this substance is 

clearly identified as "the principle psychoactive substance in 

Cannabis sativa L., marijuana."  1989 Physician's Desk Reference, 

page 1859.  In other words, dronabinol can be made synthetically 

or extracted from marijuana, the plant in which it occurs 

naturally.  Dronabinol is exactly the same no matter whether it 

is produced synthetically in a test tube, or extracted from a 

marijuana plant.  This is an important distinction, because 
____________________
     <a name="2">2</a>    Another name for this isomer is levo-(trans)-delta-1-
THC, or (-)-delta-1-(trans)-THC.
     <a name="3">3</a>    "A." references are to the bound appendix submitted by 
the petitioner with his brief.


                              - 2 -
<hr>dronabinol is not exclusively a semi-synthetic substance like 

heroin,<a href="#4">4</a> or a synthetic substance like alphacetylmethadol.<a href="#5">5</a> 

     Of course, the actual substance which was later rescheduled 

was not dronabinol, but rather "dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame 

oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule."  51 Fed. Reg. 

17,476 (1986).  However, this combination of drug and food 

substances was not mentioned in the petitioner's brief which was 

attached to the original petition filed with the DEA.  The reason 

this combination was not mentioned was because sesame oil and 

soft gelatin capsules are foods.  Sesame oil is not added for 

purpose of diluting dronabinol, nor does encapsulation in gelatin 

capsules change the strength or potency of dronabinol.

     The original brief filed with the DEA also referred to an 

international treaty, the <i>Convention on Psychotropic Substances</i>, 

February 21, 1971, 32 U.S.T. 543, T.I.A.S. 9725, 1019 U.N.T.S. 

175, which was amended at the request of the United States in 

1991, and which included the rescheduling of all the 

stereochemical variants of THC.<a href="#6">6</a>  E/1991/24 E/CN.7/1991/26, 24 

May 1991.  The United States is bound by this treaty and the

     <a name="4">4</a>    Pursuant to a telphone conversation of November 27, 
1995, with John P. Morgan, Professor of Pharmacology, City 
Univerity of New York, Medical School, Room J903, 138th Street at 
Convent Avenue, New York, New York 10031; telephone (212) 650-
8255.  Professor Morgan stated that heroin does not occur 
naturally in the opium poppy.  Heroin is a semi-synthetic 
derivative of morphine.
     <a name="5">5</a>    <i>Id</i>. Professor Morgan, footnote 4, supra.  Professor 
Morgan also stated that alphacetylmethadol is not a naturally 
occuring substances.  It is made synthetically.
     <a name="6">6</a>    This international rescheduling included all four 
isomers of delta-9-THC, along with all other forms of THC found 
in the plant, e.g., those found in 21 C.F.R.  1308.11(d)(25).


                              - 3 -
<hr>amendment pursuant to the <i>Psychotropic Substances Act</i>, Pub. L. 

95-633, November 10, 1978.  This international rescheduling 

procedure allowed the United States to reschedule dronabinol, 

although the DEA is claiming that only the specific isomer 

dronabinol (and only when made synthetically) in sesame oil and 

encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule was actually rescheduled.

     The petitioner's original petition and brief did not tell 

the DEA that rescheduling of dronabinol was being sought, because 

it was implicit in the argument that marijuana should be 

rescheduled.  The petitioner argued that dronabinol had already 

been rescheduled to Schedule II, and, therefore, marijuana is now 

the source of a Schedule II substance, dronabinol.  Contrary to 

the DEA's assertions, this issue is not being raised for the 

first time on judicial review.  The DEA could have asked for 

clarification, if it was unsure of the grounds for the petition.

     The fact that no cite case law was cited in the Petitioner's 

original brief does not mean that none existed.  All of the ideas 

expressed in the petitioner's original petition and brief were 

taken from prior decisions of this court in <i>United States v.</i> 

<i>Walton</i>, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C. Cir. 1975), <i>National Organization for</i> 

<i>the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Drug Enforcement Administration</i>, 

559 F.2d. 735 (D.C. Cir. 1977), and <i>Alliance for Cannabis</i> 

<i>Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration</i>, 930 F.2d 936 

(D.C. Cir. 1991).  There is nothing original about these 

arguments, as they were all presented by this court in these 

three cases.


                              - 4 -
<hr>     On page 3 of its brief, the DEA talks about 20 years of 

rescheduling petitions, all of which have been appealed and 

denied.  The DEA fails to mention that none of these previous 

petitions raised the issue presented here.  In all of the cases 

cited by the DEA, the petitioners were seeking either 

recreational, medical, or sacramental use of the marijuana plant, 

in its natural form.  The matter presently before this court 

seeks none of these, and that's why the issue presented here has 

never been raised before, even though it was invited by this 

court in <i>National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</i> 

<i>v. Drug Enforcement Administration</i>, 559 F.2d 735, 748 (D.C. Cir. 

1977).

     If this case is successful in transferring marijuana from 

Schedule I to Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 

the most that could be hoped for is that dronabinol could be 

extracted from marijuana, rather than being made entirely 

synthetically.  Both cocaine and morphine can be made 

synthetically, but neither of them are commonly made that way.  

It is more economical to extract cocaine and morphine from their 

natural sources (the plants they come from, coca and opium 

poppy).<a href="#7">7</a>  The trend is to go with extraction, rather than 

synthesis.

     The United States government currently grows marijuana under 

contract with the University of Mississippi, and it could easily

Morgan also stated that aspirin is not even made synthetically,

source.

<hr>license others to manufacture marijuana for the purpose of 

extracting dronabinol.  In 1942, the federal government actually 

exempted farmers from military service if they agreed to grow 

marijuana for the production of hemp fiber during World War II.  

Marijuana is still mentioned as a strategic military resource in 

Section 901(e) of the Executive Order 12919 of June 3, 1994 

(National Defense Industrial Resources Preparedness).

     The penalties for illegal possession of a Schedule II 

substance are no different from those for illegal possession of a 

Schedule I substance.  Therefore, there is no valid enforcement 

concern for the Drug Enforcement Administration, because the 

DEA's mission is strictly one of enforcement.  <i>United States v.</i> 

<i>Moore</i>, 423 U.S. 122, 135 (1972).  As the DEA Administrator stated 

in 1992, "Clearly, the Controlled Substances Act does not 

authorize the Attorney General, nor by delegation the DEA 

Administrator, to make the ultimate decision as to whether a drug 

should be used as medicine."  57 Fed. Reg. 10,499, 10,505 (March 

26, 1992).  Rescheduling marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II 

would not set any precedent for further rescheduling, nor would 

it lead to increased drug diversion when the strict Schedule II 

requirements for manufacture are met.<a href="#8">8</a> 

     Although the DEA in its brief continually refers to the 

statutory criteria for scheduling set forth in 21 U.S.C.  

812(b)(2) Schedule II, and is quick to point out that marijuana 

____________________
     <a name="8">8</a>    Manufacturers would be required to meet the same 
standards as those currently employed by the federal government's 
marijuana farm at the University of Mississippi.


                              - 6 -
<hr>fails to satisfy any of them, it completely sweeps under the rug 

the fact that coca and opium poppy, both Schedule II substances, 

also fail to satisfy any of them.  The DEA refers to the plain 

meaning of the statute, but fails to explain this obvious 

inconsistency between its argument and the plain wording of the 

statute.  Congress was clearly using other factors to determine 

scheduling, which this court properly recognized in 1977.  <i>Id</i>. 

<i>NORML v. DEA</i>, 559 F.2d at 748.

     To be fair, the DEA has admitted there is an inconsistency 

in its argument.  In footnote 9, on page 16 of its brief, the DEA 

admits that some courts, including this one, have found that the 

scheduling criteria in 21 U.S.C.  812 are neither cumulative nor 

exclusive.  However, the DEA gives two reasons why these doubts 

should be resolved in its favor.

     First, the DEA claims that the dicta in these cases were 

overruled by this court's decisions in <i>Alliance for Cannabis</i> 

<i>Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement Administration</i>, 15 F.3d 1131, 

1133 (D.C. Cir. 1991), and <i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v.</i> 

<i>Drug Enforcement Administration</i>, 930 F.2d 936, 938-940 (D.C. Cir. 

1994).  The problem with the DEA's reasoning is that the issue in 

this case was not raised by the <i>Alliance for Cannabis</i> 

<i>Therapeutics</i> cases, and, therefore, it is not res judicata in 

this matter.

     The second argument given by the DEA is that this court 

should give deference to the DEA's interpretation of the statute 

because of the guidelines for statutory interpretation 

articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Chevron , U.S.A, Inc. v.</i> 


                              - 7 -
<hr><i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  

Again, the problem with this reasoning is that <i>Chevron</i> requires 

this court to first look at the plain meaning of the statute.  

This court must first resolve the inconsistency of the scheduling 

of coca and opium poppy under the statute.  According to the 

DEA's reasoning, neither coca and opium poppy could be scheduled 

in Schedule II of the statute.  The DEA has never moved to 

correct this inconsistency by attempting to reschedule coca and 

opium poppy to Schedule I.  Therefore, it is obvious that the DEA 

has failed to properly interpret the statute in this matter.

     The DEA admits that, in drafting the statute, Congress was 

aware that coca and opium poppy were the sources of accepted 

medicines, but fails to acknowledge that this creates an 

additional scheduling criterion (being the natural plant source 

of an accepted medicine), and that Congress was equally aware 

that marijuana was not the source of any accepted medicine at the 

time the Controlled Substances Act was written.  Things have 

changed.  Marijuana is now the source of an accepted medicine, 

even though the DEA makes an artificial distinction between the 

synthetic and the naturally extracted equivalent of the drug.  

Coca and opium poppy are the evidence that Congress did not 

consider the scheduling of plants and their included chemicals to 

be distinct, and the DEA half-heartedly admits as much.<a href="#9">9</a> 
____________________
     <a name="9">9</a>    It is important to note that coca, opium, and marijuana 
plants are not only the source of accepted medicines, but those 
medicines are all the principle psychoactive drugs contained 
within those plants.  In other words, these plants are only 
medically active (psychoactive) to the extent they contain these 
drugs.  Of course, that is not to say that these plants have no 


                              - 8 -
<hr>     There is no difference between a synthetic drug and its 

naturally extracted twin.  By definition, a synthetic molecule 

must be identical to its natural equivalent.  The Food and Drug 

Administration verifies this fact.  A. 16.  Synthetic dronabinol 

and the (-)-delta-9-(trans)-THC found in the marijuana plant are 

the same thing.  The DEA is saying that only synthetic dronabinol 

in sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules has been 

rescheduled, and the Code of Federal Regulations actually 

distinguishes (wrongly) synthetic from naturally occurring 

dronabinol (as if synthetic and naturally occurring drugs were 

not the exact same thing).  21 C.F.R.  1308.11(f)(1).  However, 

the DEA is saying that dronabinol itself was not transferred from 

Schedule I to Schedule II of the CSA.  The DEA claims that only a 

pharmaceutical product, dronabinol (synthetic) in sesame oil and 

encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, was transferred to 

Schedule II.

     On page 21 of its brief, the DEA briefly mentions <i>Grinspoon</i> 

<i>v. Drug Enforcement Administration</i>, 828 F.2d 881, 891-892 (1st 

Cir. 1987), but completely fails to mention its subsequent 

approval by this court in <i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v.</i> 

<i>Drug Enforcement Administration</i>, 930 F.2d 936, 939-940 (D.C. Cir. 

1991).  The <i>Grinspoon</i> court held that the DEA cannot rely on FDA 

marketing approval in making scheduling decisions.  While it is 

true, as the DEA points out in footnote 13, on page 21 of its 

brief, that FDA marketing approval is sufficient to establish 
_________________________________________________________________
other medicinal qualities, just none that are presently 
recognized by the medical profession.


                              - 9 -
<hr>accepted medical use, the DEA fails to acknowledge that lack of 

FDA marketing approval does not necessitate a finding that the 

substance has no medical use.  <i>Alliance</i>, 930 F.2d at 939; 

<i>Grinspoon</i>, 828 F.2d at 891.  As this court wrote in 1977,

     If, as respondent contends, a determination that the 
     substance has no accepted medical use ends the inquiry, 
     then presumably Congress would have spelled that out in 
     its procedural guidelines.  Its failure to do so 
     indicates an intent to reserve to HEW a finely tuned 
     balancing process involving several medical and 
     scientific considerations.

<i>NORML</i>, 559 F.2d at 748.  It would be ludicrous to assume that 

dronabinol has no medical value unless it is in sesame oil and 

encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules, or that it would have no 

medical value if it were extracted from a marijuana plant.

     It is interesting to note in footnote 7, on page 11, and, 

again on page 14 of the DEA's brief, that the DEA recognizes that 

Congress had strong doubts about placing marijuana in Schedule I 

and fully intended that further research would clarify this 

matter.  Further research has indeed revealed that marijuana has 

at least as much therapeutic value as coca and opium poppy.  

     It is also disturbing how the DEA ignores the holdings in 

<i>United States v. Walton</i>, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  This 

court specifically held that marijuana was illegal only to the 

extent that it contained THC.  This court interpreted the plain 

meaning of the statute, as well as its history in the <i>Marihuana</i> 

<i>Tax Act</i> of 1937, and determined that it was plain from the face 

of the statute that THC<a href="#10">10</a> was the controlling factor in 
____________________
     <a name="10">10</a>   The term "THC", as used by this court, referred to 
dronabinol, since it is the only isomer of delta-9-THC which is 


                              - 10 -
<hr>marijuana's scheduling.  The DEA seems to think this holding has 

been overruled by subsequent decisions in <i>Alliance for Cannabis</i> 

<i>Therapeutics v. DEA</i>, 930 F.2d 936, and <i>Alliance for Cannabis</i> 

<i>Therapeutics v. DEA</i>, 15 F.3d 1131.  Again, the issues raised were 

not the same, and neither of the <i>Alliance</i> rulings are res 

judicata as to the issue presented here.

     In footnote 10, on page 16 of its brief, the DEA makes an 

interesting analogy to a substance by the name of levo-

alphacetylmethadol.  This is a great analogy, because it's almost 

exactly the same situation as we have with levo-(trans)-delta-9-

THC.  The other three isomers of delta-9-THC are psychoactively 

inactive.  In other words, they have little, if any, medical 

value, which means that it's highly unlikely they will ever be 

rescheduled to Schedule II (or below) under the DEA's currently 

proposed (and faulty) standards.  It also means they have 

practically no abuse potential, which means that it's highly 

unlikely they would have ever been scheduled in Schedule I (or 

any schedule) if it had not been for their psychoactive 

counterpart (dronabinol).  As this court noted in <i>Walton</i>, it was 

the psychoactive isomer of delta-9-THC that caused marijuana to 

be outlawed in the first place.<a href="#11">11</a>  If none of the isomers of 

delta-9-THC were psychoactive, it would be highly unlikely that 

_________________________________________________________________
present in the marijuana plant, and it is the only form of THC 
which is psychoactive.
     <a name="11">11</a>   At the time <i>Walton</i> was decided, the term THC was used 
as if it were the same thing as dronabinol, because the levo-
(trans) isomer is the only isomer of delta-9-THC that is actually 
produced by the plant.  The other isomers can only be produced in 
a chemical laboratory.


                              - 11 -
<hr>Congress would ever have even thought of outlawing marijuana.  

Without the psychoactive isomer of delta-9-THC, marijuana is just 

another weed.

     Marijuana is the source of dronabinol, and not the source of 

the other three isomers of delta-9-THC.  Practically speaking, it 

is the levo-(trans) isomer of delta-9-THC that we are speaking of 

when we refer to delta-9-THC.  In the DEA's analogy, 

alphacetylmethadol would be the equivalent of delta-9-THC, and 

levo-alphacetylmethadol would be the equivalent of dronabinol.  

     Alphacetylmethadol doesn't come from a plant, it's made 

synthetically.<a href="#12">12</a>  If alphacetylmethadol came from a plant, that 

plant would only be controlled to the extent that it contained 

the psychoactive substance levo-alphacetylmethadol and not the 

other isomers of alphacetylmethadol which are psychoactively 

inactive.<a href="#13">13</a>  The difference between alphacetylmethadol and 

marijuana is that the former comes from a test tube and the 

latter comes from a seed.  The genesis of alphacetylmetadol is a 

test tube and the genesis of delta-9-THC is a plant.  The 

precedent for the treatment of plants has already been 

established by Congress in drafting the Controlled Substances 

Act.  The analogy breaks down, because alphacetylmethadol does 

not come from a plant.  Both alphacetylmethadol and the three 

non-dronabinol isomers of delta-9-THC can only be made 

synthetically.  However, dronabinol is produced either

<hr>synthetically or by a plant, while levo-alphacetylmethadol can 

only be made synthetically.

     One last point that should be mentioned again is that the 

DEA originally sought to reschedule dronabinol itself.  50 Fed. 

Reg. 42,186 (Oct. 18, 1985).  On page 19 of the DEA's brief, the 

DEA incorrectly states that this proposal was only for synthetic 

dronabinol in sesame oil and encapsulated in a soft gelatin 

capsule.  The original proposal was for dronabinol itself, not a 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved product.  The actual 

rescheduling order changed the rescheduling to "dronabinol in 

sesame oil and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules."  51 Fed. 

Reg. 17,476 (1986).  This is not difficult to understand, because 

this action was prior to the 1987 ruling in <i>Grinspoon v. Drug</i> 

<i>Enforcement Administration</i>, 828 F.2d 881, 891-892 (1st Cir. 

1987), where the First Circuit ruled that the DEA could not rely 

solely on FDA marketing approval in making scheduling decisions.  

This court approved the holding of the <i>Grinspoon</i> court in 

<i>Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. Drug Enforcement</i> 

<i>Administration</i>, 930 F.2d 936, 939-940 (D.C. Cir. 1991).

     The DEA's assertion that dronabinol was not rescheduled, 

along with its assertion that marijuana is not the source of an 

accepted medicine are false.  Evidence of the DEA's error is the 

list of controlled substances contained in Schedule I and 

Schedule II in the Code of Federal Regulations at 21 C.F.R.  

1308.11 and 1308.12.  Dronabinol is the only substance that 

contains the following added language:



                              - 13 -
<hr>     (synthetic) in sesame oil and encapsulated in a soft 
     gelating capsule in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
     approved drug product

21 C.F.R.  1308.11(f)(1).  Every other substance in Schedule I 

and Schedule II is identified only by its chemical name.<a href="#14">14</a>  The 

addition of sesame oil and gelatin capsules does nothing to 

change the nature of the substance dronabinol.  In the 

petitioner's brief attached to the original petition filed with 

the DEA, the substance identified is dronabinol, not a U.S. Food 

and Drug Administration approved product.


     
        <b>FAILURE TO FOLLOW PROPER ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE</b>

     Since the DEA is concerned about following proper 

administrative procedure, it should be noted that the DEA has 

failed to follow proper administrative procedure on numerous 

occasions, particularly in four cases (three in which the 

petitioner has been a party).  <i>National Organization for the</i> 

<i>Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Ingersoll</i>, 497 F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 

1974) (case remanded because DEA refused to accept a rescheduling 

petition); <i>Carl Eric Olsen v. Drug Enforcement Administration</i>, 

776 F.2d 267 (11th Cir. 1985) (DEA scolded for refusing to 

respond to a rescheduling petition); <i>Carl Eric Olsen v. Drug</i> 
____________________
     <a name="14">14</a>   Admittedly, there is some cross-scheduling of 
substances in the lower schedules (e.g., codeine is in Schedule 
II, while codeine diluted to "not more than 200 milligrams of 
codeine per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams" is in Schedule V), 
but such cross-scheduling involves diluted forms of the same 
drug.  It is important to note that codeine is in Schedule II, 
not Schedule I, because it has medical use.  To suggest that 
codeine be included in Schedule I unless it is in sesame oil and 
encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules would be absurd.  It is 
also important to note that there is no cross-scheduling between 
Schedule I and Schedule II (with the exception of dronabinol).


                              - 14 -
<hr><i>Enforcement Administration</i>, 878 F.2d 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1989) 

(petitioner had to file for a writ of mandamus to compel the DEA 

to accept a rescheduling petition, and case later remanded 

because DEA failed to properly address the issues raised); <i>Carl</i> 

<i>Eric Olsen v. Drug Enforcement Administration</i>, No. 93-1109 (D.C. 

Cir. Dec. 9, 1993) (case remanded because DEA refused to accept a 

rescheduling petition).  This record shows that the DEA has made 

a consistent effort to obstruct justice and deny petitioners the 

first amendment constitutional right to petition government for a 

redress of grievances.


                           <b>CONCLUSION</b>

     The regulations of the DEA clearly state that a petition to 

reschedule can be brought by any interested party.  21 C.F.R.  

1307.03.  It is important that citizens be encouraged to keep an 

eye on government officials; in fact, it is a civil duty.  It is 

not the function of the government to keep the citizen from 

falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the 

government from falling into error.

     The DEA improperly failed to reschedule marijuana and 

dronabinol when it rescheduled the pharmaceutical equivalent of 

dronabinol.  The DEA improperly refused to reschedule marijuana 

when this error was brought to its attention.  The appropriate 

remedy is for this court to order that marijuana and dronabinol 

are both included within Schedule II of the Controlled Substances 

Act of 1970.

REGULATORY BACKGROUND</b></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">In 1970 Congress passed the Controlled
Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801 et seq. (&quot;C.S.A.&quot;).&nbsp; The
C.S.A. classifies various substances into five schedules.&nbsp;
21 U.S.C. 812.&nbsp; Restrictions upon use and access to a
particular drug vary based upon the drug's schedule status in the
C.S.A.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; Drugs in Schedule I are subject to
more severe restrictions than drugs in the other schedules.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>Alliance
for Cannabis Therapeutics (hereinafter &quot;A.C.T.&quot;) v.
Drug Enforcement Administration ( hereinafter &quot;D.E.A.&quot;)</u>,
930 F.2d 936, 937(D.C. Cir. 1991).&nbsp; Congress placed
marijuana in schedule I of the C.S.A. 21 U.S.C. 812(c), schedule
I(c)(10). </font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">Although Congress made the initial scheduling
decisions, the C.S.A. specifically permits the Attorney General
to add a substance to a schedule, transfer a substance from one
schedule to another or remove a substance from the schedules
entirely.&nbsp; 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1).</font><a

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">The Attorney General may only add or transfer a
substance to a different schedule if she &quot;finds that such
drug or other substance has a potential for abuse&quot; and makes
findings that the drug or substance meets the requirements for
the new schedule.&nbsp; <u>See</u> 21 U.S.C. 811 (1)(a)and
(b).&nbsp; Section 812(b) of Article 21 of the United States Code
sets out the findings required to place a substance in a
particular schedule.&nbsp; 21 U.S.C. 812(b).&nbsp; The Attorney
General has delegated the authority to reschedule controlled
substances to the Administrator of the D.E.A.&nbsp; 28 C.F.R.
0.100(b).&nbsp; The Drug Enforcement Administrator (hereinafter
&quot;Administrator&quot;) has further delegated this authority
to the Deputy Administrator of the D.E.A.&nbsp; 28 C.F.R. 0.104.</font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">The C.S.A. provides that any interested party
may petition to have a substance added to, removed or transferred

to the rule making procedures of the administrative Procedures
Act found in Title 5.&nbsp; 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(2); 5 U.S.C.

obligated to respond to all petitions for the issuance, amendment
or repeal of rules pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811 and by 21 C.F.R.
1308.44 (C) which provides that within a reasonable time after the
receipt of a petition, the administrator shall notify the
petitioner of his acceptance or nonacceptance of the petition,

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">Section 811(b) of Article 21 of the United
States Code, titled Evaluation of Drugs and Other Substances,
clearly states that the Attorney General must, after gathering
all the necessary data, request from the Secretary a scientific

such drug or other substance should be so controlled.&nbsp; 21
U.S.C. 811 (b).&nbsp; These recommendations are binding upon the
Attorney General.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; The clear mandate of the
statute and case precedent make it clear that the D.E.A. is not

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">The D.E.A.&#146;s stubborn refusal to exercise

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">These cases originated from one petition filed
with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD),
predecessor to the D.E.A..&nbsp; On May 18, 1972 NORML filed the
petition seeking to have marijuana removed from the C.S.A. or in
the alternative transferred to schedule II.&nbsp; <u>NORML</u>,
497 F.2d at 655.&nbsp; As a result of BNDD&#146;s refusal to
accept the petition for filing, NORML sued.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>. at
656.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals ordered the D.E.A. to accept the
petition and respond on the merits.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>. at
661.&nbsp; Thereafter, D.E.A. Administrator skirted the
statutorily mandated recommendation from the secretary of HEW,
ignored the findings of Administrative Law Judge Parker and
denied the petition in all respects.&nbsp; 40 Fed.Reg. 44164,
44168 (1975); <u>NORML</u>, 559 F.2d at 742-43.&nbsp; The Court

rescheduling.&nbsp; <u>NORML</u>, 559 F.2d at 757. </font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">Forced to follow proper procedure, D.E.A.
issued a notice of a hearing on the rescheduling petition in
1986.&nbsp; <u>See</u> 51 Fed. Reg. 22,946 (1986).&nbsp;
Administrative Law Judge Young conducted extensive proceedings
and found that marijuana enjoyed a current accepted medical use
and therefore could be placed in schedule II.&nbsp; <u>A.C.T.</u>,
930 F.2d at 938. Rejecting the evidence and disagreeing with
Judge Young&#146;s conclusions, the D.E.A. Administrator
reaffirmed his prior order stating that marijuana should not be
moved from schedule I because the marijuana plant has no currently
accepted medical use.&nbsp; <u>See</u> 54 Fed. Reg. 53,767,
53,784 (1989).&nbsp; In making this determination, previous
Administrator Lawn listed several criteria used for determining
accepted medical use, and declared that marijuana failed to meet
them.&nbsp; <u>See</u> 57 Fed. Reg. at 10,507-10,508.</font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">As the issue became more narrowly focused,
A.C.T. became the lead petitioner in the case.&nbsp; A.C.T., and
other parties seeking rescheduling, advanced the argument that
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 812(b)(2)(B), marijuana has an accepted
medical use in the United States and therefore should be rescheduled.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>A.C.T.</u>,
930 F.2d at 939.</font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">A.C.T. appealed the order for a second time.
The Appeals Court remanded the case yet again on the grounds that
the criteria the Administrator used to determine currently
accepted medical use were impossible to satisfy.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>A.C.T.</u>,
930 F.2d at 940-941.</font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">Reconsidering the issue yet again, the new
Administrator explained that the prior Administrator had not
relied on two of the three impermissible criteria and clarified
the third criteria.&nbsp; 57 Fed. Reg. 10,507, 10,499 (1992); <u>A.C.T.
v. D.E.A.</u>, 15 F.3d. 1131 (D.C. Cir. 1994).&nbsp; According to Administrator
Bonner, the two criteria not considered were the general
availability of the substance and the use of the substance by a
substantial segment of medical practitioners.&nbsp; 57 Fed. Reg.,
at 10,499 (1992).&nbsp; He further argued that the recognition of
clinical use in generally accepted pharmacopeia rested on a
determination by the previous administrator that marijuana lacked
a known, reproducible chemistry.&nbsp; <u>A.C.T.</u>, 15 F.3d. at
1135.&nbsp; Thus, a new five part test for determining whether a
drug had a currently accepted medical use was created.</font><a
href="footnotes.html#2"><font size="2"><sup>2</sup></font></a><font

findings he upheld the decision that marijuana plants should
remain in schedule I.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals
upheld the Order, finding that the D.E.A. had properly clarified
its test for accepted medical use.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>. at 10,499; <u>See

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">As the issue proceeded through the courts,
tangential consideration was given to the difference between
synthetic THC and THC found naturally in marijuana.&nbsp; 54 Fed.
Reg. at 53,774.&nbsp; In the Final Order on the petition,
Administrator Bonner adopted the findings of former Administrator Lawn
who stated there is no difference in the pharmacological effect
between THC isolated from cannabis and the synthetically produced
THC which is now marketed in the United States.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; Administrator
Lawn&#146;s conclusion concurred with prior findings made by
H.H.S. that the pharmaceutical qualities of synthetic delta-9-THC
are the same as those of delta-9-THC itself.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp;
Following isolation and characterization of delta-9-THC as the
major active component of marijuana by Mechoulam and colleagues,
a technique for producing synthetic material was developed.&nbsp;

&quot;F.D.A.&quot;) for marketing purposes, does not make
Dronabinol into another drug for scheduling purposes.&nbsp; In 1986,
Health and Human Services (H.H.S.) recognized that synthetic
delta-9-THC is the same as its naturally occurring twin.&nbsp; 51

<p><font size="3"><b>II.&nbsp; THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS</b></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">On July 21, 1992, noting several
inconsistencies between the Order and prior findings of fact and
law, the petitioner sent a letter to then-Administrator Robert C.
Bonner in which he raised several questions about the
Administrator's final order.&nbsp; Specifically, petitioner asked
why coca and opium poppy plants are scheduled in Schedule II of
the C.S.A., since both of these plants are subject to the same
variances in chemistry as the marijuana plant and neither are
reproducible in standardized dosages. (25a);<u> See</u> 57 Fed.
Reg. 10,499. </font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">On August 17, 1992, Administrator Bonner sent
the petitioner a response to his letter.&nbsp; In the response,
the Administrator rejected the petitioner's attempt to analogize
marijuana plants to coca and opium plants. (26a).&nbsp; The
Administrator explained that when Congress placed coca leaves and opium
plant materials in Schedule II, it was aware that these plants
had been recognized historically as the source for a variety of
accepted and useful medications.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; The
plants contain medically active alkaloids that can be extracted
and used to produce pharmaceutical compounds capable of reproduction
in standardized doses.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; In contrast, the
Administrator pointed out that the recent attempts to reschedule
marijuana were not grounded on claims that medically useful
compounds could be extracted from marijuana, but rather that
smoking marijuana itself produced medical benefits.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp;
Thus, the Administrator found the scheduling decisions to be
reconcilable.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>. </font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">Interpreting the Administrator's statements
regarding the scheduling of coca and opium poppy plants as
general rules of statutory construction, the petitioner,
proceeding pro se, then filed a formal request for the
rescheduling of marijuana pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811 and 21 C.F.R. 1307.03
in the form prescribed by 21 C.F.R. 1308.44(b).&nbsp; The
petition was based on the grounds that Dronabinol,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the principle
psychoactive substance in the marijuana plant, was rescheduled to
schedule II of the C.S.A. in 1986, and, therefore, because
marijuana is the source of Dronabinol, it should have been moved
into the same schedule as Dronabinol.(27-28a) <u>See</u> Final
Order of the Drug Enforcement Administration, May 13, 1986: 51
Fed. Reg. 17,476 (placing Dronabinol in schedule II). </font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">In an order dated May 16, 1992, Deputy
Administrator Greene refused to accept the petition for filing on
the basis of his finding that Dronabinol is a wholly synthetic
substance and is not obtained from marijuana.&nbsp; Despite
refusing to accept the petition for filing, the administrator proceeded
to reject the issues raised in the petition on their
merits.&nbsp; The Deputy Administrator responded to the petition
stating only the pharmaceutical product was transferred from
schedule I to schedule II, i.e., Dronabinol in sesame oil and
encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule in a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved drug product.&nbsp; No rescheduling
action was taken with regard to (-) delta-9-trans-THC, i.e.,
Dronabinol, which remains in Schedule I of the C.S.A..&nbsp; The Deputy
Administrator further explained under the C.S.A., the regulation
of chemicals and the plant material are distinct from each
other.&nbsp; The classification of delta-9-THC has no bearing on
the classification of marijuana. Under the C.S.A., a proposed
change in the schedule of either a tetrahydrocannabinol or the
plant marijuana requires the Attorney General to proceed independently.&nbsp; <u>See</u>
21 U.S.C. 811.</font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">Petitioner appealed the Deputy
Administrator&#146;s denial of the petition to the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.&nbsp; <u>Olsen
v. D.E.A.</u>, No. 93-1109 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 9, 1993).&nbsp;
Familiar with Appellate Court frustration toward the D.E.A. in
such matters, the D.E.A. requested a remand for a formal ruling
on the petition.&nbsp; Order dated December 9, 1993.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>Olsen

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">Without seeking advice from the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, (hereinafter &quot;H.H.S.&quot;)
Deputy Administrator Stephen H. Greene issued a nine-page Final
Order denying the petition. (2-8a)&nbsp; In the Final Order Mr.
Greene rejected the petitioner's analogy, finding that marijuana
can only be moved from schedule I if there is a finding that
marijuana has a &quot;currently accepted medical use in treatment
in the United States.&quot; (6a) The order acknowledged that (-)delta-9-trans-THC
isomer, the principal psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, is
also the ingredient in a pharmaceutical product that has proven
to be a safe and effective anti-emetic for patients receiving
cancer chemotherapy.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; Even so, only a very
specific synthetic Dronabinol product was rescheduled to schedule
II --&quot;Dronabinol&quot; (synthetic) in sesame oil and
encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule&quot; in a drug product
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (hereinafter &quot;F.D.A.&quot;).
(5-7a) </font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">According to his interpretation of the statute,
Administrator Greene further stated that the regulation of plants
and chemicals under the C.S.A. is distinct and that the C.S.A.
requires the independent evaluation of each individual controlled
substance.&nbsp; Thus he concluded, because marijuana plants have
no currently accepted medical use in treatment, the rescheduling
of one pharmaceutical product did not require D.E.A. to transfer
marijuana plants or any other substance to schedule II. (6-7a)</font></p>

determined in considering whether a substance had a currently accepted
medical use. (26a); <u>See</u> <u>also</u> 57 Fed. Reg.

inquiry based on the aforementioned definition, Administrator
Bonner differentiated the schedule II placement of coca and opium
from the schedule I placement of the marijuana on the grounds
that the coca and opium plants were the basis for useful
medications and that neither of the plants were used in their
plant form as medicine. (26a)&nbsp; In both cases, medically
useful alkaloids are extracted from the plant materials after
which a pharmaceutical compound capable of reproduction in
standardized doses are produced.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; Unlike
medications derived from opium and coca plants, he argued, the

Deputy Administrator Green successfully distracted the court by
turning the argument to the issue of whether or not Dronabinol
itself was a schedule I drug. (5-6a)&nbsp; He argued that
Dronabinol was scheduled in schedule II only when in sesame oil
and encapsulated in soft gelatin capsules.&nbsp; Administrator
Green found that the rescheduling of synthetic Dronabinol in a

the rescheduling of THC in sesame oil had no effect on the rescheduling
of marijuana contradicts D.E.A.&#146;s prior finding that H.E.W.
recommends moving THC to schedule II should it become the source
of an approved new drug application.&nbsp; 50 Fed. Reg.
42186.&nbsp; Furthermore, during prior rescheduling hearings the
D.E.A. agreed that synthetic THC, which D.E.A. claims is the main
substance in Dronabinol, did not need to be controlled under the
C.S.A. 40 Fed. Reg. 44164, 44168 (1975).&nbsp; During further
proceedings, the Administrator took special note that synthetic
THC was in schedule I.&nbsp; 51 Fed. Reg. 17477.&nbsp; Indicative
of D.E.A.&#146;s own confusion in this area, when answering the

proscription.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>. at 191.&nbsp; These cases have
recognized implied rights that have little or no textual support
in the constitutional language.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; The rights
which qualify for heightened judicial protection include
fundamental liberties so implicit in the concept of ordered
liberty that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were
sacrificed.&nbsp; <u>Palko v. Connecticut</u>, 302 U.S. 319, 325-24
(1937).&nbsp; Fundamental liberties have also been described as
those that are deeply rooted in this nations history and
tradition.&nbsp; <u>Moore v. City of East Cleveland</u>, 431 U.S.
479,506 (1965)(White,J., concurring). The government may not
infringe upon a fundamental liberty unless the infringement is
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government
interest.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>Reno</u>, 507 U.S. 292.</font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">The right to privacy has been found to
encompass personal decisions relating to marriage, family, and
education.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>Carey v. Population Services
Int&#146;l</u>, 431 U.S. 678, 684-85 (1977).&nbsp; While the
constitution does not include any explicit mention of the right
to privacy, this right has been judicially recognized.&nbsp; <u>Carey</u>,
431 U.S. at 684.&nbsp; In previous decisions, courts have found
that smoking marijuana was not a fundamental right because it did
not involve any important values inherent in questions involving
marriage, procreation or child rearing.&nbsp; <u>See</u>, <u>NORML
v. Bell</u>, 488 F.Supp. 123, 133 (D.D.C. 1980).&nbsp; While
smoking marijuana itself may not be a fundamental right, the
right to choose appropriate medication involves the right of
every human being of sound mind and adult years to determine what
should or should not be done with their own body.&nbsp; <u>Casey</u>,112 S.Ct.
at 2807; <u>Whalen v. Roe</u>, 429 U.S. 599,600 (1977); <u>Schloendorff
v. Society of New York Hosp.</u>, 211 N.Y. 125, 129 (1914).&nbsp;
In the context of the medical use of marijuana, privacy rights are
implicated. </font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">In our system of a free government, where
notions of individual autonomy and free choice are cherished, it
is the individual who must have the final say in respect to
decisions regarding his medical treatment in order to insure that
the greatest possible protection is accorded his autonomy and
freedom from unwanted interference with the furtherance of his
own desires.&nbsp; <u>Rivers v. Katz</u>, 67 N.Y.2d
485,493(1986).&nbsp; This court has repeatedly recognized that
the Constitution places limits on government interference with a
person&#146;s most basic decisions about bodily integrity.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Casey</u>,
431 U.S at 684; <u>Roe v. Wade</u> 410 U.S. 113,152 (1973).</font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">By foreclosing the rescheduling process, the
D.E.A.&#146;s decision amounts to government intrusion in matters
involving the most intimate and personal choices a patient may
make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and
autonomy and which are central to the liberty protected by the
Fifth Amendment.&nbsp; U.S. Const. Amend IX; <u>Casey</u> 211
S.Ct. at 2807. </font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">Because fundamental personal liberty interests
are involved, they may not be abridged by the government simply
on a showing that a regulatory statute has some rational
relationship to the effectuation of a proper government
purpose.&nbsp; <u>Poe v. Ullman</u>, 367 U.S. at 543.&nbsp; Where
there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the
government may prevail only upon showing a subordinate interest
which is compelling.&nbsp; <u>Bates v. City of Little Rock</u>,
361 U.S. 516, 524 (1960).&nbsp; The law must be shown to be
necessary and not merely rationally related to the accomplishment
of a permissible government policy.&nbsp; <u>McLaughlin, v. State
of Florida</u>, 379 U.S. 184,196 (1964 ) ; <u>See</u> <u>e.g.</u>, <u>Schneider</u>,
308 U.S. at 161.&nbsp; Because the D.E.A. is unable to show any
compelling purpose which is served by differentiating between the
THC found in a plant and the same exact THC encapsulated in
sesame oil and gelatin, the order refusing to reschedule
marijuana to schedule II should be struck down because it
unnecessarily infringes on medical THC users privacy
rights.&nbsp; <u>Casey</u>, 112 S.Ct. at 2805.</font></p>

legislative facts on which a classification is based could not
reasonably be conceived to be true by the governmental decision
maker the classification cannot be said to be rationally related

440 U.S. 93, 111 (1979).&nbsp; The D.E.A. cannot reasonably
believe distinguishing between a substance coated in gelatin and
sesame oil and one that is not, will prevent the abuse of the
substance.&nbsp; <u>See</u> 51 Fed. Reg. 17476.&nbsp;
Furthermore, both the courts and the D.E.A. have previously found
that THC is the only reason the marijuana plant is controlled in
schedule I.&nbsp; <u>Walton</u>, 514 F.2d at 204 n.12.&nbsp; As
the Appeals Court noted in 1991, one of the very purposes in
placing a drug in schedule I is to raise significant barriers to
prevent doctors from obtaining the drugs too easily.&nbsp; <u>A.C.T.</u>,

sought to prevent doctors from obtaining is a legally
prescribable substance, in schedule II, the purpose no longer
exists.&nbsp; 21 U.S.C.811(a).&nbsp; To doggedly refuse to
reschedule the marijuana plant to schedule II is a decision not
rationally related to controlling THC and does not serve the
purpose of drug abuse prevention.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>Walton</u>,

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">Where a decision is predicated upon a
particular state of facts, it can also be challenged by showing
the Court that those facts are no longer true.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>Abie
State Bank v. Bryan</u>, 282 U.S. 765 (1931).&nbsp; In a prior
decisions, courts have noted that Congress&#146;s original
placement of marijuana in schedule I was premised upon the fact
that H.E.W. recommended it be placed there.&nbsp; <u>Bell</u>,
488 F.Supp. 134.&nbsp; The letter from H.E.W. suggesting that
synthetic marijuana, which H.E.W. has placed in schedule II, is
no different than the natural THC found in schedule I, coupled
with the D.E.A<b>.</b>&#146;s own recognition that both synthetic
THC and natural THC are the same substance, should demonstrate to
this court that the facts upon which marijuana was placed in
schedule I have ceased to exist. (24a)</font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><font size="3">As previously noted, a drug must meet five
criteria to remain in schedule I.&nbsp; 21 U.S.C. 811(a).&nbsp;
The most contested of these criteria is the requirement that the
substance does not have an accepted medical use.&nbsp; <u>A.C.T</u>,
930 F.2d at 936.&nbsp; Like the coca and opium plants, the
marijuana plant is now recognized as the source of a compound
which is utilized as the basis of a useful medication.&nbsp; 51
Fed. Reg. 17476.&nbsp; The THC isomer, which has been judicially
recognized as the ingredient which originally caused marijuana to
be placed in schedule I, is now the source of a prescription
drug.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp; F.D.A. approval of a drug is
sufficient to establish the existence of an accepted medical
use.&nbsp; <u>A.C.T. v. D.E.A.</u>, 930 F.2d 936 (1991); <u>Grinspoon </u>,
828 F.2d at 891-92.&nbsp; Furthermore, the F.D.A.&#146;s study
and testing of this substance, in order to give it the status of
a new drug application, certainly satisfies the five criteria the
D.E.A. must follow in determining accepted medical use.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.&nbsp;
All of these factual changes demonstrate that the D.E.A. based
its decision not to reschedule marijuana, or even to hold
hearings to consider new evidence, on moot and outdated
information.&nbsp; <u>See</u> <u>Bell</u> 488 F.Supp. at
135-136.&nbsp; Therefore, the decision is no longer rational.&nbsp; <u>Id</u>.</font></p>

<p align="center"><tt>Proposition 215</tt></p>

<p align="center"><tt>Medical Marijuana Intiative</tt></p>

<p><tt>Section 1. Section 11362.5 is added to the Health and
Safety Code, to read:</tt></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><tt>11362.5. (a) This section shall be known and may be
    cited as the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.<br>
    <br>
    (b) (l) The people of the State of California hereby find and declare
    that the purposes of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 are as
    follows:</tt></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><tt>(A) To ensure that seriously ill Californians have
        the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical
        purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and
        has been recommended by a physician who has determined
        that the person's health would benefit from the use of
        marijuana in the treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS,
        chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or
        any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.<br>
        <br>
        (B) To ensure that patients and their primary caregivers
        who obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes upon
        the recommendation of a physician are not subject to
        criminal prosecution or sanction.<br>
        <br>
        (C) To encourage the federal and state governments to
        implement a plan to provide for the safe and affordable
        distribution of marijuana to all patients in medical need
        of marijuana.</tt></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><tt>(2) Nothing in this act shall be construed to
    supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in
    conduct that endangers others, nor to condone the diversion
    of marijuana for nonmedical purposes.</tt></p>
    <p><tt>(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no
    physician in this state shall be punished, or denied any
    right or privilege, for having recommended marijuana to a
    patient for medical purposes.<br>
    <br>
    (d) Section 11357, relating to the possession of marijuana, and
    Section 11358, relating to the cultivation of marijuana, shall
    not apply to a patient, or to a patient's primary caregiver,
    who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the personal
    medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral
    recommendation or approval of a physician.<br>
    <br>
    (e) For the purposes of this section, &quot;primary
    caregiver&quot; means the individual designated by the person
    exempted under this act who has consistently assumed
    responsibility for the housing, health, or safety of that
    person.</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>Sec. 2. If any provision of this measure or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or
applications of the measure which can be given effect without the
invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions
of this measure are severable.<br>

<P><CENTER>TEXT OF PROPOSED AMENDMENT</CENTER>

<P>Be it enacted by the people of the State of Arizona: The following amendments are proposed to become valid when approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon and upon proclamation pursuant thereto by the Governor of the State of Arizona.

<P>Section 1. TITLE

<P>THIS ACT SHALL BE KNOWN AND MAY BE CITED AS THE "DRUG MEDICALIZATION, PREVENTION, AND CONTROL ACT OF 1996."

<P>Section 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS

<P>THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA FIND AND DECLARE THE FOLLOWING:
<OL>
<LI> ARIZONA'S CURRENT APPROACH TO DRUG CONTROL NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED.
     THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT, ACCORDING TO THE ARIZONA CRIMINAL
     JUSTICE COMMISSION, BETWEEN 1991 AND 1993 MARIJUANA USE DOUBLED AMONG
     ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS AND, BETWEEN 1990 AND 1993 QUADRUPLED AMONG
     MIDDLE-SCHOOL STUDENTS. IN ADDITION TO ACTIVELY ENFORCING OUR CRIMINAL
     LAWS AGAINST DRUGS, WE NEED TO MEDICALIZE ARIZONA'S DRUG CONTROL
     POLICY: RECOGNIZING THAT DRUG ABUSE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND
     TREATING ABUSE AS A DISEASE. THUS, DRUG TREATMENT AND PREVENTION MUST
     BE EXPANDED.
<LI> WE MUST ALSO TOUGHEN ARIZONA'S LAWS AGAINST VIOLENT CRIMINALS ON DRUGS.
     ANY PERSON WHO COMMITS A VIOLENT CRIME WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
     ILLEGAL DRUGS SHOULD SERVE 100% OF HIS OR HER SENTENCE WITH ABSOLUTELY
     NO EARLY RELEASE.
<LI> THOUSANDS OF ARIZONANS SUFFER FROM DEBILITATING DISEASES SUCH AS
     GLAUCOMA, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, CANCER, AND AIDS, BUT CANNOT HAVE ACCESS
     TO THE NECESSARY DRUGS THEY NEED. ALLOWING DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE
     SCHEDULE I CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES COULD SAVE VICTIMS OF THESE DISEASES
     FROM LOSS OF SIGHT, LOSS OF PHYSICAL CAPACITY, AND GREATLY REDUCE THE
     PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THE SERIOUSLY ILL AND TERMINALLY ILL.
<LI> THE DRUG PROBLEMS OF NON-VIOLENT PERSONS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF PERSONAL
     POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS ARE BEST HANDLED THROUGH COURT-SUPERVISED
     DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE MORE
     EFFECTIVE THAN LOCKING NON-VIOLENT OFFENDERS UP IN A COSTLY PRISON.
     PILOT PROGRAMS IN ARIZONA THAT PROVIDE TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON
     FOR LOW LEVEL DRUG OFFENDERS HAVE A 73% SUCCESS RATE AND COST ROUGHLY
     1/8 AS MUCH AS PRISON. OVER THE NEXT DECADE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
     DOLLARS CAN BE SAVED BY USING MANDATORY DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION
     PROGRAMS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PRISON.
<LI> VIOLENT OFFENDERS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PUNISHED DUE TO THE PRISON
     OVER-CROWDING CRISIS IN ARIZONA. PLACING NON-VIOLENT PERSONS WHO ARE
     CONVICTED OF PERSONAL POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS IN COURT-SUPERVISED
     DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS WILL FREE UP SPACE IN OUR PRISONS
     SO THAT THERE IS ROOM TO INCARCERATE VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND DRUG
     DEALERS.
<LI> THE MISSING LINK IN DRUG EDUCATION AND PREVENTION IS PARENTAL
     INVOLVEMENT. THE TAX DOLLARS SAVED BY ELIMINATING PRISON TIME FOR
     NON-VIOLENT PERSONS CONVICTED OF PERSONAL POSSESSION OR USE OF DRUGS
     SHOULD BE USED FOR DRUG TREATMENT AND EDUCATION, TARGETED AT PROGRAMS
     THAT INCREASE PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR CHILDREN'S DRUG-EDUCATION.
</OL>
<P>Section 3. PURPOSE AND INTENT

<P>THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA DECLARE THEIR PURPOSES TO BE AS FOLLOWS:
<OL>
<LI> TO REQUIRE THAT ANY PERSON WHO COMMITS A VIOLENT CRIME UNDER THE
     INFLUENCE OF DRUGS SERVE 100 PERCENT OF HIS OR HER SENTENCE AND NOT BE
     ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE OR ANY FORM OF EARLY RELEASE.
<LI> TO PERMIT DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE SCHEDULE I CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES TO

the Act are severable.

<P><CENTER>ANALYSIS BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL</CENTER>

<P><CENTER>(In compliance with A.R.S. section 19-124)</CENTER>

<P>Proposition 200 would require that certain persons who are convicted of drug offenses be sentenced as follows:
<OL>
<LI> Require that persons who commit violent crimes while under the influence of drugs serve 100% of their sentences, without eligibility for parole.
<P>
<LI> Require that persons who have been convicted before the proposition
passes of the personal possession or use of a controlled substance such as
marijuana and who are serving their sentence in prison be released on
parole. A person is released on parole after serving time in jail or prison,
is under the supervision of a parole officer and may have his parole revoked
if any condition of parole is violated. The State Department of Corrections
would be required to establish a procedure for paroling these persons. The
Board of Executive Clemency would be required to release these persons
unless the Board determines that a person would be a danger to the general
public. Persons who are released on parole would be required to participate
in drug treatment or education.
<P>
<LI> Require that persons who are convicted after the proposition passes of
the personal possession or use of a controlled substance such as marijuana
be eligible for probation. A person who is sentenced to probation does not
serve any time in jail or prison, is under the supervision of a probation
officer and remains free as long as the person continues his good behavior.
A person on probation would be required to participate in a drug treatment
or education program.
</OL>
<P>Proposition 200 would allow medical doctors to prescribe a controlled
substance such as marijuana to treat a disease or to relieve the pain and
suffering of a seriously or terminally ill patient. The doctor must be able
to document that scientific research supports the use of the controlled
substance and must obtain a written opinion from a second doctor that
prescribing the controlled substance is appropriate. A patient who receives,
possesses or uses a controlled substance as prescribed by a doctor would not
be subject to criminal penalties.

<P>Proposition 200 would establish the Drug Treatment and Education Fund. These monies would come from a percentage of the luxury tax on alcohol, cigarettes and other tobacco products. 50% of these monies would be transferred to Superior Court probation departments to cover the costs of placing persons in drug education and treatment programs. The remaining 50% of the monies would be transferred to the Arizona Parents Commission on Drug Education and Prevention.

<P>Proposition 200 would establish an Arizona Parents Commission on Drug
Education and Prevention. The Commission would be responsible for funding
programs that increase and enhance parental involvement in drug education
and treatment.

<p>582 SOUTHERN REPORTER, 2d SERIES 676 </p>

<p><tt>Kenneth L. JENKS and Barbara J. Jenks, Appellants,
&nbsp;&nbsp;v. STATE of Florida, Appellee. </tt></p>

<p><tt>No. 90-2462. </tt></p>

<p><tt>District Court of Appeal of Florida, First District. </tt></p>

<p><tt>June 18, 1991. <br>
<br>
<br>
Defendants were convicted in the Circuit Court, Bay County,
Clinton Foster, J., of cultivating cannabis and possession of
drug paraphernalia, and they appealed.&nbsp; The District Court
of Appeal, Ervin, J., held that: (1) statute defining cannabis as
Schedule I substance did not preclude defense of medical
necessity, and (2) defendants established medical necessity
defense. </tt></p>

<p><tt>Reversed. </tt></p>

<p><tt>Nimmons, J., dissented. </tt></p>

<p><tt>1.&nbsp; Drugs and Narcotics 78 Statute defining cannabis
as Schedule I substance did not preclude defense of medical
necessity raised by defendant's charged with cultivating cannabis
and possession of drug paraphernalia, who allegedly used
marijuana to treat nausea which they suffered in connection with
their contraction of acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS).&nbsp; West's F.S.A.  893.03(1)(d). </tt></p>

<p>JENKS v. STATE Fla. 677 <br>
Cite as 582 So.2d 676 (Fla.App. 1 Dist. 1991) </p>

<p><tt>2.&nbsp; Drugs and Narcotics 78 Defendants charged with
cultivating cannabis and possession of drug paraphernalia
established medical necessity defense; medical expert and
physician testified that no other drug or treatment was available
that would effectively eliminate or diminish nausea suffered by
defendants, who had contracted acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS), and defendants established that if their nausea
was not controlled, their lives were in danger.&nbsp; West's
F.S.A.  893.13, 893.147. </tt></p>

<p><tt>3.&nbsp; Drugs and Narcotics 78 Elements of medical
necessity defense to use of controlled substance are: that
defendant did not intentionally bring about circumstances which
precipitated unlawful act; that defendant could not accomplish
same objective using less offensive alternative available to
defendant; and that evil sought to be avoided was more heinous
than unlawful act perpetrated to avoid it. </tt></p>

<p><tt>John F. Daniel, of Daniel &amp; Komarek, Chartered, Panama
City, for appellants. </tt></p>

<p><tt>Robert A. Butterworth, Atty. Gen., and Gypsy Bailey, Asst.
Atty. Gen., Tallahassee, for appellee. </tt></p>

<p><tt>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING </tt></p>

<p><tt>ERVIN, Judge. </tt></p>

<p><tt>We substitute the following opinion for Jenks v. State, 16
F.L.W. D1070, 1991 WL 61786 (Fla. 1st DCA Apr. 16, 1991). </tt></p>

<p><tt>Kenneth and Barbara Jenks appeal their convictions for
cultivation of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia,
contending that the trial court erred in refusing to recognize
their defense of medical necessity.&nbsp; We agree and reverse. </tt></p>

<p><tt>Kenneth Jenks inherited hemophilia from his mother, and
contracted the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus
from a blood transfusion in 1980.&nbsp; He unknowingly passed it
to his wife, Barbara Jenks.&nbsp; Mrs. Jenks' health began to
decline rapidly.&nbsp; Her weight dropped from 150 to 112 pounds
during a three week period as a result of constant vomiting, and
she was hospitalized at least six times for two to three weeks at
a time. Although she had been prescribed over a half-dozen oral
medications for nausea, none of them worked.&nbsp; When given
shots for nausea, she was left in a stupor and unable to
function.&nbsp; Like wise, when Mr. Jenks started AZT treatment,
he was not able to eat because the medication left him constantly
nauseous.&nbsp; He also lost weight, although not as dramatically
as his wife. </tt></p>

<p><tt>When the Jenks began participating in a support group
sponsored by the Bay County Health Department, a group member
told them how marijuana had helped him.&nbsp; Although initially
reluctant, Mr. and Mrs. Jenks tried marijuana and found that they
were able to retain their AIDS medications, eat, gain weight,
maintain their health, and stay out of the hospital.&nbsp; They
asked their treating physician about prescribing the drug, but
were unable to obtain a legal prescription.&nbsp; The Jenks
decided to grow two marijuana plants to insure its availability,
avoid the expense of buying it on the street, and reduce the
possibility of arrest. </tt></p>

<p><tt>On March 29, 1990, the Jenks were arrested and charged
with manufacturing (cultivating) cannabis, pursuant to Section
893.13, Florida Statutes (1989), and possession of drug
paraphernalia, a violation of Section 893.147, Florida Statutes
(1989).&nbsp; The Jenks admitted to cultivating the marijuana and
advised officers at the scene that they each had AIDS and used
the marijuana to relieve their symptoms. </tt></p>

<p><tt>The Jenks waived their right to a jury trial and agreed
that the bench trial should center on their defense of medical
necessity.&nbsp; Because their physician, Thomas Sunnenberg, was
not available to testify, the parties stipulated that Dr.
Sunnenberg's testimony would be, in part: </tt></p>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dd><tt>Defense witness, THOMAS D. SUNNENBERG, M.D. ...
            will testify as follows: </tt></dd>
        <dd><tt>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* </tt></dd>
        <dd><tt>8.&nbsp; That he has been unable to find any
            effective drug for treating the defendants' nausea. </tt></dd>
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>582 SOUTHERN REPORTER, 2d SERIES 678 </p>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dd><tt>9.&nbsp; That the nausea is so debilitating that
            if it is not controlled, the defendants could die. </tt></dd>
        <dd><tt>10.&nbsp; That if he could legally prescribe
            Cannabis Sativa as a drug to control their nausea he
            would. </tt></dd>
        <dd><tt>11.&nbsp; That the only drug that controls their
            nausea is Cannabis Sativa. </tt></dd>
        <dd><tt>12.&nbsp; That he is presently seeking access to
            legal Cannabis Sativa through the Food and Drug
            Administration under the Compassionate
            Investigational New Drug Program (IND) for the Jenks. </tt></dd>
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>At trial, the defense also presented two expert witnesses,
Robert Randall, who suffers from glaucoma and who successfully
asserted the defense of medical necessity against a charge of
marijuana cultivation in 1976,* and Dr. Daniel Dansak of Alabama,
who has treated over fifty patients who have used marijuana to
alleviate both disease symptoms and side-effects of medication. </tt></p>

<p><tt>The trial judge rejected the defense of medical necessity,
found the Jenks guilty of manufacturing marijuana, and withheld
adjudication of guilt, placing the Jenks on one year of
unsupervised probation. He ordered the Jenks to perform 500 hours
of community service, to be discharged only by &quot;providing
care, comfort and concern for each other.&quot; </tt></p>

<p><tt>The necessity defense has been formulated as follows: </tt></p>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dd><tt>The pressure of natural physical forces sometimes confronts
            a person in an emergency with a choice of two evils:
            either he may violate the literal terms of the criminal
            law and thus produce a harmful result, or he may
            comply with those terms and thus produce a greater or
            equal or lesser amount of harm.&nbsp; For reasons of social
            policy, if the harm which will result from compliance
            with the law is greater than that which will result
            from violation of it, he is by virtue of the defense
            of necessity justified in violating it. </tt></dd>
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>W.R. LaFave &amp; A.W. Scott, Jr., 1 Substantive Criminal
Law  5.4, at 627 (1986) (hereinafter LaFave &amp; Scott).&nbsp;
Or, as stated by Justice Holmes, &quot;'Detached reflection
cannot be expected in the presence of an uplifted knife.'&quot;&nbsp;
Arnolds &amp; Garland, The Defense of Necessity in Criminal Law: The
Right to Choose the Lesser Evil, 65 J.Crim.L. &amp; Criminology
289, 290 (1974) (hereinafter Arnolds &amp; Garland) (quoting
Brown v. United States, 256 U.S. 335, 41 S.Ct. 501, 65 L.Ed. 961
(1921)). </tt></p>

<p><tt>Although there is no specific legislative acceptance of
the necessity defense in Florida, we conclude that the defense
was recognized at common law and that there has been no clearly
expressed legislative rejection of such defense.&nbsp; The
necessity defense was articulated as early as 1551 in Reninger v.
Fagossa, 1 Plowd. 1, 19, 75 Eng.Rep. 1, 29-30 (1551): &quot;[W]here
the words of [the law] are broken to avoid greater inconvenience,
or through necessity, or by compulsion,&quot; the law has not
been broken.&nbsp; Arnolds &amp; Garland, at 291.&nbsp; The
authors state that the defense is poorly developed in
Anglo-American jurisprudence because there are so few cases dealing
with it, &quot;probably because these cases are not often prosecuted.&quot;&nbsp;
In any event, they indicate that although there is some disagreement
on this, &quot;it seems clear that necessity was a defense at common
law.&quot;&nbsp; Arnolds &amp; Garland, at 290.&nbsp; The authors
cite a number of pre-1776 cases involving the necessity
defense.&nbsp; Arnolds &amp; Garland, at 291 n. 29.* </tt></p>

<p><tt>Consequently, we consider that Florida has adopted the
necessity defense pursuant to Section 2.01, Florida Statutes
(1989), which provides: </tt></p>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dd><tt>The common and statute laws of England which are
            of a general and not a local nature ... are declared
            to be of force in this state; provided, the said
            statutes and common law be not inconsistent with the
            Constitution and laws of the United States and the
            acts of the Legislature of this state. </tt></dd>
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p>JENKS v. STATE Fla. 679 <br>
Cite as 582 So.2d 676 (Fla.App. 1 Dist. 1991) </p>

<p><tt>The medical-necessity defense is merely a more particular
application of the necessity defense, See, e.g., LaFave &amp;
Scott at  5.4(c)7, at 631-33; G.E. Torcia, 1 Wharton's Criminal
Law  88 (1978); 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law  50 (1989).&nbsp; In
fact, in Bavero v. State, 347 So.2d 781 (Fla. 1st DCA 1977), this
court recognized the defense of medical necessity there asserted
by a prison escapee.&nbsp; Accord State v. Alcantaro, 407 So.2d
922, 924 (Fla. 1st DCA 1981) (&quot;Medical necessity was
recognized as an arguable defense by this court in Bavero v.
State[.]&quot;), review denied, 413 So.2d 875 (Fla.1982). </tt></p>

<p><tt>[1]&nbsp; Although the state conceded at oral argument
that the necessity defense exists in Florida's common law, the
state nevertheless contends that Section 893.03, Florida Statutes
(1989), is inconsistent with and therefore precludes the defense
in the case at bar.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; Section 893.03(1)
provides: </tt></p>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dd><tt>SCHEDULE 1.&nbsp; A substance in Schedule I has a
            high potential for abuse and has no currently
            accepted medical use in treatment in the United
            States and in its use under medical supervision does
            not meet accepted safety standards except for such
            uses provided for in s. 402.36.&nbsp; The following
            substances are controlled in Schedule I: </tt></dd>
        <dd><tt>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* </tt></dd>
        <dd><tt>(c)4.&nbsp; Cannabis. </tt></dd>
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>(Footnote omitted.) However, subsection (1)(d) provides, </tt></p>

<blockquote>
    <dl>
        <dd><tt>Notwithstanding the aforementioned fact that
            Schedule I substances have no currently accepted
            medical use, the Legislature recognizes that certain
            substances are currently accepted for certain limited
            medical uses in treatment in the United States but
            have a high potential for abuse. </tt></dd>
    </dl>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>The state argues that section 893.03 permits no medical
uses of marijuana whatsoever.&nbsp; In fact, all that subsection
(1) states is that marijuana is not generally available for
medical use. Subsection (1)(d), however, clearly indicates that
Schedule I substances may be subject to limited medical
uses.&nbsp; It is well established that a statute should not be construed
as abrogating the common law unless it speaks unequivocally, and
should not be interpreted to displace common law more than is necessary.&nbsp;
Carlile v. Game &amp; Fresh Water Fish Comm'n, 354 So.2d 362, 364 (Fla.1977)
(quoting 30 Fla.Jur. Statutes  130 (rev. ed. 1974); State v. Egan,
287 So.2d 1, 6-7 (Fla.1973); Sullivan v. Leatherman, 48 So.2d
836, 838 (Fla.1950) (en banc).&nbsp; We conclude that section
893.03 does not preclude the defense of medical necessity under
the particular facts of this case. </tt></p>

<p><tt>[2, 3] Moreover, we conclude that the Jenks met their
burden of establishing this defense at trial.&nbsp; The elements
of the defense have previously been addressed by trial courts in
United States v. Randall, 104 Daily Wash.L.Rep. 2249
(Super.Ct.D.C. Nov. 24, 1976), and in Florida in State v.
Mussika, 14 F.L.W. 1 (Fla. 17th Cir.Ct. Dec. 28, 1988), which both
involved the medically necessary use of marijuana by people with glaucoma.&nbsp;
Those elements are as follows: 1. That the defendant did not intentionally
bring about the circumstance which precipitated the unlawful act;
2. That the defendant could not accomplish the same objective
using a less offensive alternative available to the defendant; and
3. That the evil sought to be avoided was more heinous than the unlawful
act perpetrated to avoid it. </tt></p>

<p><tt>As applied to the case at bar, the Jenks obviously did not
intend to contract AIDS. Furthermore, the Jenks' medical expert
and physician testified that no drug or treatment is available
that would effectively eliminate or diminish the Jenks' nausea.*
Finally, the Jenks established that if their nausea was not
controlled, their lives were </tt></p>

<p>582 SOUTHERN REPORTER, 2d SERIES 680 </p>

<p><tt>in danger.*&nbsp; The state put on no evidence that
contradicted the Jenks, and the trial court had no authority to
reject the witnesses' testimony.&nbsp; Based upon these facts, we
conclude the trial court erred in reject ing the Jenks' defense
and in convicting them as charged. </tt></p>

<p><tt>REVERSED with directions that judgment of acquittal be
entered. </tt></p>

you went for a couple of days without these?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">KEN JENKS:&nbsp; We'd throw up all the time. <spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mrs. JENKS:&nbsp; I
would get sick to my stomach.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. JENKS:&nbsp; I mean, you couldn't - you get sick, and then
you can't take your medicine, so<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mrs. JENKS:&nbsp; I wouldn't be able to eat.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. JENKS:&nbsp; - and then you can't eat, so, I mean, the weight
- and then you'd start losing weight, so, I mean -<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mrs. JENKS:&nbsp; Having AIDS is like a wasting syndrome, you
know, with the virus and everything.&nbsp; The smell of food, the
- just even thinking about food just makes you nauseated.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] Ken and Barbara Jenks are dying.&nbsp;
He is a hemophiliac.&nbsp; Eleven years ago, he was given blood
contaminated by the AIDS virus.&nbsp; He unknowingly infected his
wife.&nbsp; They are both too sick to work.&nbsp; They live on
disability, barely able to cope.&nbsp; Without the marijuana, they
would probably be dead, would have wasted away because of the
nausea brought on by their chemotherapy.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Before they got marijuana legally, they bought it on the street,
or grew it, until last year, when police burst into their trailer
in Panama City, Florida, and got the goods on them: two marijuana plants.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. JENKS:&nbsp; And then they started, you know, going through
my house, I mean, just dumping drawers and tearing the cabinets
up.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] The police thought they were onto
something big when they found a suitcase filled with syringes and
other drug paraphernalia.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. JENKS:&nbsp; I mean, they were going berserk.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] Ken tried to convince them that the
syringes and the pills were prescribed by doctors.&nbsp; He did
not tell them that marijuana was the only medicine that enabled them
to take the chemotherapy without being violently ill.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mrs. JENKS:&nbsp; You're talking to somebody that never wanted to
take an aspirin for a headache.&nbsp; It's - it's a relief to
know that there's something that you can smoke to relieve the nausea
from taking all the medications that you're on.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] The Jenks were charged with growing
marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia.&nbsp; In court,
their lawyer, John Daniel, tried to prove that for the Jenks,
marijuana was a medical necessity. <spacer type="horizontal" size="80">[interviewing] Did the
prosecution present any counterevidence?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">JOHN DANIEL:&nbsp; None whatsoever, sir.&nbsp; In fact, they even
stipulated in Kenny and Barbara's case that it was beneficial for
them and that they would die without it.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; The prosecution conceded that?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. DANIEL:&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; But you lost the case because you couldn't prove
medical necessity, so that doesn't jibe somehow.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. DANIEL:&nbsp; Judge Foster said there is no such doctrine as
medical necessity in Florida, that it's a matter for the
legislature to promulgate a statute that says that it is or is
not.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; But the judge was not an unsympathetic judge.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. DANIEL:&nbsp; Super judge.&nbsp; The sweetest sentence I've
had in 20 years of criminal defense work.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] The judge found them guilty, but
sentenced them to 500 hours of community service.&nbsp; Their
only task?&nbsp; To look after each other.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">As decent as the sentence was, the Jenks were outraged that they
were still considered criminals.&nbsp; They decided to appeal.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. DANIEL:&nbsp; Kenny and Barbara said, &quot;Go for it.&nbsp;
We're going to be gone soon.&nbsp; There's going to be people
following in our footprints and in our pain and suffering, and
there needs to be some law made one way or the other on
it.&quot;&nbsp; That's why they took it up on appeal, and I'm
glad to do it for them.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; They're not exactly the wealthiest
clients in the world.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. DANIEL:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I'm not exactly charging them, sir.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] The DEA classifies marijuana as a
highly dangerous drug, in the same class as heroin and LSD.&nbsp;
And the only way to get it legally is to face a bureaucratic
jungle, three of them.&nbsp; Applications have to go through the
DEA, the FDA and the National Institute of Drug Abuse, and if all
approve, the legal marijuana, grown on a government farm in
Mississippi, is sent to the patient's pharmacist, a month's supply
of cigarettes at a time.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Robert Randall was the first American to gain legal access to
marijuana for medical use.&nbsp; He was diagnosed with glaucoma
in 1972. Doctors told him he had three to five years before he would
go blind. One evening, he tried a marijuana cigarette.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">ROBERT RANDALL:&nbsp; It was a bit like a &quot;Eureka!&quot;
experience.&nbsp; I mean, I had known in college that if I smoked
marijuana, what the doctors then called &quot;eyestrain&quot;
seemed to diminish, but I had never put all the pieces together,
and suddenly they came together.&nbsp; The next morning I woke up and
thought that I was crazy.&nbsp; It's crazy to believe that an
illegal drug is going to prolong your sight, when all the modern
pharmaceuticals have failed to do so.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] Randall is still on prescription drugs,
but his doctors found that the essential drug in relieving the
intense eye pressure of glaucoma was marijuana, which he's been smoking
for 15 years. But getting it legally was not easy.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. RANDALL:&nbsp; It took 14 months from the time of my
arrest.&nbsp; I had to go through -<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; You were arrested for possession?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. RANDALL:&nbsp; I was arrested for growing four marijuana
plants.&nbsp; I had to go through two controlled medical studies
that were really unnecessary.&nbsp; They simply demonstrated to
others what I already knew to be the case.&nbsp; And then I had
to wait around for many months while a bunch of bureaucrats, who
were really not very excited about this idea, decided whether or
not I would go blind.&nbsp; It's a very uncomfortable,
frightening situation to be in.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] Only 14 people are now able to get
marijuana legally from the government.&nbsp; It took the Jenks
almost nine months to get their first prescription.&nbsp; Many
doctors are reluctant to make the effort, fearing that the
ramifications of even applying for marijuana will affect their
reputations.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="80">[interviewing] The Jenks' own doctor, who prescribes marijuana
for them, won't come on and talk about it.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. DANIEL:&nbsp; A junkie doctor.&nbsp; He doesn't want to be
called that.&nbsp; I understand that.&nbsp; He could - it could
also be, &quot;I'm afraid I'll have all of these people coming
out of the woodwork saying, 'Oh, I've got a back pain, Doctor,
how about giving me 400 joints?'&quot;&nbsp; I can understand
that.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] But many doctors say their reluctance
to apply for a prescription has nothing to do with
bureaucracy.&nbsp; Dr. Richard Gralla, who heads the Department
of Oncology at the Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans, told us that
the scientific studies do not show marijuana as effective as
other drugs, despite the claims of Randall and other patients.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. RICHARD GRALLA:&nbsp; There are testimonials for almost any
medicine, and in fact, sometimes testimonials are the germ of a
good idea, the beginning of a good idea.&nbsp; Unfortunately, more
often than not, they're just that, they're just testimonials.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] But Dr. Lester Grinspoon, who practices
psychiatry at Harvard University, disagrees.&nbsp; He's one of
the first physicians to take a stand on using marijuana as
medical treatment.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. LESTER GRINSPOON:&nbsp; It is very useful for the treatment
of the nausea and vomiting which accompanies the use of some
chemotherapeutic substances for the treatment of some cancers.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] Dr. Grinspoon knows it from the most
personal kind of experience.&nbsp; His son had leukemia and died,
but during the chemothernpy Grinspoon feels it was the marijuana
that was keeping young Danny alive.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. GRINSPOON:&nbsp; He would be so tense before he took the
medicine, because he knew what was going to follow, and what
followed was eight hours of first vomiting, and then
retching.&nbsp; It's very, very, difficult.&nbsp; He got to the
point where he said, &quot;I'm not going to take the medicine anymore.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; How old was he?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. GRINSPOON:&nbsp; He was 15.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] His wife bought some marijuana near a
local high school.&nbsp; At Danny's next treatment, Grinspoon was
amazed.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. GRINSPOON:&nbsp; It was absolutely stunning, the difference
that this made.&nbsp; He was relaxed, he had the treatment, he
not only did not have nausea and vomiting, but he asked if he
could get a submarine sandwich on the way home.&nbsp; I was
really dumbfounded.&nbsp; I then called the doctor, Dr. Jaffe,
who was taking care of him, and told him what had happened, and
so the next time he smoked cannabis right in the treatment room
at the Children's Hospital.&nbsp; Same thing, not a bit of discomfort,
ate afterwards, and it was then that Dr. Jaffe and I went to the
head of the Children's Hospital, Dr. Frye, and suggested that
maybe this bore some kind of systematic looking into.&nbsp; And that,
in fact, led to the Salan study, which first established that
this is useful in the treatment of the nausea and vomiting of
cancer chemotherapy.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; But the DEA has maintained for years that marijuana
has no therapeutic value, that it's a dangerous drug that must
remain illegal.&nbsp; However, no one from the DEA would come on
this broadcast and respond to the scientific evidence of those
who say otherwise.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Three years ago, the DEA's administrative law judge, Francis
Young, wrote of marijuana, &quot;In light of the evidence, it
would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to
stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this
substance.&quot;&nbsp; But the DEA rejected its own judge's opinion
and stands firm that doctors shall not prescribe marijuana.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">[voice-over] Except, of course, for those few who are willing to
go through the agonizingly long process of applying.&nbsp;
Desperate patients say they would rather live by buying marijuana
illegally than die by playing by the rules.&nbsp; Dr. Ivan
Silverberg hears that all the time from his cancer patients in
San Francisco.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. IVAN SILVERBERG:&nbsp; I have yet to hear of a patient who
can't find it.&nbsp; I have heard loud and clear from patients
who resent having to go on the street when they're feeling sick,
when they're nauseated, when they've lost 40 and 50, 60 pounds,
to try and buy a drug from somebody without knowing whether that
drug is adulterated because it comes off the street, of having to
face the possibility that the person they're buying it from is an
undercover policeman.&nbsp; I think all these things are wrong.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] But Silverberg says if he had to fill
out that mountain of paperwork every time a patient needed
marijuana, he wouldn't have time to treat his patients.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="80">[interviewing] Why has the DEA dug its heels in on this and will
not allow the general prescribing of marijuana by physicians when
you can prescribe much more dangerous, much more habit-forming
drugs?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. SILVERBERG:&nbsp; You're absolutely correct.&nbsp; I think
morphine, for example, Demerol, are far more hazardous drugs, in
my opinion, than marijuana.&nbsp; I think part of it is an
entrenched bureaucracy that doesn't want to admit it's wrong.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. GRALLA:&nbsp; Even if it were available in 10 minutes down in
the pharmacy, I'd be reluctant to write it.&nbsp; It has nothing
to do with it - the political issues that we have in drugs and
the drug problem in the United States.&nbsp; It's the fact that
in my own experience in using cannabinoids - in my patients' experience,
who have smoked marijuana, neither marijuana nor the cannabinoids
measure up to those drugs that I have.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] Among those drugs is Zofran, which has
been on the market only for the past few months.&nbsp; By all
accounts, it works wonderfully.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. SILVERBERG:&nbsp; Zofran is a most effective drug which is
said to have an 80 percent response rate, by their
definition.&nbsp; It costs $600 a day.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; And the patient has to have it administered in the
hospital?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. SILVERBERG:&nbsp; Or in a full - in an ambulatory care center
where he's there, essentially, the whole day.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] If marijuana is as effective as Doctors
Silverberg and Grinspoon say it is, why haven't the drug
companies tried to get government approval for it?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. GRINSPOON:&nbsp; You can't patent marijuana, it's a
plant.&nbsp; They can't make any money.&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; You
see, in our country, the way drugs come into being, a drug
company gets hold of a chemical, somebody discovered it has some
sort of effect, they review it, they decide is it worth trying to
do it.&nbsp; They have to invest between $80 and $100 million to
get it from chemical to drug on the shelf.&nbsp; But then they
get an exclusive patent for 17 years, and they can earn a lot of
money.&nbsp; How could they possibly do this with cannabis?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; [voice-over] For the Jenks, marijuana has made their
troubled lives tolerable, and to the doubters they say -<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mrs. JENKS:&nbsp; Do I look like a junkie?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. JENKS:&nbsp; Do I? I mean -<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mrs. JENKS:&nbsp; I wish I didn't have to take the medication
that I - I wish I didn't even have to smoke marijuana.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. JENKS:&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; It'd be nice to be to be free of
drugs and disease, but we're not.&nbsp; I mean, we need
drugs.&nbsp; I can't help that.&nbsp; I mean, I've been taking
drugs my whole life, and it hasn't made a junkie out of me.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; Do you ever agonize over, &quot;Why me?&nbsp; Why
us?&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. JENKS:&nbsp; At first.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mrs. JENKS:&nbsp; At first we did.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. JENKS:&nbsp; But then, I mean, for me it was easier.&nbsp; I
mean, I've been dealing with disease since I was six months old,
so it was just like fuel to the fire.&nbsp; I mean, you know, it
was just one more thing.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mrs. JENKS:&nbsp; He blamed himself because I had gotten it, and
I don't blame him, because he - you know, I love him, he's my
husband.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Mr. JENKS:&nbsp; You know, these are the cards you got
dealt.&nbsp; You've just got to play 'em or fold, kind of.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">SAFER:&nbsp; The Jenks eventually won their appeal and their
criminal convictions were overturned.&nbsp; The Public Health
Service is not accepting any new applications into the program
for marijuana prescriptions and it's considering closing it down
entirely, regardless of what patients say.</tt></p>

<p align="center"><tt>DECLARATION OF DANIEL A. SPYKER, Ph.D.,
M.D.</tt></p>

<p><tt>I, Dr. Daniel A. Spyker, do hereby declare the following:</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>1.&nbsp; I am a Medical Officer in the Pilot Drug
Evaluation Staff, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&nbsp; I have held this
position since August 1990.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>2.&nbsp; In my position as Medical Officer, I am engaged
fulltime in the evaluation of clinical drug trials, proposed and
completed, in support of investigational new drug applications
(INDs) and new drug applications submitted to the FDA under the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).&nbsp; Since
October 1990, I have been responsible for the review and follow-up
of INDs relating to marijuana, including a number of single-patient
INDs from physicians requesting therapeutic marijuana for their
patients.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>3.&nbsp; A single-patient IND for marijuana, an unapproved
new drug under the Act, allows a physician to receive and
dispense the drug as an investigational drug for use in one
specific patient.&nbsp; Because marijuana is not a drug approved
by the FDA, distribution of marijuana outside the IND process is
in violation of the Act.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>4.&nbsp; While FDA processes and allows single-patient
INDs for investigational drugs to proceed, FDA does not supply
the drugs.&nbsp; In the case of single-patient INDs for
marijuana, the marijuana is provided by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human
Services, pursuant to its authority under the Public Health
Service Act.&nbsp; Before the National Institute on Drug Abuse
can supply marijuana to the sponsoring physician for a
single-patient IND, because the drug is regulated under the
Controlled Substances Act, the physician must apply to and
receive approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the
Department of Justice, to receive and dispense the marijuana.&nbsp;
When the Drug Enforcement Administration issues a registration
for the physician to receive the marijuana, it provides the order
form which must be presented to the National Institute on Drug Abuse
for shipment of the marijuana.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>5.&nbsp; When a single-patient IND for marijuana is
received by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, it is
forwarded to the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff for review.&nbsp;
The IND is assigned to a consumer safety officer who distributes
copies to the reviewing chemist, pharmacologist, and medical
officer.&nbsp; These reviewers decide whether it is safe for the study
proposed in the IND to proceed.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>6.&nbsp; The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
received a single-patient IND for marijuana for Ladd Huffman on
January 2, 1991.&nbsp; The IND was submitted by Patricia J.
Harrison, M.D.&nbsp; The IND was received by the Pilot Drug
Evaluation Staff on January 7, 1991.&nbsp; The consumer safety
officer distributed the IND to the reviewers.&nbsp; The
pharmacology review was completed on January 10, 1991, and it
determined that it was safe for the IND to proceed.&nbsp; The
chemistry review was completed on January 11, 1991, and it
determined that it was safe for the IND to proceed.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>7.&nbsp; I called the sponsoring physician, Dr. Harrison,
on January 11, 1991, to discuss the requirements for the IND and
to request the submission of additional information.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>8.&nbsp; I completed the medical review of the IND for
Ladd Huffman on January 16, 1991, and determined that it was safe
for the IND to proceed.&nbsp; On January 25, 1991, I received the
information I had requested from Dr. Harrison.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>9.&nbsp; On March 8, 1991, I issued a letter to Dr.
Harrison advising her that the IND for Ladd Huffman could
proceed.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>10.&nbsp; In June 1991, the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff
was advised that the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department
of Health and Human Services, had decided to consider whether the
National Institute on Drug Abuse would continue to supply
marijuana for single-patient INDs.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>11.&nbsp; In March 1992, the Pilot Drug Evaluation Staff
was advised that the Secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services had made a decision that the National Institute on
Drug Abuse would not provide marijuana for single-patient INDs
except to those patients who were receiving marijuana at the
time.&nbsp; This group receiving marijuana included patients
whose INDs FDA has already reviewed and allowed to proceed, whose
physicians had received approval to receive the marijuana from
the Drug Enforcement Administration and for whom the National
Institute on Drug Abuse had shipped marijuana upon receipt of the
Drug Enforcement Administration order form submitted by the
physicians.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>12.&nbsp; As I understand it, the March 1992 decision of
the Secretary of Health and Human Services not to provide
marijuana to additional single patient INDs was based on a number
of considerations including the health concerns of providing
patients with potentially harmful substances, and the fact that
existing medical evidence does not support additional research on
smoked marijuana to treat disease in single patient
studies.&nbsp; For those patients who had already received
marijuana, marijuana would continue to be supplied while their
physicians, with assistance from the Department of Health and
Human Services, explored alternative therapies.&nbsp; Through
attrition among this patient group, the Department of Health and Human
Services would eventually achieve its ultimate goal of not supplying
marijuana for any patients under single-patient INDs.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>13.&nbsp; As I understand from the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, shipments began in August 1991 for the last person to
receive marijuana under a single-patient IND.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>14.&nbsp; As I understand from the Drug Enforcement
Administration, that agency received an application from Dr.
Harrison to receive and dispense marijuana for Ladd Huffman on
August 19, 1991, but no registration to receive marijuana was
issued.&nbsp; Since Dr. Harrison had not received approval to
receive and dispense marijuana for Ladd Huffman from the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse had not shipped
any marijuana for Ladd Huffman.&nbsp; Therefore, under the March
1992 decision of the Secretary, the National Institute on Drug
Abuse would not supply marijuana for Ladd Huffman's
single-patient IND.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>15.&nbsp; There were 27 additional single-patient INDs
that FDA had allowed to proceed which had not received
marijuana.&nbsp; Under the Secretary's March 1992 decision,
marijuana would not be supplied for these INDs by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>16.&nbsp; In March 1992, as a result of the Secretary's
decision, I contacted the sponsoring physicians of the INDs for
Ladd Huffman and other patients who were not already receiving
marijuana to advise them that the National Institute on Drug
Abuse would not supply marijuana for their single-patient
INDs.&nbsp; I also advised the sponsoring physicians of other
treatment options for their patients' conditions and the availability
of referrals to experts at the National Institutes of Health,
Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human
Services.&nbsp; The single-patient INDs for these individuals
were cancelled.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>17.&nbsp; FDA cannot disclose information regarding
patients receiving marijuana under single-patient INDs without
such patients' consent.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1746, I declare under penalty of
perjury that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the
foregoing is true and correct.</tt></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><tt>Executed on: June 16, 1993, at Rockville, MD.</tt></p>

<pre> 
POT'S TAB IN THE  
WAR ON DRUGS  
</pre>

<pre> 
The investment:  
     * Federal matching funds for the &quot;war on drugs&quot; in Arkansas totaled 
$4.6 million in 1992. 
     * State and local agencies kicked in another $1.8 million. 
     * The Arkansas National Guard received $1.3 million to assist in 
marijuana eradication. 
     * An unknown additional amount of money was generated for drug 
investigations by the sale of confiscated property. 
     * No figures are available for the cost of prosecuting drug cases 
and incarcerating offenders.   
</pre>

<pre> 
The return:  
     * 42 percent of all arrests for the sale and manufacture of drugs in 
1992 were for selling or growing marijuana. 
     * And 62 percent of all arrests for possession of drugs were for 
possession of marijuana.

By Mara Leveritt  
     The monkeys smoked a joint a day.  
     Actually, they didn't recline in their cages, puffing a hand-rolled 
reefer.  This being a scientific experiment, funded by the powerful 
National Institute on Drug Abuse, the process was more carefully 
controlled.  The monkeys were fitted with masks through which marijuana 
smoke, machine-puffed in carefully measured doses, was passed into their 
nostrils. 
     The experiment, performed at the National Center for Toxicological 
Research near Pine Bluff, was designed to test whether chronic marijuana 
use caused brain damage.  It lasted for several years, with the most 
intensive phase, during which monkeys were exposed to heavy doses of 
marijuana smoke, occurring from 1984 to 1985. 
     Reports on the study's findings continue to be published in 
pharmacology and toxicology journals.  But beyond those tight scientific 
circles, the results of the NCTR experiment, the most extensive of its 
kind yet conducted, have gone almost entirely unnoticed. 
     That's not surprising, perhaps.  In a world where the political 
majority has shown little tolerance for marijuana, the test results are 
explosive. 
     The experiment discovered no adverse impact from marijuana on 
monkeys' general health, no sign that heavy exposure to marijuana smoke 
caused lung cancer, and, with one exception, no long-term effects on the 
animals' behavior from exposure to marijuana. 
     Before the NCTR study, the largest experiment examining the effects 
of marijuana on primates was one conducted at the Stanford Research 
Institute.  That experiment, focusing on the brain's electrical activity 
under the influence of marijuana, involved 16 monkeys. 
     By contrast, the experiment at NCTR used 62 monkeys, all rhesus 
males.  In 1983, the animals were all approximately two to three years 
old, the monkey equivalent of teen-agers. 
     For one year before the start of the experiment, the monkeys were 
trained to play &quot;games&quot; designed to test their perception of the passage 
of time and their ability to discern left from right.  Only after they 
were proficient did the exposure to marijuana begin. 
     Toxicologists divided the monkeys into four groups.  Every day for a 
year, 16 monkeys each received what Dr. Merle Paule, head of NCTR's 
Behavioral Toxicology Laboratory and Primate Research Facility, called &quot;a 
pretty heavy exposure&quot; to marijuana, the human equivalent, Paule said, of 
&quot;four or five joints a day.&quot; 
     Another group of 16 smoked the same amount of marijuana, but only 
two days per week.  Staffers called them the &quot;weekend smokers.&quot; 
     A third group was administered smoke from cigarettes identical to 
the others, except that the psychoactive component of THC had been 
removed.  And a fourth group received no smoke exposure at all. 
     The monkeys smoked for a year, then they were monitored and tested 
for another year. 
     Dr. William Slikker, acting director of NCTR's Division of 
Neurotoxicology, explained that the study generated so much data, it has 
taken time to compile it and the results have been released gradually, in 
several reports since the experiment was ended. 
     In 1991, the journal Fundamental and Applied Toxicology published a 
report on the effects of marijuana on the monkeys' general health.  
Slikker was the lead writer, with Paule (pronounced Paul) and other NCTR 
researchers listed as collaborators. 
     That report concluded, &quot;The general health of the monkeys was not 
compromised by a year of marijuana smoke exposure as indicated by weight 
gain, carboxyhemoglobin and clinical chemistry/hematology values. 
     &quot;Most clinical parameters ... did not show any treatment-related 
changes, and those few that did were of small magnitude, transient in 
nature, and were not different at the end of the five-month postdosing 
period.&quot; 
     Last week, in his office at NCTR, Paule explained the health study's 
results in more casual terms.  &quot;There's just nothing there,&quot; he said.  
&quot;They were all fine.&quot; 
     Last year, the journal Toxicology Letters published a report by 
another group of NCTR researchers on the effects of marijuana on the 
lungs of the monkeys who smoked.  Seven months after the last exposure to 
marijuana smoke, some of the monkeys were killed and their bodies 
autopsied.  Scientists examined the lungs for signs of disturbances 
called &quot;carcinogen-DNA adducts,&quot; considered to be one of the early 
indications of cancer. 
     The writers of that study reported that although their findings were 
not conclusive, they were &quot;at variance with earlier work suggesting that 
fractions of marijuana smoke are highly genotoxic.&quot; 
     The seven authors noted that, &quot;It has been suggested that marijuana 
smoking is a proximal cause of respiratory cancer.  However, these 
intimations have not been borne out by epidemiological investigations, 
which is surprising considering the widespread use of marijuana.&quot; 
     Moreover, the journal article noted: &quot;The data presented here 
suggest that seven months after the last smoke exposure, there is not 
evidence of increased marijuana smoke-induced carcinogen-DNA adducts in 
the lungs of exposed monkeys.&quot; 
     Paule's informal interpretation: &quot;If it's not there, it's probably 
not too terrible.&quot; 
     (The researchers discount the claim that as marijuana has become 
increasingly potent, due to refined horticultural techniques, it has also 
become more dangerous.  Other studies, they say, have demonstrated that 
smokers inhale only to the point of inebriation, so that persons smoking 
stronger marijuana smoke considerably less of it.) 
     Late last year, Paule himself was the lead author of a report 
published in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.  
It dealt with marijuana's effect on behavior. 
     This report's findings were more complex.  
     Before the monkeys were started on their year-long smoke exposure, 
Slikker, Paule and other scientists, conducted a short-term study to 
determine the immediate effect of THC on the animals; in other words, how 
they reacted when they were &quot;high.&quot; 
     They found two areas of apparent impact.  One was the monkey's 
short-term memory.  &quot;That's a function that's very sensitive,&quot; Paule 
explained, &quot;but only on an acute basis.  If you test them the next day, 
you see no residual effect on those behaviors.&quot; 
     The monkeys sense of time also appeared disrupted.  Monkeys, it 
turns out, are as good as humans at estimating the passage of time.  
Members of both species to equally well at a test that requires them, for 
instance, to press down on a lever for more than 10 seconds but not 
longer than 14 seconds. 
     Marijuana has been shown to affect human's ability to perform the 
test at normal levels, and the monkeys were no different.  &quot;That time-
estimation behavior is exquisitely sensitive to marijuana,&quot; Paule said, 
&quot;even at very low doses.&quot; 
     The NCTR study corroborated human studies showing that time seems to 
stretch out for many subjects under the influence of marijuana.  In the 
monkeys' response to the time-perception test, Paule explained, &quot;what 
they said was that eight seconds feels like ten.&quot; 
     That phenomenon too, however, quickly dissipated.  Testing the next 
day showed the monkeys' time perception restored to its normal acuity. 
     The main thrust of the study, however, concerned the long-term 
effects of exposure to marijuana.  To study that, the animals were tested 
for cognitive function and motivation 23 hours after each marijuana 
exposure. 
     The cognitive test involved four lights and two levers.  The monkeys 
were taught that when they saw a red or a yellow light, they were to hit 
a lever on their left in order to receive a food pellet.  If a blue or a 
green light came on, they would get the pellet by hitting a lever on 
their right. 
     The researchers wanted to see if the animals scored any differently 
23 hours after exposure to marijuana than they had before receiving the 
drug.  &quot;On that test,&quot; Paule said, &quot;their performance was unaffected.&quot; 
     The test of motivation, however, showed a definite pattern of 
change.  This test required the monkeys to put forth an increasing amount 
of effort to get food.  Since a decrease in motivation or &quot;work ethic&quot; 
has been described as one of the effects of smoking marijuana, the 
researchers wanted to see &quot;how much effort the monkeys were willing to 
put out,&quot; as compared to the nonsmoking control group. 
     Their paychecks were banana-flavored food pellets.  For the first 
pellet, the monkeys had only to depress a lever once.  They had to hit it 
twice to get the second pellet.  And for a third pellet, they had to pump 
the lever three times. 
     Here, the group exposed to THC showed a clear unwillingness to get 
worked up about work.  Paule pointed out that during the year the test 
was being conducted, the monkeys were passing from adolescence into 
adulthood, a time for them, as for humans, he said, when &quot;the work ethic 
normally goes way up.&quot; 
     But that improvement didn't show up in the marijuana-smokers.  While 
the nonsmoking monkeys showed a willingness to work harder and harder as 
the year progressed, the marijuana groups stayed at adolescent levels. 
     &quot;Our interpretation of this is that marijuana smoking in monkeys 
does produce something akin to an amotivational syndrome,&quot; Paule said.  
He added, however, that the phenomenon may have occurred precisely 
because the monkeys were at the critical and deliberately chosen stage of 
adolescence when the NCTR test was conducted. 
     Because marijuana use is high among teenagers, depressed motivation 
at that stage in life can have serious effects.  But marijuana may not 
have the same effect on adults. 
     &quot;We did a search of the literature,&quot; Paule said, &quot;and we found that 
those studies that tried to find amotivational syndrome in adults could 
not find one.  It only appears in adolescence.  Chances are, if we'd done 
these studies in adults, we wouldn't have seen this effect.  And the good 
news is that, even among adolescents, when the exposure to marijuana was 
stopped, their motivation jumped right back up to normal levels.&quot; 
     &quot;It took two to three months for them to recover to full values, but 
they did recover and they recovered fully.&quot; 
     Paule noted two other findings related to the motivational test.  
One was that the willingness to work appeared to be equally affected in 
both the daily and weekend smokers.  &quot;That totally surprised us,&quot; he 
said. 
     Another finding worthy of note was that, as in most areas of life, 
one monkey proved to be an exception.  As Paule put it, he seemed to go 
&quot;blooey&quot; under the influence of marijuana. 
     &quot;Unlike the others, we found that this one particular animal was 
severely disrupted by chronic marijuana exposure on the discrimination 
task.  And he never recovered full from the amotivational syndrome.  We 
have no understanding of why.  Everything else about him tested normal.&quot; 
     That one monkey represents a warning.  As Paule cautioned, &quot;There 
appears to be tremendous individual variation in susceptibility to 
marijuana.&quot; 
     Also of interest in the NCTR study, in light of U.S. criminal 
sanctions against marijuana, is the researchers' observation that the 
animals exposed to marijuana never posed a threat to their handlers. 
     &quot;I've never seen anything that suggests marijuana is responsible for 
an increase in any violent behavior,&quot; Paule said, adding, &quot;I would say 
that the perceived risk to marijuana is probably overstated.&quot; 
     That's the scientist speaking.  Here's the father.  Asked what he 
would tell his 9-year-old son about the risks of smoking marijuana, this 
was Paule's answer: &quot;I'd tell him he probably shouldn't smoke dope before 
he becomes an adult.&quot;

POT RESEARCH LID ABOUT TO BLOW OPEN 
     Dr. Don McMillan, chairman of the Department of Pharmacology at the 
University of Arkansas at Little Rock, is also the school's Wilbur D. 
Mills professor of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Prevention.  He led a major 
study into human tolerance of marijuana in the early part of his career, 
and more recently served as an advisor to the researchers at NCTR in 
planning of their study of marijuana's effects on monkeys. 
     After years during which he said marijuana research was &quot;stalled,&quot; 
McMillan is once again excited about developments in the field. 
     &quot;It looks like the whole lid on marijuana research is about to blow 
wide open,&quot; he said in a recent interview.  &quot;I think we're going to know 
a tremendous amount more about the mechanism of action and how it works 
on the brain in the next two years.&quot; 
     As marijuana is studied further, its effects, especially relative to 
other, legal drugs, will also become better understood.  For example, 
marijuana is ranked with heroin and LSD as a Schedule I drug.  The 
federal government rates its potential for abuse higher than the risk of 
abusing cocaine, morphine, PCP, or methadone. 
     Asked about that, McMillan said, &quot;The thing you have to remember is 
that that schedule is a legal classification, not a medical one.&quot; 
     He said the medical understanding of marijuana is that it poses a 
lower risk to society and individual health than that of two legal drugs 
-- alcohol and tobacco. 
     &quot;Marijuana is probably less harmful than either of those -- but of 
course, there's still a lot we don't know about it.&quot;

<p align="center"><u>QUESTIONS PRESENTED FOR REVIEW</u></p>

<p>The circumstances of this case involve the bona fide medical
use of a controlled substance for a life threatening medical
necessity (deadly seizures), which was justified under section
503 of the Crimes Code, and which justification should be a
complete defense to all other sanctions. The suspension of the
Defendant's Driver's License in the instant case is the Political
Subjugation of Medicine, which is an issue of immediate public
importance, justifying this Honorable Court's assumption of
plenary jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The three main questions presented for review by this
Honorable Court are questions of substance not heretofore
determined by this Honorable Court. There are two other questions
which this Court has &quot;apparently ruled upon&quot; but which
are included in the proposed PETITION FOR CERTIORARI contained in
the Appendix of this pleading. The two other questions are
subsidiary questions fairly comprised within the three main
questions and shall not be discussed in this pleading. However,
argument on the two other questions, as set forth in paragraphs
one and two of the aforementioned CERTIORARI, is hereby reserved
for subsequent pleadings and oral argument. The three main
questions are as follows:</p>

<p>A. Whether the commonwealth can suspend the driver's license
of Defendant, who is a bona tide medical user of a controlled
substance, for a plea bargain to a crime which had nothing to do
with the Motor Vehicle Code.</p>

<p>B. Whether the Commonwealth can refuse to consider the
issuance of an occupational Limited License to the Defendant.</p>

<p>C. Whether the Defendant was denied his constitutional right
to Procedural Due Process by being required to present his entire
case to the lower court in five minutes.</p>

<p align="center">2 </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><u>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</u></p>

<p>This case involves the bona fide medical use of a controlled
substance for a life threatening medical necessity. After having
bloody nocturnal Epileptic seizures for almost five years, the
PETITIONER (Defendant) began using the only substance that could
stop his seizures, Cannabis. Defendant was treated with Dilantin
and other drugs by three Neurologists for 4 1/2 years, but the
conventional drugs prescribed by the Physicians did not stop the
Defendant's bloody nocturnal episodes.</p>

<p>In 1986, Defendant read in the medical literature that
Cannabis (&quot;Marijuana&quot; in Spanish) was known to be the
only substance to actually &quot;stop&quot; Epileptic seizures.
Defendant was in fear of death from his nocturnal Epileptic
seizures for two reasons. The first was the possibility of ending
a seizure &quot;on his back&quot; and thereby suffocating on the
&quot;swallowing of the tongue&quot; effect. But he was also
fearing death from &quot;drowning on his own blood.&quot; On many
a morning, Defendant woke up with blood all over his pillow and
sheets. His tongue was severely bitten into on both sides and the taste
of blood would last for days. Sometimes it would take weeks for
the tongue to heal and the pain resulting from the back spasms
during the seizures would last for months.</p>

<p>Because Defendant had no other legal alternative, he began
using Cannabis for his life threatening medical necessity in
1986. His actions were and continue to be justified under the
criteria set forth in section 503 of the Crimes Code. Defendant
has had no seizures for nine years and his termination of the use
of the controlled substance is not Medically indicated.</p>

<p>In 1988, at the St. Louis University Medical School, and in
1989, at the National Institute of Mental Health, cannabinoid
receptors were discovered and located in the human brain. This
new evidence gave the answer as to why Cannabis was so effective</p>

<p align="center">3 </p>

<hr>

<p>in the treatment of Epilepsy. We already knew why the miracle
drug cannabis was effective in Glaucoma, AIDS, Cancer, Asthma and
other diseases, but the existence and location of the brain receptors
now explained it's tremendous effectiveness in Epilepsy,
Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and other spastic
disorders. It seemed that the law should recognize these new
medical developments, but it did not. Instead, politicians caused
the POLITICAL SUBJUGATION OF MEDICINE.</p>

<p>In 1989, with George Bush playing &quot;tough on crime,&quot;
the &quot;Federal Mandates&quot; came in like gangbusters. The
mandates required the States to pass these new laws in order to
get the new &quot;Federal Money.&quot; The two statutes at issue
in the instant case are the results of the &quot;Federal Mandates.&quot;
No one paid any attention to the needs of the Medical Necessity
Users.</p>

<p>In March of 1992, Defendant plead guilty to the possession of
1/3 ounce of cannabis in return for &quot;one year probation and
no other penalty.&quot; Defendant never knew or was told of the
mandatory driver's license suspension during the court Colloquy.
When the Bureau of Motor Vehicles tried to suspend Defendant's
Driver's license in April of 1992, Defendant filed a Statutory
Appeal in the Allegheny County Common Pleas Court.</p>

<p>On November 4, 1992, the lower court dismissed Defendant's
Appeal and Defendant filed a timely appeal to the commonwealth
court. (The lower court order is attached hereto as &quot;Exhibit III.&quot;)
Oral Argument was not granted by the commonwealth Court and a
written &quot;OPINION NOT REPORTED MEMORANDUM OPINION&quot; was
filed by the commonwealth court on October 28, 1994. (Exhibit
II.) After consideration of a Petition for Reconsideration, the
Commonwealth Court denied same on January 10, 1995.</p>

<p>A timely Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal was filed
and is presently at issue before this Honorable Court.</p>

<p align="center">4 </p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><u>REASONS FOR ALLOWANCE OF APPEAL</u></p>

<p>This may be the most important case this Honorable Supreme
Court has ever considered, because it deals with the Political
Subjugation of Medicine. This recently identified PSM phenomenon
has caused an increase in the crime problem, the drug problem and
the domestic violence/abuse problems in the last seven years. In
essence, an overwhelming issue of immediate public importance is
at hand: This Honorable Court is obligated to be a non-political
entity, and it must therefore consider and rule upon this PSM
which has invaded the Legislative and Executive branches of
Government. If the Judiciary does not do it's duty, then we lose
our only hope for a decent Government: The Statutes at issue in
the instant case were passed without the slightest regard for the
then current medical information, a prime example of the
Political Subjugation of Medicine. All three main questions
presented for review in the instant case are ramifications of
this PSM and are questions of substance not heretofore determined
by this Honorable Court.</p>

<p>The Petitioner is a member of a &quot;suspect class&quot; of
Medical Necessity users of the Controlled substance Cannabis, who
deserve &quot;greater protection&quot; than other offenders,
because their actions are Justified under section 503 of the
Crimes Code. This &quot;suspect class&quot; involves millions of
people in this commonwealth who use Cannabis daily for Epilepsy,
Glaucoma, AIDS, Cancer, Asthma, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple
Sclerosis, Emphysema, Muscular Dystrophy and other diseases, and who's
driver's licenses are put in jeopardy by their medical
necessities.</p>

<p>WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays to this Honorable
Court for Allocatur, Permission for Appeal and for oral argument.</p>

<p>Respectfully Submitted, by: John M. Grubor, pro se, PETITIONER</p>

<p align="center">5 </p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Proposed Pleading&quot; (not to form):</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</u></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><u>PETITI0N FOR CERTIORARI</u></b></p>

<p>Questions to be presented to the Court:</p>

<p>1. Whether a State may rule that a sanction passed under a
&quot;Crimes Code&quot; is merely a &quot;civil penalty.&quot;
(thereby denying the consideration of constitutional rights
applicability to the sanction).</p>

<p>2. Whether a State may deny Due Process to a Defendant who has
executed a plea bargain by later demanding additional penalties
(license suspension and over $10,000 in costs) which were not disclosed
to the Defendant at the time of the Court colloquy. (Defendant
would not have plead guilty if he had known of the driver's
license suspension)</p>

<p>3. Whether a Defendant in a Driver's license suspension case
is denied Procedural Due Process by being required to present his
entire defense in five minutes in a courtroom that was a
&quot;joke&quot; because of apparent case fixing by the tipstaff.</p>

<p>4. Whether a State may take away ones liberty (driver's
license suspension) because of a Defendant's use (justified under
503 of crimes code) of a controlled substance which had nothing to
do with an automobile or the Motor vehicle Code.</p>

<p>5. Whether a State may refuse to consider the issuance of an
occupational Limited License to those individuals in the suspect
class of Medical Necessity Users of a controlled Substance who's actions
are justified within the definitions set forth in Section 503 of
the Uniform Crimes Code.</p>

<p><tt>Dear Dr. Abrams:</tt></p>

<p><tt>We have reviewed your request that the NIH supply
marijuana for a study of the effects of smoked marijuana on
weight changes in persons with HIV-related wasting syndrome.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, we have determined that we cannot comply with your
request.</tt></p>

<p><tt>As you know, decisions for the commitment of limited NIH
resources are based upon scientific principles, so as to ensure
the most effictive use of our research resources.&nbsp;  Our decision
here is based upon issues of design, scientific merit and
rationale.&nbsp;  We believe that your study will not adequately answer
the question posed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Although the study propose seeks to make a dose-effect
comparison of smoked marijuana to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), there is no real dosing control.&nbsp;  The marijuana is to be
taken home and there is no requirement and way to ensure that the
subjects smoke all available materials on any fixed schedule.&nbsp; 
Additionally, that they are given a two-week supply of marijuana
at one time further confounds the study design.&nbsp;  Thus, we believe
the dose-effect component is confounded since the study cannot
correlate variability in weight gain with dosage.</tt></p>

<p><tt>We also believe the study lacks adequate sample size to
make any inferences regarding the dose-effect relationship.&nbsp;  We
base our conclusion on an analogous study performed by the
National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases that
compared megestrol and THC in 56 subject [sic] with AIDS-related
wasting syndrome but still lacked inferential power.&nbsp;  Another
counfounding variable not adequately controlled for in your proposed
study is diet.&nbsp;  Neither the total daily caloric intake nor the percentages
of the composition of the foodstuffs is assessed.</tt></p>

<p><tt>We sincerely share your hope that new treatments will be
found swiftly to improve the quality and prolong the lives of
patients suffering from this terrible disease.&nbsp;  As you know, a
great deal of NIH research support is directed toward this end.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Sincerely,<br>
[signed]<br>

<p><tt>University Of Califoria, San Francisco<br>
School of Medicine<br>
Please address reply to the undersigned at:<br>
UCSF AIDS Program<br>
San Francisco General Hospital<br>
995 Potrero Avenue<br>
Building 80, Ward 84<br>
San Francisco, California 94110</tt></p>

<p><tt>April 28, 1995</tt></p>

<p><tt>Alan I. Leshner, Ph.D<br>
Director<br>
National Institute on Drug Abuse<br>
5600 Fishers Lane<br>
Rockville, Maryland 20857</tt></p>

<p><tt>Dear Dr. Leshner,</tt></p>

<p><tt>I am writing in response to your letter of April 19
regarding my <br>
request that NIDA consider supplying marijuana for the Community <br>
Consortium's proposed study in patients with HIV-related wasting <br>
syndrome. I was not only disappointed by the flat out rejection
of <br>
the request, but also by the way this matter has been handled by
your <br>
Institute from the onset. To receive the first communication from <br>
your office nine months after we sent the initial submission is <br>
offensive and insulting. I realize that this has been a very <br>
difficult decision for you to make because of all the
nonscientific <br>
issues involved, but I am certainly not used to having no <br>
communication at all for nine months from someone with whom I had <br>
corresponded on an official matter. The apparent abscence of any <br>
possibility to discuss your concerns and to modify the protocol <br>
appropriately so that we may work together for the benefit of our <br>
patients is also unacceptable in my opinion.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The National Institute on Drug Abuse has not been the
first body to <br>
review our proposed pilot study. It has been reviewed and
approved <br>
by the Committee on Human Research of the University of
California, <br>
San Francisco, as well as by our own Scientific Advisory
Committee <br>
and Community Advisory Forum. In addition, the study has been <br>
approved (pending location of the source of inhaled marijuana) by
the <br>
California Research Advisory Panel. The US Food and Drug <br>
Administration has also been involved since the onset in
developing <br>
the trial and has strongly influenced the study's design. The <br>
General Clinical Research Center at San Francisco General
Hospital <br>
has agreed to collaborate in the study by providing dietary <br>
counseling and monitoring of patients, as well as performing the <br>
state-of-the-art composition measurements we intend to perform. <br>
Collaborating investigators at Chiron Corporation were also eager
to<br>
participate in this study by donating their newly developed <br>
technology to assess HIV viral burden in patients randomized to <br>
receive marijuana. Hence, your concerns about the scientific
merit <br>
of the study have not been shared by a number of competent
reviewers <br>
and investigators.</tt></p>

<p><tt>To respond to your concerns in a timely manner, I will
address each <br>
issue you raise in turn. However, it is important to stress that <br>
this trial was designed as a pilot study to determine the
feasibility <br>
of conducting a larger study and, in particular, the sample size <br>
required to evaluate the efficacy of inhaled marijuana. As you
know, <br>
the use of a pilot study in clinical research is a
well-established <br>
procedure. I am sure you would agree that it is a prudent
strategy <br>
to conduct a small pilot trial of inhaled marijuana prior to
launching<br>
the definitive efficacy trial that would require a much larger
sample <br>
size.</tt></p>

<p><tt>We fully appreciate that the current pilot study would not
be <br>
adequate to &quot;make any inferences regarding the dose-effect <br>
relationship.&quot; However, we would be able to determine
whether a dose <br>
was associated with an intolerable rate of side effects, and that <br>
dose would then be eliminated from a larger efficacy trial. As <br>
indicated in the protocol, we plan to do intensive monitoring of <br>
pulmonary and immune function as well as HIV viral load in our <br>
patients. If we saw that inhalation of marijuana was detrimental
to <br>
any of these parameters, that information would be crucial to
share <br>
with others in order to protect the safety of patients who are <br>
already using inhaled marijuana (from other sources). The current <br>
pilot study certainly should be large enough (with 30 patients <br>
smoking marijuana) to assess such possible detrimental effects.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The Community Consortium conducts community-based clinical
trials of <br>
treatments that are being widely used by the patient population
and, <br>
as I am sure you are aware, individuals with access are currently <br>
utilizing inhaled marijuana. Our aim is to assess the impact of <br>
treatments that we study in &quot;real world&quot; situations. As
you know, <br>
with whatever drug one studies in a clinical trial, we can never
be <br>
truly certain that patients are consuming 100% of their assigned <br>
doses. Even for treatment of Pneumococcal pneumonia, very few <br>
patients treated actually complete their full course of
penicillin. <br>
Similarly, zidovudine (AZT) was approved as the first
antiretroviral <br>
agent for treating HIV infectioin, and we know that compliance in <br>
those trials was not 100%. In our study, we plan to ask patients
to <br>
quantitate how much of their allotted marijuana they smoked on
any <br>
given day. We also plan to have patients return any unused
marijuana <br>
so we can assess how much they actually usilized. Whether they <br>
actually smoked all that they were given at each visit is
irrelevant <br>
when an intent-to-treat analysis is utilized for data analysis.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Your concerns about total daily caloric intake and
&quot;the percentages <br>
of the composition of the foodstuffs&quot; are a bit extreme, in
my <br>
opinion, but do not present insurmountable problems for us. As
the <br>
General Clinical Research Center at San Francisco General
Hospital is <br>
our collaborating site where patients will go to be taught how to
use <br>
the water pipe for inhalation, and where they will return for all
of <br>
their follow-up evaluations, obtaining this dietary information
is <br>
certainly possible. In fact, this is the sort of information that <br>
the GCRC specializes in collecting! Though we could add this <br>
requirement, it would be a major inconvience to these already ill <br>
patients to ask them to collect this information on a daily basis <br>
during the trial. Of course, another option is to admit all
patients <br>
on the study to the GCR for the duration of their participation
in <br>
the study, so that all intake and output can be accurately
assessed. <br>
Once again, however, that is not how patients would be living
while <br>
they utilized the intervention in the real world, so the value of <br>
data obtained in this fashion is, in my mind, unclear. It
certainly <br>
does not reflect the &quot;real world&quot; usage.</tt></p>

<p><tt>As an AIDS investigator who has worked closely with
National <br>
Institutes of Health and the US Food and Drug Administration for
the <br>
past 14 years of this epidemic, I must tell you that dealing with <br>
your Institute has been the worst experience of my career! The
lack <br>
of any official communication for nine months is unheard of, even
in <br>
the most cumbersome of government bureaucracies. In fact, I was
so <br>
shocked to finally receive your communication that I failed to
detach <br>
the green postcard to verify receipt. I apologize to you, and to <br>
your staff who called for three consecutive days to make sure the <br>
letter had arrived.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Finally, the &quot;sincerity&quot; with which you share my
&quot;hope that new <br>
treatments will be found swiftly&quot; feels so hypocritical that
it makes <br>
me cringe. Believe it or not, I wish I had never needed to
approach <br>
NIDA with this request. The Community Consortium had a source of <br>
marijuana established for this study from the onset.
Unfortunately, <br>
the source was foreign and the FDA advised us that the DEA was
having <br>
difficulty with the importation issue and suggested we contact
you. <br>
(The DEA has also been less than forthcoming in responding to my <br>
request for a Schedule I license sent to them April 15, 1994.)</tt></p>

<p><tt>Obviously, your letter leaves no door open for further
discussion as <br>
to how this pilot study could be modified so that we could work <br>
together. Hence, I will not bother you further. Your letter will
be <br>
widely distributed. You had an opportunity to do a service to the <br>
community of people living with AIDS. You and your Institute
failed. <br>
In the words of the AIDS activist community: SHAME!</tt></p>

<p><tt>Sincerely,</tt></p>

<pre>WEST / SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS / MAY 14, 1995 
 
Marijuana is said to relieve the suffering of people with cancer, 
AIDS and other diseases.  But are our drug laws Nipping 
Compassion in the Bud? 
 
Cover story: Reefer madness 
By Tracie Cone 
 
[picture] 
 
They are law-abiding citizens, but they or someone they love are 
suffering from grave illnesses, and pharmaceuticals don't ease 
the pain.  So they come to places like the Cannabis Buyers Club.  
Above, Hazel Rodgers signs up a new patient, Danny O'Dell, who 
came from Texas. 
 
Reefer MADNESS 
Story by Tracie Cone 
 
Law-abiding regular folks descend into a netherworld to get 
relief for themselves or others with grave diseases.  Why 
morphine and not marijuana? 
 
IT'S DUSK ON THE HIGHWAY, the time when the sun disappears and 
the dwindling light makes objects hard to discern.  I see a car 
growing larger in my rearview mirror, but what's that on the 
roof?  It registers: a police car-with lights and siren off for a 
sneak attack.  My heart pounds so hard my throat hurts.  I clutch 
my steering wheel with 
sweaty palms. 
   I decide I've been under surveillance since I broke state and 
federal law 15 minutes earlier in Santa Cruz.  My trunk holds 
marijuana amid golf clubs and dry cleaning.  Who would buy the 
story that I'm taking it to a sick friend? 
   Yet I am.  She is waiting at home, her gut churning from her 
latest round of cancer treatment, and this is the substance she 
prays will finally bring relief.  We had read of people who smoke 
marijuana to ease the nausea of chemotherapy.  She decided to try 
it after her prescription medication caused near-deadly 
complications. 
   The prospect of jail is viewed as just another indignity to 
people who are dying and will try anything to feel good again.  
When a life is at stake, the rule books often get chucked, no 
matter how law-abiding the person may be. 
   &quot;What have I got to lose?&quot; she had asked. 
   Near the Pajaro River, I poise my hand on my blink- 
 
POT 
 
er.  Maybe a final act of traffic-law compliance will make the 
police go easy on me. 
   The car rides my bumper for a second, then pulls to the left 
and darts past.  It's only a Honda Accord with a ski rack on the 
top.  I sigh at the trick played by my paranoid brain and drive 
home under the comforting cover of darkness. 
 
POSSESSING MARIJUANA makes criminals out people who use it to 
reverse the &quot;wasting syndrome&quot; of AIDS, relax spastic muscles, 
stifle epileptic seizures or ease the symptoms of a dozen other 
ailments.  It is a misdemeanor in California to possess less than 
an ounce.  People who deliver it to ailing friends are committing 
a felony. 
   These users rarely fit the law-enforcement profile.  They're 
not social misfits looking for a legal way to get high.  It is 
not a &quot;gateway&quot; to the land of LSD and crack cocaine.  They are 
simply doing what many sick people have done since ancient 
Egyptians smoked the leaves to cure headaches. 
   Studies have shown that the THC in marijuana, along with some 
combination of its 460 known compounds, eases nausea in 
chemotherapy patients and reduces eye pressure in people 
suffering from blinding glaucoma. 
   Yet the federal Government, spending billions in a popular war 
on drugs, halted all research that might prove whether the plant 
is more effective with some people than synthetic drugs on the 
market. 
   It's absurd that medical decisions are being made by 
politicians,&quot; says Dr. Arnold Jeffe, a Santa Cruz physician.  
&quot;It's so crazy that this has become such a big deal when, really, 
it's not a big deal at all.&quot; 
   Politics made marijuana illegal in 1937 and politics might 
soon put it legally back in doctors' hands.  San Jose Assemblyman 
John Vasconcellos has introduced a compassionate-use bill that 
would allow sick people to use marijuana. 
   &quot;If people are in pain they ought to be able to use marijuana 
to relieve their pain,&quot; Vasconcellos said.  &quot;It's none of the 
government's business in the first place.&quot; 
   Should the bill fail, the San Francisco-based group 
Californians for Compassionate Use has hired a political 
consultant to get the issue on the November 1996 ballot. 
   The proposition would make Californians the first in the 
country to decide a medical marijuana law, and the group -- AIDS 
activists skilled in the art of lobbying and sick people who 
depend on the drug -- believes the referendum has a chance. 
   They are encouraged by a recent statewide survey they 
commissioned showing that while few Californians want to make 
marijuana legal, 66 percent of the 750 randomly questioned 
respondents would support a law allowing sick people to use it 
with a doctor's prescription. 
   The law would turn Salinas retirees Dorothy 
 
14 / MAY 14, 1995 / W E S T 
 
and Richard Haskell into law-abiding citizens again.  They 
provide marijuana to their 44-year-old daughter, Vicki, who has 
liver cancer. 
   &quot;Umm, we just want it for, well, medicinal purposes,&quot; Dorothy 
Haskell said.  &quot;It breaks our hearts to see our daughter suffer.&quot; 
 
FOR 25 YEARS the medical marijuana battle has been waged politely 
by people with glaucoma and cancer.  Now it is becoming the 
vocal, in-your-face fight of AIDS patients who say marijuana's 
appetite-inducing side effect keeps them from wasting away.  AIDS 
activists just might succeed where others have not: They already 
have forced the Food and Drug Administration to make experimental 
drugs available years ahead of schedule. 
   &quot;I've been very conscious of the difference between AIDS 
patients and cancer and glaucoma patients,&quot; says Robert Randall 
of the non-profit Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, based in 
Washington, D.C.  &quot;AIDS patients tend to be a part of a powerful, 
organized community of people who are suffering.  They look out 
for each other.&quot; 
   AIDS activists were a big part of successful marijuana 
referendums in San Francisco and Santa Cruz counties.  Eighty 
percent of voters in San Francisco, and 77 percent in Santa Cruz, 
approved resolutions supporting the use of pot for medical 
reasons. 
   Medical marijuana advocates want to modify a law that has been 
in place since 1970.  That's when the FDA and Drug Enforcement 
Agency ruled that the peace movement's drug of choice is as 
useless to medical science as LSD and heroin.  All three became 
classified as Schedule 1 narcotics -- drugs with no known medical 
use. 
   Morphine, cocaine and even Marinol -- a synthetic derivative 
of marijuana's Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -- are Schedule 
2, which means doctors can prescribe them.  Medical marijuana 
advocates argue that Marinol often doesn't work as well as the 
real thing -- especially in a vomiting patient -- and want the 
plant moved to Schedule 2. 
   In April 300 people -- many sick or dying, on crutches and in 
wheelchairs, in suits and leather, Gray Panthers and gay 
activists -- gathered on the steps of the U.S. Federal Building 
in San Francisco to draw attention to the fight. 
   &quot;This is our Stonewall!&quot; shouted referendum leader Dennis 
Peron, comparing the marijuana battle to New York's historic gay 
freedom struggle.  &quot;They are not going to drive us back into our 
closets.  I think back to '65 when cops were dragging our friends 
to jail -- and now cops want to take AIDS patients to jail.&quot; 
   With TV cameras rolling and tour buses creeping by, they dared 
the DEA to arrest them all. 
   Martin Simmons, 32, scooted his wheelchair to the front of the 
crowd and screamed the chant: 
   Racist, sexist, anti-gay 
   DEA, go away. 
   &quot;I'm dying,&quot; Simmons, an AIDS patient, said afterward.  &quot;F--- 
the law.&quot; 
 
RICHARD AND DOROTHY HASKELL are proof that need is the thing most 
likely to convince someone with anti-drug views to accept medical 
marijuana.  My friend had never even seen marijuana. 
   I often drove her to the hospital and witnessed the horrendous 
nausea she suffered after treatment.  Prescription drugs were 
supposed to settle her stomach, but every day we stopped two or 
three times on the way home for her dry heaves to pass.  At home, 
she vomited more.  She lost the desire to eat and quickly dropped 
15 pounds, which in turn made her too weak to withstand strong 
treatment. 
   This is what cancer sufferers say about anti-nausea drugs such 
as Zofran (which costs $600 a dose) and Torecan: The side effects 
can be worse than the problems they're designed to prevent.  
Sometimes, it's a headache, stupor or insomnia.  My friend's 
pharmaceutical, besides not curing her nausea, constipated her. 
   In most people, that would be uncomfortable but not deadly.  
But doctors continued giving her the toxic chemical they hoped 
would kill her cancer cells, and it wasn't leaving her body.  In 
the car beside me one evening, after a violent burst of dry 
heaves, she stopped breathing.  I beat on her chest, screamed 
frantically and started CPR: 
   &quot;Please breathe.  Come back.  Please don't die.&quot; 
   She didn't die, and later I told her about my aunt who had 
smoked pot while undergoing chemotherapy for liver cancer.  My 
friend has a medicine cabinet full of painkillers, but had never 
tried an illegal drug.  Now she was desperate. 
   I asked friends about buying marijuana on the black market 
which, law enforcement should be happy to hear, doesn't seem as 
active as it was a decade ago.  Instead I found the medical 
marijua-

na underground. 
 
MY FIRST VISIT was with Scott Imler, who runs Citizens for 
Medical Marijuana in Santa Cruz. 
   On the cramped top floor of an old downtown Victorian, Imler 
dispenses advice and marijuana to people he believes are sincere.  
It helps if they have a note from their doctor -- and almost all 
the patients Imler helps do.  He keeps records on a computer, and 
a stash in the closet.  He sent me home with a good supply of 
prime sinsemilla buds. 
   Imler, 37, used to be a special education teacher.  He grew 
pot in the late '80s to supply sick friends in San Francisco.  In 
1992, after sheriffs deputies seized his crop, he worked to pass 
the Santa Cruz County compassionate-use referendum. 
   Dennis Peron of San Francisco sold marijuana in the 1960s and 
'70s as the drug culture thrived.  In the late '80s he discovered 
a higher purpose for law-breaking when his lover, dying of AIDS, 
used marijuana to stimulate his appetite.  Looking respectable 
with Gap clothes and a gray banker-style haircut, Peron now sells 
marijuana to sick people who can afford it, and gives it to those 
who can't at his Cannabis Buyers Club, an illegal reefer pharmacy 
in the city's Castro district. 
   Peron founded the statewide referendum group earlier this year 
and counts on his buyers club members for support.  One Friday in 
April, however, Peron abruptly closed the doors after he received 
a tip: The Drug Enforcement Agency would bust him that afternoon.  
He quickly organized the protest outside the Federal Building 
because customers were returning to dark Tenderloin street 
corners or Dolores Park to find supplies. 
   &quot;I haven't eaten in days, I can't sleep,&quot; Martin Simmons said.  
&quot;I don't know what else to do.&quot; 
   Valerie and Mike Corral of Davenport began growing marijuana 
20 years ago, after reading that it could control Valerie's 
epileptic seizures.  Now they grow enough to share with about a 
dozen people, all of them dying, who find them by word-of-mouth.  
With her bobbed hair, slacks and pumps, Valerie, 42, looks more 
Junior Leaguer than pot grower. 
   Once a week at her mountaintop cabin, she hunches over a 
tattered &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; and modifies the traditional Butter 
Thin cookie recipe.  Using marijuana instead of flour, she 
produces a green cookie that will  induce the same effect as 
smoked marijuana after it meanders through the digestive system. 
   Santa Cruz County Sheriffs deputies have arrested Corral twice 
and destroyed her plants.  Yet even the prospect of prison does 
not stop her. 
   &quot;There's not a person who could violate me more than a 
seizure, so I have no fear of cops,&quot; she says. 
   May is planting time, and Valerie and Mike are preparing the 
greenhouse.  They plant &quot;Luther Burbank style,&quot; growing 100 
seedlings, but keeping only the five or six female plants that 
develop the bushy foliage they're looking for.  They might net 15 
pounds in a season. 
   &quot;We've learned how to grow healthy plants and get a high 
yield,&quot; says Mike, who has collected seeds for 20 years.  &quot;It's 
genetics.&quot; 
   One recipient of their pot is Bill Shanteau, 44, a Cabrillo 
College instructor who is in the final stages of colon cancer.  
He waits in bed for the weekly delivery that brings physical, 
psychological and psychokinetic relief.  Yes, sometimes Shanteau 
just wants to get high. 
   &quot;The point is,&quot; Shanteau says, &quot;marijuana is a major agent in 
keeping me interested in life.  Besides restoring my appetite, 
it's like a hot tub for the brain.  It stimulates me 
intellectually.  It keeps me focused in the moment instead of me 
sitting here thinking I'm dying tomorrow.  I hate to think what 
my life would be like right now if I didn't have it.&quot; 
   Shanteau's desire to get high complicates the issue.  
Marijuana doesn't only ease nausea in sick people; it also makes 
them high.  This troubles pot foes, who see the potential for 
abuse and distrust the motives of the people who are pushing 
medical marijuana.  Last year in Sacramento, a woman publicly 
lashed out at Valerie Corral: 
   &quot;She said, 'You People just want to feel good,'&quot; Corral 
recalls.  &quot;And I said, 'Yeah?  So?  What's the crime in a sick 
person wanting to feel good?'&quot; 
 
TOM GORMAN OF SACRAMENTO cringes when people say anything good 
about marijuana.  A member of the California Narcotics Officers 
Association, Gorman says that stories of medical miracles are 
propaganda from people who want to decriminalize drugs. 
   &quot;If you were dying of cancer,&quot; says the 27-year veteran of law 
enforcement, you'd probably grasp at anything.  But smoking 
anything is not good for you.  What we're doing in the '90s is 
the exact same thing we did in the '70s -- we're romanticizing 
drugs.  Once you get a soft attitude, kids get the impression 
it's not so bad.&quot; 
   Gov. Pete Wilson agrees.  In 1994 he vetoed a medical 
marijuana bill passed by the Legislature.  An aide says Wilson 
will veto the Vasconcellos bill if it lands on his desk. 
   &quot;The governor believes it would serve no useful purposes&quot; says 
spokesman Jesus Arredondo, &quot;when the FDA has already concluded 
that marijuana is not good.&quot; 
   The California Medical Association says marijuana, used under 
a doctor's order, is often beneficial.  The American Medical 
Association, the only group originally to speak against Congress' 
1937 ban, has not taken a stand, but supports more research. 
   The American Bar Association, the National Association of 
Attorneys General and the Conference of Episcopal Bishops are 
among the groups calling for the repeal of laws against medical 
marijuana.  Legislators in 35 states, including California, have 
passed non-binding resolutions supporting its use. 
   From the '40s through the '60s, as science refined 
pharmaceutical drugs, the medical community began thinking of 
herbs and botanical treatments as old-fashioned.  But in the 
'70s, recreational users inadvertently discovered marijuana's 
value to modern medicine; researchers reported that cancer 
patients they had treated felt better after using the drug. 
   Robert Randall of the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics has 
glaucoma.  In 1976, after a lawsuit and weeks of tests at the 
Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA, he became the first person in 
the United States to receive marijuana from the federal 
government.  By then he was nearly blind and the tests showed 
that only marijuana -- not any prescription drug -- would lower 
his eye pressure and save his sight.  The government, he says, 
had had that information since 1971. 
   &quot;The prospect that an easily grown plant can ease human 
suffering should be a cause for celebration,&quot; he says.  &quot;The 
problem is, we don't live in a sane society.&quot; 
   Randall says he smokes pot every day.  He still has limited 
eyesight. 
   From 1978 to 1986, New Mexico health officials tested 
marijuana on cancer patients who were not helped by other anti-
nausea treatment; 90 percent reported improvement.  A study in 
New York showed that 78 percent of 56 cancer patients who didn't 
respond to other drugs felt better after smoking marijuana.  The 
study, published in 1988, also tested the synthetic THC:  One-
third of the patients who did not feel better using it did show 
improvement after smoking marijuana. 
   By 1991, the federal government, still denying marijuana's 
benefits, was shipping it to 12 people suffering from cancer 
nausea, glaucoma, chronic pain and muscle spasms associated with 
multiple sclerosis.  Randall encouraged people with AIDS to 
apply, as he had, for an application to use an unproven drug.  It 
was a program established by Jimmy Carter after Randall's case 
became public. 
   Meanwhile, doctors began accepting the use of medical 
marijuana.  A 1991 study by Rick Doblin, a Ph.D. candidate at 
Harvard's Kennedy School, found that 44 percent of the 1,000 
cancer specialists who responded to a nationwide survey have told 
patients that marijuana could relieve nausea.  More than half of 
the oncologists surveyed said it should be available by 
prescription. 
   Some doctors believe that not telling their patients is cruel. 
   &quot;I have patients who say that it helps them, and I recommend 
it to patients,&quot; says Dr. Leff, 53, of Santa Cruz, who was 
Cincinnati's Drug and Alcohol Abuse director in the early 1970s.  
&quot;[Recommending marijuana] is not unusual.  It's only a big deal 
to people with religious or moralistic views about the drug.&quot; 
   The FDA, swamped with thousands of unproven drug applications, 
had approved about two dozen more patients by late 1991.  But the 
Public Health Service under George Bush quietly stopped approving 
new participants and ended all marijuana research programs.  The 
patients already approved but still waiting for marijuana were 
out of luck.  Today the government provides marijuana to only 
eight of the original 12 patients. (The other four have died.) 
   &quot;There was a sense, with so many people applying, that we 
wouldn't have enough marijuana to provide,&quot; said Rayford Kytle of 
the PHS, which grows a small crop in Mississippi. 
   The PHS supported the Bush administration decision by saying 
that smoking marijuana, like cigarettes, can cause lung cancer.  
The PHS further warned that smoking it can compromise immune 
systems already made fragile by AIDS or other diseases.  And 
being under the influence can cause anxiety. 
   Bill Clinton, who says he tried marijuana but didn't inhale, 
has upheld the ban.  His administration added a provision, 
however, that allows research into medical benefits. 
   Dr. Donald Abrams, assistant director of the AIDS project at 
San Francisco General Hospital, sought approval to study 
marijuana's effects on the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS.  
&quot;The study would not only see whether it's effective, but whether 
it's harmful,&quot; Abrams says.

   He hoped to study 40 people -- too few to settle the marijuana 
question but enough to determine whether more research is 
warranted.  He applied to the FDA, the DEA and a state agency 
that oversees California university research programs.  The state 
approved the study and the FDA signed off after insisting on 
numerous chances.  On April 15, 1994, Abrams crossed what he 
thought would be the final hurdle when he paid the DEA for a 
license to distribute a Schedule I drug.  The DEA cashed the 
check, but has yet to approve the research. 
   &quot;Everything I hear is from unofficial channels,&quot; Abrams said.  
&quot;They said they didn't trust my research, or they questioned my 
credibility.  Nobody can give me a direct answer on why this is 
taking so long.&quot; 
   A federal health official offered this reason: &quot;It' s too 
volatile an issue with the anti-drug people.  It's a shame they 
can't distinguish between a small group of medically needy people 
and drug abusers.&quot; 
   Abrams' struggle has had an unfortunate side effect: It has 
discouraged others from applying. 
   &quot;Political pressure has demoralized researchers,&quot; Doblin says.  
&quot;It has made it hard to get money for research.  If Donald 
doesn't get permission, nobody is going to try.&quot; 
   Few issues besides abortion produce such distrust between 
camps.  Marijuana opponents say we can't say &quot;no&quot; to most drugs 
but &quot;yes&quot; to one.  They say there are enough medications on the 
market to provide relief.  Few politicians want to be viewed as 
being soft on drugs. 
   The marijuana proponents counter that the government policy is 
set by pharmaceutical manufacturers who stand to lose billions of 
dollars in anti-nausea drug sales to a plant they cannot patent.  
Proponents say medical professionals not bureaucrats, should 
decide health-care issues. 
   &quot;They're probably right,&quot; says the federal health official, 
who asked for anonymity, &quot;but until people convince their 
congressional representatives that the law needs to be changed, 
nothing will be done.&quot; 
   In 1988, after two years of public hearings, the DEA's own 
chief administrative law judge said the drug agency should 
rewrite its marijuana policy. 
   &quot;It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to 
continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefit of this 
substance in light of the evidence of this record,&quot; Judge Francis 
L. Young said. 
 
MY FRIEND, who has never smoked a cigarette, didn't know how to 
inhale her marijuana.  We made a pipe by rolling aluminum foil 
into a tube, then bending one end up slightly.  We rolled some 
into joints. 
   After smoking a few puffs, or eating one of Corral's cookies, 
my friend had little nausea.  She could eat real food again. 
   In four weeks she regained her weight.  Her face was full, her 
cheeks pink.  Her eyes, which often seemed dull and half closed, 
were open and bright.  We drove home from the hospital without 
ever stopping again. 
   &quot;If the government wants to find out whether marijuana can 
stop cancer patients and AIDS sufferers from throwing up and 
losing weight -- put them on a scale,&quot; Randall says. 
   Dorothy and Richard Haskell decided in March that breaking the 
law was preferable to watching Vicki suffer. 
   &quot;We were always anti-drug,&quot; Dorothy says.  &quot;It just wasn't the 
way we lived.&quot; 
   Vicki's pain medication had stopped working.  She couldn't 
sleep or keep food down.  The Haskells read about medical 
marijuana but didn't know where to find any until they read an 
article in which Imler was quoted. 
   When the Haskells stepped inside Imler's headquarters, they 
looked as if one more worry would break them.  From the parlor 
wafted the click of typewriter keys as Ed Frey, attorney and 
former D.A. candidate, worked in his office.  Imler gets free 
office space and a small salary to work as Frey's assistant.  The 
couple stammered nervously. 
   &quot;Anyone who has ever had a child can tell you why we're here,&quot; 
Dorothy said.  &quot;It breaks our hearts to see our daughter suffer.&quot; 
   &quot;I just want her to be able to sleep, she's in so much pain,&quot; 
Richard said.  &quot;It's our daughter, so as far as I'm concerned, 
I'm not doing anything illegal.&quot; 
   All day, Imler helps people like the Haskells, fields phone 
calls, teaches clients to grow pot for themselves, and solicits 
donations. 
   &quot;We have an uneasy accommodation with local law enforcement 
here,&quot; he says.  &quot;They know we're here, but so far we've been 
lucky.&quot; 
   Politicians know the voters in Santa Cruz County believe sick 
people should be allowed marijuana if they want it.  And Santa 
Cruz police say they are aware that medical marijuana proponents 
are active in town, but they are too busy to investigate the 
movement. 
   &quot;We don't have enough personnel to enjoy the luxury of sitting 
around and wondering what they're doing,&quot; says deputy police 
chief Jeff Locke.  &quot;But our feeling is still that it's against 
the law.&quot; 
   In March, Imler received a letter from Dr. Stephen Stein, 
medical director of the County of Santa Cruz Health Services 
Agency, asking him to provide marijuana to an AIDS patient. 
   &quot;[The patient] reports using marijuana to treat symptoms of 
nausea and anorexia,&quot; Stein wrote.  &quot;I have no objection to him 
using it for this purpose.&quot; 
   The local attitude makes District Attorney Art Danner wonder 
whether prosecuting a medical marijuana case would waste 
taxpayers money.  That's part of the reason he has declined to 
prosecute Valerie Corral both times sheriffs deputies arrested 
her. 
   A trial would cost thousands, and a loss would demoralize law 
enforcement. 
   &quot;Hers was a difficult case,&quot; he says.  &quot;I don't think I could 
get a jury to convict her.  It's a difficult situation here.  On 
the one hand, we have a lot of terminally ill people using it.  
On the other hand, we don't want everyone with a headache to use 
it.&quot; 
   Danner, a member of the National Association of District 
Attorneys' Executive Committee, has asked the group to take up 
the issue at its annual convention in July. 
   &quot;I suggested we take a good look at the research and see 
whether it should be moved from the legal to medical 
jurisdiction,&quot; Danner says.  &quot;I got a lot of interest from other 
D.A.s whose constituents are talking to them about this issue.  
They were more interested than I thought they'd be.&quot; 
   About the time the district attorneys meet, members of 
Californians for Compassionate Use will begin collecting the 
signatures of 433,000 registered voters.  The drive is being 
conducted by Ken Masterton, a political consultant who qualified 
recent successful propositions protecting mountain lions and 
increasing the tobacco tax. 
 
THE HASKELLS were unaware of the various political movements when 
they visited Imler in March. 
   To them, marijuana was a last resort; a trip to the downtown 
head shop for a pipe too strange to consider. 
   &quot;Uh, no, please, we can't go in there,&quot; Dorothy begged.

   Imler gave them joints instead of a pipe.  Richard held the 
sealed envelope and folded it in half.  He searched his pockets 
for a paper clip and nervously affixed the halves together.  He 
put the package in his pocket and realized the group had been 
watching him fumble. 
   &quot;Oh, I don't know what I'm doing,&quot; he said. 
   Before leaving for their own nerve-racked drive home, the 
Haskells gave Imler a $50 bill.  It is a huge donation for a 
shoestring operation dependent upon the kindness of strangers.  
Timing was good.  Donations of pot and money are off.  Imler's 
stash has been of such bad quality lately that even home health-
care nurses have called to complain. 
   Back in Salinas, Vicki, who has two high school-age sons, 
attempted to try the marijuana.  Stigma proved a powerful 
deterrent. 
   &quot;She didn't want to do it in front of her kids,&quot; Dorothy 
Haskell said.  &quot;She's back in the hospital now, trying to get her 
pain medication  regulated.  I don't think she gave it a chance 
because she thought it was really wrong.  I even took a couple of 
puffs myself so she would think it was OK.  If your child is 
involved, you'll do anything.&quot; 
 
IN MID-APRIL Vicki Haskell turned worse.  After trying every pain 
medication prescribed by her doctor, she smoked the marijuana.  
After weeks of insomnia, she was able to sleep through the night.  
On April 12, Richard and Dorothy drove back to Santa Cruz to get 
more. 
   &quot;Every time someone like that leaves, I say, Now I know why 
we're here,&quot; Imler says. 
   Dennis Peron reopened the buyers club a week after he closed 
it.  Martin Simmons was among the 1,500 first-day customers.  
Peron hopes drug agents won't show, and the DEA's Mike Herald 
declined to confirm whether Peron is being investigated.  If the 
DEA comes knocking, Peron threatens, agents will have to arrest 
all 4,000 members. 
   &quot;Tell the jail to stock up on catheters and medical 
equipment,&quot; he says.  &quot;The jail is going to be full of sick 
people. 
   Randall says the marijuana fight reminds him of the struggles 
of Galileo, the 16th-century astronomer.  Galileo saw craters on 
the moon, but the church replied the moon is perfect.  Look 
through the telescope, Galileo implored.  But the church said: 
No, it's an instrument of the devil. 
   &quot;On the one hand, I'm more optimistic now than I've ever 
been,&quot; Randall says.  &quot;AIDS patients have revitalized this 
movement around the world.  Still, bureaucrats resist, even under 
overwhelming evidence they are destroying people's lives.&quot; 
   And that, says Randall, is true reefer madness. 
   My friend recently learned that she is cancer-free for the 
first time in a decade.  Her doctor said part of the reason is 
that she kept on weight. 
   &quot;You kept your strength up,&quot; he told her, &quot;which allowed you 
to withstand the high doses.  I'm trying to determine what 
combination of chemicals may have caused that.&quot; 
   She hopes that someday she will find the courage to tell him.

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<h2>Marihuana as Medicine</h2>

<h3>A Plea for Reconsideration</h3>

<p>BETWEEN 1840 and 1900, European and American medical journals
published more than 100 articles on the therapeutic use of the
drug known then as Cannabis indica (or Indian hemp) and now as
marihuana. It was recommended as an appetite stimulant, muscle
relaxant, analgesic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant. As late as
1913 Sir William Osler recommended it as the most satisfactory
remedy for migraine. </p>

<p>Today the 5000-year medical history of cannabis has been
almost forgotten. Its use declined in the early 20th century
because the potency of preparations was variable, responses to
oral ingestion were erratic, and alternatives became available --
injectable opiates and, later, synthetic drugs such as aspirin
and barbiturates. In the United States, the final blow was struck
by the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. Designed to prevent nonmedical
use, this law made cannabis so difficult to obtain for medical
purposes that it was removed from the pharmacopeia. It is now
confined to Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act as a
drug that has a high potential for abuse, lacks an accepted
medical use, and is unsafe for use under medical supervision. </p>

<p>In 1972 the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
later renamed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to transfer
marihuana to Schedule II so that it could be legally prescribed.
As the proceedings continued, other parties joined, including the
Physicians Association for AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome] Care. It was only in 1986, after many years of legal
maneuvering, that the DEA acceded to the demand for the public
hearings required by law. During the hearings, which lasted 2
years, many patients and physicians testified, and thousands of
pages of documentation were introduced. In 1988 the DEA's own
administrative law judge, Francis L. Young, declared that
marihuana in its natural form fulfilled the legal requirement of
currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.
He added that it was &quot;one of the safest therapeutically
active substances known to man.&quot; His order that the
marihuana plant be transferred to Schedule II was overruled, not
by any medical authority, but by the DEA itself, which issued a final
rejection of all pleas for reclassification in Mach 1992. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a few patients have been able to obtain marihuana
legally for therapeutic purposes. Since 1978, legislation
permitting patients with certain disorders to use marihuana with
a physician's approval has been enacted in 36 states. Although
federal regulations and procedures made the laws difficult to
implement, 10 states eventually established formal marihuana
research programs to seek Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval for Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. These
programs were later abandoned, mainly because the bureaucratic
burden on physicians and patients became intolerable. </p>

<p>Growing demand also forced the FDA to Institute an Individual
Treatment IND (commonly referred to as a Compassionate IND) for
the use of physicians whose patients needed marihuana because no
other drug would produce the same therapeutic effect. The
application process was made enormously complicated, and most
physicians did not want to become involved, especially since many
believed there was some stigma attached to prescribing cannabis.
Between 1976 and 1988 the government reluctantly awarded about a
half dozen Compassionate INDs for the use of marihuana. In 1989
the FDA was deluged with new applications from people with AIDS,
and the number granted rose to 34 within a year. In June 1991,
the Public Health Service announced that the program would be
suspended because it undercut the administration's opposition to
the use of illegal drugs. After that no new Compassionate INDs
were granted, and the program was discontinued in March 1992.
Eight patients are still receiving marihuana under the original
program; for everyone else it is officially a forbidden medicine. </p>

<p>And yet physicians and patients in increasing numbers continue
to relearn through personal experience the lessons of the 19th
century. Many people know that marihuana is now being used illegally
for the nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy. Some know
that it lowers intraocular pressure in glaucoma. Patients have
found it useful as an anticonvulsant, as a muscle relaxant in
spastic disorders, and as an appetite stimulant in the wasting
syndrome of human immunodeficiency virus infection. It is also
being used to relieve phantom limb pain, menstrual cramps, and
other types of chronic pain, including (as Osler might have
predicted) migraine.2 Polls and voter referenda have repeatedly
indicated that the vast majority of Americans think marihuana should
be medically available. </p>

<p>One of marihuana's greatest advantages as a medicine is its
remarkable safety. It has little effect on major physiological
functions. There is no known case of a lethal overdose; on the
basis of animal models, the ratio of lethal to effective dose is
estimated as 40,000 to 1. By comparison, the ratio is between 3
and 50 to 1 for secobarbital and between 4 and 10 to 1 for
ethanol. Marihuana is also far less addictive and far less
subject to abuse than many drugs now used as muscle re- </p>

<p>laxants, hypnotics, and analgesics. The chief legitimate
concern is the effect of smoking on the lungs. Cannabis smoke
carries even more tars and other particulate matter than tobacco
smoke. But the amount smoked is much less, especially in medical
use, and once marihuana is an openly recognized medicine,
solutions may be found. Water pipes are a partial answer;
ultimately a technology for the inhalation of cannabinoid vapors
could be developed. Even If smoking continued, legal availability
would make it easier to take precautions against aspergilli and
other pathogens. At present, the greatest danger in medical use
of marihuana is its illegality, which imposes much anxiety and
expense on suffering people, forces them to bargain with illicit
drug dealers, and exposes them to the threat of criminal
prosecution. </p>

<p>The main active substance in cannabis,
[delta-9]-tetrahydrocannabinol ([delta-9]-THC), has been available
for limited purposes as a Schedule II synthetic drug since 1985.
This medicine, dronabinol (Marinol), taken orally in capsule
form, is sometimes said to obviate the need for medical
marihuana. Patients and physicians who have tried both disagree.
The dosage and duration of action of marihuana are easier to
control, and other cannabinoids in the marihuana plant may modify
the action of [delta-9]-THC. The development of cannabinoids in
pure form should certainly be encouraged, but the time and
resources required are great and at present unavailable. In these
circumstances, further isolation, testing, and development of
individual cannabinoids should not be considered a substitute for
meeting the immediate needs of suffering people. </p>

<p>Although it is often objected that the medical usefulness of
marihuana has not been demonstrated by controlled studies,
several informal experiments involving large numbers of subjects
suggest an advantage for marihuana over oral [delta-9]-THC and
other medicines. For example, from 1978 through 1986 the state
research program in New Mexico provided marihuana or synthetic
[delta-9]-THC to about 250 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy
after conventional medications failed to control their nausea and
vomiting. A physician who worked with the program testified at a
DEA hearing that for these patients marihuana was clearly
superior to both chlorpromazine and synthetic [delta-9]-THC.3 It
is true that we do not have studies controlled according to the
standards required by the FDA -- chiefly because legal,
bureaucratic, and financial obstacles are constantly put in the
way. The situation is ironical, since so much research has been
done on marihuana, often in unsuccessful attempts to prove its
dangerous and addictive character, that we know more about it
than about most prescription drugs. </p>

<p>Physicians should offer more encouragement to controlled
research, but it too has limitations. Individual therapeutic
responses can be obscured by the statistical results of group
experiments in which there is little effort to identify the
specific features of a patient that affect the drug response. Furthermore,
much of our knowledge of synthetic medicines as well as plant
derivatives comes from anecdotal evidence. For example, as early
as 1976 several small, methodologically imperfect, and relatively
obscure studies had shown that taking an aspirin a day could
prevent a second heart attack. In 1988 a large-scale experiment
demonstrated dramatic effects. This story is suggestive, because
marihuana, like aspirin, is a substance known to be unusually
safe and to have enormous potential health benefits. </p>

<p>Cannabis can also bring about immediate relief of suffering
measurable in a study with only one subject. In the experimental
method known as the single patient randomized trial, active and placebo
treatments are administered randomly in alternation or succession
to a patient. The method is often useful when large scale
controlled studies are impossible or inappropriate because the disorder
is rare, the patient is atypical, or the response to the
treatment is idiosyncratic. Many patients, either deliberately or
because of unreliable supplies, have informally carried out
somewhat similar experiments by alternating periods of cannabis
use with periods of no use in the treatment of various
disorders.2(pp.133-135) </p>

<p>The American Medical Association was one of the few
organizations that raised a voice in opposition to the Marihuana
Tax Act of 1937, yet today most physicians seem to take little
active interest in the subject, and their silence is often cited
by those who are determined that marihuana shall remain a
forbidden medicine. Meanwhile, many physicians pretend to ignore
the fact that their patients with cancer, AIDS, or multiple
sclerosis are smoking marihuana for relief; some quietly encourage
them. In a 1990 survey, 44% of oncologists said they had
suggested that a patient smoke marihuana for relief of the nausea
induced by chemotherapy.4 If marihuana were actually unsafe for
use even under medical supervision, as its Schedule I status
explicitly affirms, this recommendation would be unthinkable. It
is time for physicians to acknowledge more openly that the
present classification is scientifically, legally, and morally
wrong. </p>

<p>Physicians have both a right and a duty to be skeptical about
therapeutic claims for any substance, but only after putting
aside fears and doubts connected with the stigma of illicit
nonmedical drug use. Advocates of medical use of marihuana are
sometimes charged with using medicine as a wedge to open a way
for &quot;recreational&quot; use. The accusation is false as
applied to its target, but expresses in a distorted form a truth
about some opponents of medical marihuana; they will not admit
that it can be a safe and effective medicine largely because they
are stubbornly committed to exaggerating its dangers when used
for nonmedical purposes. </p>

<p>We are not asking readers for immediate agreement with our
affirmation that marihuana is medically useful, but we hope they
will do more to encourage open and legal exploration of its potential.
The ostensible indifference of physicians should no longer be
used as a justification for keeping this medicine in the shadows. </p>

<pre>Dear Colleague:</pre>

<pre>I am very pleased to invite you to attend the National conference on 
Marijuana Use:  Prevention, Treatment, and Researh, sponsored by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health 
(NIH).  This is the first national conference to focus on providing 
scientifically based information on marijuana to dispel myths, increase 
public awareness of the rising trends in marijuana use, and educate the 
public about the consequences of marijuana use, especially for young 
people.  Another purpose is to educate the drug abuse prevention and 
treatment communities about research results that can assist in prevention 
and treatment efforts.</pre>

<pre>This conference is one of the principal elements in the Marijuana 
Prevention Initiative, which the Secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, announced last December when she 
released the results of the 1994 Monitoring the Future study.  It responds 
to the significant upturns in marijuana use among 8th, 10th, and 12th 
grade students.</pre>

<pre>The conference will present outcomes of NIDA/NIH research that focus on:  
Extent of the Problem; What Marijuana Is, What It Does, and Where It Acts; 
Consequenses of Marijuana Use; and Research-Based Prevention and Treatment 
Approaches.  Scientists, the public, and practitioners will exchange 
information that can be disseminated through the media, national 
organizations, educators, juvenile justice authorities, and State and 
local antidrug coalitions.</pre>

<pre>We are very concerned about the significant increased use of marijuana, 
especially by young people.  This conference will synthesize and begin to 
disseminate scientifically accurate information about the consequences of 
marijuana use.  We know it will be useful to all who attend.</pre>

<pre>I encourage you to attend the conference.</pre>

<pre>                                    Sincerely,
                                    Alan I. Leshner, Ph.D.

available medicines.</font><a href="#1"><font size="2"><sup>1</sup></font></a><font

size="4">&nbsp; The U.S. government has consistently refused to
permit prescription sales of marijuana, insisting that the
evidence of its safety and efficacy is inadequate. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">In response to a lawsuit brought by advocates of the medical use
of marijuana, an administrative law judge with the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA) recommended in 1988 that the
federal legal classification of marijuana be changed so that
physicians can prescribe it.</font><a href="#3"><font size="2"><sup>3</sup></font></a><font
size="4">&nbsp; The DEA did not implement the
recommendation.&nbsp; In 1992, Richard Bonner, then DEA administrator,
offered this suggestion: &quot;Those who insist that marihuana
has medical uses would serve society better by promoting or
sponsoring more legitimate scientific research, rather than
throwing their time, money, and rhetoric into lobbying, public
relations campaigns, and perennial litigation.&quot;</font><a
href="#4"><font size="2"><sup>4</sup></font></a><font size="4"> <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Encouraged by this declaration, Donald Abrams, of the University
of California, San Francisco, sought permission to conduct a
privately financed pilot study comparing three potencies of
inhaled marijuana (high, medium, and low) with oral
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol) capsules, which are available
by prescription in the United States, for the treatment of weight
loss associated with the AIDS wasting syndrome.&nbsp; Dr.
Abrams's protocol (Investigational New Drug No. 43,542) was
designed in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and approved by the FDA, the University of California, San
Francisco, institutional review board, the California Research
Advisory Panel, and the scientific advisory committee of the San
Francisco Community Consortium. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Unfortunately, the U.S. government will not allow Dr. Abrams to
obtain a legal supply of marijuana.&nbsp; The DEA refused to
permit him to import marijuana from Hortapharm, a company
licensed by the government of the Netherlands to cultivate
cannabis for botanical and pharmaceutical research.&nbsp; The
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which controls the
domestic supply of marijuana for clinical research, rejected Dr.
Abrams's request in April 1995.&nbsp; The letter of rejection,
from NIDA director Alan I. Leshner, was sent nine months after
Dr. Abrams had submitted his request. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Given the limited sources of support for research on marijuana (pharmaceutical
companies, for example, are not interested in supporting such research),
the U.S. government by now should have taken note of the increasingly
persuasive therapeutic claims and sponsored its own clinical
trials through the National Institutes of Health.&nbsp; Instead,
as Dr. Bonner's remark and the handling of Dr. Abrams's protocol
indicate, the government has responded by urging others to
investigate the medical potential of marijuana and then creating
obstacles that make the research impossible to pursue.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><spacer type="horizontal" size="25"><i>To the Editor:</i> The San
Francisco Community Consortium is an association of providers of
care for patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) in the San Francisco Bay area.&nbsp; The consortium
conducts community-based clinical trials of therapies of
potential benefit to our patients.&nbsp; Inhaled marijuana is
being used increasingly by people with HIV infection, especially
for its purported benefit as an anti-emetic agent and an appetite stimulant
in those with the AIDS wasting syndrome.&nbsp; Up to 2000 people infected
with HIV are reported to be obtaining marijuana at a cannabis
buyer's club in our area.&nbsp; The California State Assembly has
recently endorsed legislation to make medicinal marijuana
available to patients with life-threatening illnesses. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">In an effort to determine whether inhaled marijuana is truly of
any potential benefit and, more important, to evaluate its safety
in people with AIDS, the Community Consortium designed a pilot
study.&nbsp; We thought it would be appropriate to conduct a
small study of the overall feasibility of investigating inhaled
marijuana use by such patients, before embarking on a full-scale
trial of its efficacy.&nbsp; The pilot-drug-evaluation staff at
the FDA provided valuable comments on the design of the
protocol.&nbsp; Pulmonary-function tests, lymphocyte-sub-group
analyses, and measurements of viral burden by the branched-DNA
technique were to be performed serially for safety.&nbsp; Body composition
was to be measured by state-of-the-art techniques to assess potential
trends in the amelioration of wasting. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The FDA and the institutional review board supported the
study.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the DEA and the NIDA opposed
it.&nbsp; Most disturbing was the absence of a response from
either agency for an unacceptably long period, followed by the
NIDA's outright rejection of the proposal without any opportunity
for dialogue or compromise.&nbsp; Such behavior is offensive not
only to the investigators but to the patients for whom we seek to
find safe and effective treatments.</font> </p>

<HR>
<CENTER>QUESTIONS PRESENTED FOR REVIEW</CENTER>
<P>
1. Whether a State Court may rule that a Sanction (Driver's License Suspension) passed under a "Crimes Code" is merely a "collateral civil consequence" or an "additional civil penalty," thereby depriving a Defendant of his 5th Amendment Constitutional Rights, by being given the cruel and unusual punishment of being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense, and being deprived of his liberty and property without Due Process of Law.
<P>
2. Whether a State may deny Due Process of Law to a Defendant who has executed a plea bargain, by later demanding additional Penalties (Driver's License Suspension and over $10,000 in costs) which were not disclosed to the Defendant at the time of the court colloquy on the plea bargain agreement.
<P>
3. Whether a Defendant is denied Due Process of Law by being required to present his entire case within less than five minutes.  (Defendant's entire Defense case is on pages 5 to 10 of the Lower Court Transcript.)
<P>
4. Whether a State may deprive a Defendant of his Liberty and inflict Cruel and Unusual Punishment (Driver's License Suspension) for a Defendant's justifiable use (Medical Necessity) of a controlled substance (Cannabis) which had nothing to do with an automobile or the State Motor Vehicle Code, and whether Due Process demands that the defense of "justification" be available at all proceedings that are derived from the original criminal conviction.
<P>
5. Whether a State may refuse to issue an "Occupational Limited License" thereby denying the fundamental right of Liberty to a Defendant who is in a "suspect class" of "Medical Necessity Users of a Controlled Substance," who's actions are "Justified" under Common Law, the Pennsylvania State Law and section 503 of the Model Penal Code, and whether Due Process demands that the "justification" defense be available at all proceedings that are derived from the original conviction.

<FONT SIZE=4><CENTER>PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI</CENTER></FONT>
<HR><P>

Petitioner, JOHN M. GRUBOR, J.D. respectfully requests that a Writ of Certiorari issue to review the Judgment and Order of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denying Petitioner's Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal from the Judgment and Order of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.<P>

<CENTER>1</CENTER><HR>

<CENTER>OPINIONS BELOW</CENTER><P>

On November 4, 1993, after a five minute hearing, the Trial Court upheld the
suspension of Petitioner's Driver's license for an offense that had nothing to do with the Motor Vehicle Code. The Opinion of the Trial Court is attached to this Petition in the appendix, infra, and labeled as "Exhibit B." The Petitioner filed a timely appeal to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. The Opinion and Order of the Commonwealth Court are also in the appendix and labeled Exhibits "D" and "E," respectively. The Order of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, denying a review of the Commonwealth Court decision, is also attached in the appendix and labeled as "Exhibit F."<P>

<CENTER>JURISDICTION</CENTER><P>

The Petitioner filed a timely Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and on July 18, 1995, the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court denied Petitioner's Petition. The jurisdiction of this Honorable Supreme Court of the United States to review the final order of a State Supreme Court is vested in Title 28 UNITED STATES CODE Section 1257 and United States Supreme Court Rule 13. Thereby, Petitioner has 90 days from the State Supreme Court's Decision date within which to file a Petition for Certiorari.<P>

<CENTER>CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AND STATUTES INVOLVED</CENTER><P>

There are two Constitutional Provisions involved in the instant case. They are:<P>

"United States Constitution, Amendment V<BR>
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in<P>

<CENTER>2</CENTER><HR>

the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," and,<P>

"United States Constitution, Amendment VIII<BR>
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."<P>

There are two statutes involved in the instant case. The Primary Statute is the Pennsylvania State Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. section 780-113(m) which mandated a driver's license suspension for any conviction under the State Controlled Substance Act, the verbatim text of which is set forth in the Appendix, and marked as "Exhibit G."<P>

The Secondary Statute involved is of the Pennsylvania State Motor Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. Section 1553, which excludes the Petitioner from eligibility for the issuance of an "Occupational limited license," the verbatim text of which is set forth in the Appendix, and marked as "Exhibit H."<P>

<CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER><P>

This Case involves the bona fide medical use of a controlled substance
(Cannabis) for a "life or death" medical necessity. In January of 1982, Petitioner had an auto accident in which he received a severe impact injury to his head. Thereafter, Petitioner began having bloody nocturnal epileptic seizures. For almost five years, Petitioner was treated with Dilantin and other prescription drugs by three different Neurologists, but none of the Physicians or prescription drugs were able to stop the Petitioner's bloody seizures. Because of the<P>

<CENTER>3</CENTER><HR>

nocturnal seizures, Petitioner was in fear of his death for two reasons. The first was the possibility of ending a seizure on his back and thereby suffocating on the "swallowing of the tongue" effect. But he was also fearing death from "drowning in his own blood." On many a morning, Petitioner woke up with blood all over his pillow and sheets. His tongue was severely bitten into on both sides and the taste of blood would last for days. Sometime it would take weeks for the tongue to heal and the pain resulting from the back spasms during the seizures would last for months. In 1986, Petitioner read a book by a Harvard Physician, Dr. Lester Grinspoon, and the medical literature indicated that Cannabis was the only known substance to actually stop epileptic seizures from occurring.<P>

Because Petitioner had "no legal alternative," he began using Cannabis for his life threatening medical necessity in late 1986, and he has had no seizures ever since. In the spring of 1991, Petitioner was charged with the possession of 1/3 ounce the controlled substance Cannabis, and in March of 1992, Petitioner plead guilty to "possession" of Cannabis. The trial court was aware of the Petitioner's claim of a "medical necessity," and a plea bargain of "one year probation with NO other penalty" was agreed to by the parties. Neither during the plea bargain discussions with the Prosecution nor during the Trial Court Colloquy on the guilty plea was there ever any discussion of any "additional penalty" of a driver's license suspension, and the Petitioner was not aware of any "additional penalty." If Petitioner had been aware of an "additional penalty" at the time of the plea, he would not have entered into the plea bargain agreement with the Prosecutor.<P>

In April 1992, when the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's Bureau of Driver Licensing tried to suspend Petitioner's Driver's License, Petitioner filed a Statutory Appeal and was then scheduled for a <I>de novo</I> hearing on November 4, 1992. Before beginning the hearing, Petitioner was told by the Court "tipstaff" that he would be allowed only FIVE minutes to present his entire defense case to the trial court, and because of that pre-set limitation, Petitioner was not able to
call any other witnesses to testify but himself. Petitioner's defense began on page five of the hearing transcript. (See "Exhibit A" for the relevant sections of<P>

<CENTER>4</CENTER><HR>

the trial transcript.) Although Petitioner had five separate arguments to present, for the convenience of the Trial Court he told the Judge (page 6 of the transcript) that he would "get them in in five minutes." Only three minutes later, (at page 9 of the Transcript) the Judge said to the Petitioner: "Finish up, please." Petitioner's entire defense is contained in pages 5 to 10 of the trial transcript which is attached in the Appendix to this Petition and marked as "Exhibit A."<P>

Petitioner thereafter filed a timely appeal to the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania, and on October 28, 1994, the Commonwealth Court rendered an
opinion on Petitioner's appeal, hereafter attached in the appendix to this Petition and marked as "Exhibit D." Thereafter, Petitioner filed a timely petition for reconsideration, which was denied. Finally, Petitioner filed an Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania which was denied on July 18, 1995. This Certiorari Petition now requests a review of that Order.<P>

<CENTER>REASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT</CENTER><P>

Under Rule 10 of the U.S. Supreme Court rules, there are stated three main
"characters of compelling reasons" which are considered by this Honorable
Supreme Court of the United States when considering review on a Writ of
Certiorari. Both the second and the third "characters of compelling reasons" are applicable to the instant case, and the third character is twice applicable.<P>

FIRST REASON FOR GRANTING THE WRIT:<BR>
STATE vs. STATE CONFLICT.<P>

The second character of "compelling reason" stated in Rule 10 is when:<BR>
"A state court of last resort has decided a federal question in a way that conflicts with the decision of another state court of last resort or of a United States Court of appeals;" That is exactly what has occurred in the instant case. Because of some 1989 Federal mandates to the States (updated Code found at Title 23 U.S.C. section 159), all 50 of the United States have been mandated to pass<P>

<CENTER>5</CENTER><HR>

some kind of "smoke a joint, lose your license" law to keep their share of
Federal Highway funds. The 50 different states have responded in scores of different ways (See Marijuana Policy Project Article at Exhibit K) and over 31 states have "opted-out" by legislative vote, and have decided to forego Federal Highway funds in amounts of up to $100 million dollars a year. (See 1995 California "Smoke a Joint, Lose your License Law" in Appendix as "Exhibit J) This option by the California Legislature creates a great indication of the "peoples' view" of these license suspension regulations' constitutionality or fairness, and the Courts of the States are just as divided.<P>

At the present time, only 18 States have opted to continue to follow this Federal mandate (See MPP Article, Exhibit K) and in the States that have, the States' Supreme Courts have been just as divided when rendering opinions directly opposite to other State Courts. The crux of the matter at issue in the instant case is whether Petitioner's driver's license suspension, as mandated by the Pennsylvania State Crimes Code, is actually a "criminal penalty" or a "collateral civil consequence" from which he is entitled to no constitutional protections. In the case at bar, the highest State Court of Pennsylvania has held the later, thus denying the Petitioner his constitutional rights in the instant driver's license suspension case. See <I>Duffey v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing,</I> 639 A.2d 1174 (1994). But other State Courts have held that this type of driver's license suspension was a "criminal penalty" and therefore any proceedings must be subjected to all Constitutional rights protections. See the very recent IOWA Supreme Court Decision in <I><a href="../NORML/LAWS/hills.html">WANDA JOY HILLS vs. IOWA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND MOTOR VEHICLE DIVISION</A></I> at No. 111/94-453 (Filed July 14, 1995 -- slip opinion not yet published.)<P>

The third "compelling reason" stated in U.S. Supreme Court Rule 10 is when:<BR>
"A state court ... has decided an important question of federal law that has not been, but should be, settled by this Court, OR has decided a federal question in a way that conflicts with applicable decisions of this Court." BOTH are true in the case at bar.<P>

<CENTER>6</CENTER><HR>

SECOND REASON FOR GRANTING THE WRIT:<BR>
STATE COURTS DECIDE IMPORTANT QUESTION OF<BR>
FEDERAL LAW THAT SHOULD BE SETTLED BY THIS COURT.<P>

Initially, the very important decision of federal law, concerning the
"constitutional rights applicability" to "federally mandated driver's license suspensions," has never been considered or decided by this Honorable Supreme Court of the United States. This may well be a 10th Amendment issue in all 50 States that sorely needs to be addressed and decided as quickly as possible. The backlog of criminal cases that this Federal driver's license mandate has created is a major national problem (See MPP article at Exhibit K) and it has all been caused by the Federal Statute at Title 23 U.S.C. Section 159, the constitutionality of which Statute has never been decided by this Honorable Court. However, that does not preclude this Honorable Supreme Court of the United States from taking plenary jurisdiction <I>ab initio.</I><P>

THIRD REASON FOR GRANTING THE WRIT:<BR>
STATE SUPREME COURT DECIDES A QUESTION OF FEDERAL LAW IN A WAY<BR>
THAT CONFLICTS WITH APPLICABLE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT<BR>
DECISIONS.<P>

The second half of the U.S. Supreme Court's Rule 10 "third compelling reason
criteria" is the most applicable in the instant case, because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decisions in <I>Duffey v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing,</I> 536 Pa. 436, 639 A.2d 1174, <I>cert. denied (pre Kurth Ranch),</I> 513 U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 223, 130 L.Ed.2d 149 (1994) and <I>Plowman v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing,</I> 535 Pa. 314, 635 A.2d 124 (1993) (1994) (which were cited by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in deciding the instant case -- See opinion in Appendix as Exhibit D) are in DIRECT conflict with the recent United States Supreme Court decisions in <I>United States v. Halper,</I> 490 U.S. 435, 104 L.Ed 2d 487, 109 S.Ct. 1892 (1989) and <I>Montana v. Kurth Ranch,</I> ___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 1937 (1994).<P>

The recent Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court case of <I>Wylie v Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver's Licensing,</I> 638 A.2d 433 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1994) points out the major problem in the case at bar, and a reading of that Court's opinion and it's following of the <I>Plowman</I> case, id, points out the gross conflict between the Pennsylvania Case Law in <I>Plowman</I> and this Honorable United States Supreme Court's controlling Federal Law decision rendered in <I>U.S. v  Halper,</I> id. In <I>Wylie,</I> id, at pg. 435, when considering the "primary statute at issue" in the instant case, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court Held:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The due process constitutional challenge raised by Wylie is controlled by<BR>
our Supreme Court's recent decision in <I>Plowman,</I> id.... -- the Supreme<BR>
Court held that the DETERRENCE of illegal drug use was a legitimate<BR>
state interest, and Section 13(m) was reasonably related to that end."<BR>
(Emphasis supplied)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

From this we get the purpose of the "primary statute at issue" in the instant case, which was determined to be "deterrence," and indeed, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania states in the <I>Plowman,</I> id, Opinion at pg. 127:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"the maximum PENALTY for the criminal violation of possession of<BR>
marijuana is 30 days of imprisonment and/or a $500 fine. It is doubtful<BR>
that such a PENALTY would be imposed for a first-time offense. In fact,<BR>
a first offense may merit nothing more than a small fine. As such, the<BR>
prospect of losing one's driver's license may DETER a potential drug user<BR>
from committing that first drug offense. At least, that potential user may<BR>
consider the loss of his/her license and it's effect on employment..."<BR>
(emphasis supplied)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

From this <I>Plowman</I> holding, it seems clear that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considers the primary statute at issue herein, 13(m), to have a legitimate state interest for the purpose of DETERRING the illegal use of drugs in Pennsylvania. But is the Pennsylvania <I>Plowman</I> case "good law" when tested by this Honorable Court's decision in <I>Halper,</I> id? The answer is a resounding NO! According to this Honorable United States Supreme Court, if the sanction is characterized as a "deterrent," it must be considered a double-jeopardy violation of due-process.<P>

<CENTER>8</CENTER><HR>

In <I>Halper v. United States,</I> at 490 US 435, 448 (1989), this Honorable Supreme Court of the United States held that:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"... the determination whether a given civil sanction constitutes<BR>
punishment in the relevant sense requires a particularized assessment of<BR>
the penalty imposed and the purposes that the penalty may fairly be said<BR>
to serve. Simply put, a civil as well as a criminal sanction constitutes<BR>
punishment when the sanction applied in the individual case serves<BR>
the goals of punishment."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

And finally, in <I>Halper,</I> id, at pgs. 448-449, this Honorable Supreme Court states:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"a defendant who has already been punished in a criminal prosecution<BR>
may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the<BR>
second sanction may not be fairly characterized as remedial, but only as a<BR>
DETERRENT or retribution." (emphasis supplied)</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

The Pennsylvania Court in <I>Plowman</I> held that the purpose of the "primary statute at issue" in the instant case was "deterrence," and this Honorable United States Supreme Court held in <I>Halper</I> that if the purpose or characterization of a sanction was a "deterrent," that the defendant may not be subjected to the sanction. The Pennsylvania <I>Plowman</I> case, by which the decision in the instant case was supported, is in DIRECT conflict with this Honorable Court's ruling in
the <I>Halper,</I> id, and thereby creates some very valid grounds for the granting of the Writ of Certiorari to the Petitioner in the case at bar.<P>

In the lower court, Petitioner argued that his 90-day suspension in this case was a violation of due-process, because it took away his constitutional protections against equal protection denial and the cruel and unusual punishment of double jeopardy. Indeed the Commonwealth Court understood this very well when it stated that Petitioner asserted at the trial, "(1) that he was not advised that his driver's license would be suspended if he pleaded guilty," (a double-jeopardy assertion) and "(3) that the ninety-day suspension is cruel and unusual punishment and a violation of due process," (an assertion of both 5th and llth Amendment rights -- See pg. 3&4, Commonwealth Court Opinion, Exhibit D, Appendix.) Double Jeopardy is indeed a kind of "cruel and unusual punishment," and all of these issues were raised at the trial court in a "three minute rush"<P>

<CENTER>9</CENTER><HR>

defense, and they were preserved for appeal by that proceeding, as well as could be expected given the restrictions imposed by the trial court. The five issues that were preserved for review in both the trial and appellate courts were:<P>

1. Whether a State may rule that a Sanction (Driver's License Suspension)
passed under a "Crimes Code" is merely a "collateral civil consequence" or an "additional civil penalty," thereby depriving a Defendant of his 5th Amendment Constitutional Rights, by being given the cruel and unusual punishment of being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense, and being deprived of his liberty and property without Due Process of Law.<P>

2. Whether a State may deny Due Process of Law to a Defendant who has
executed a plea bargain, by later demanding additional Penalties (Driver's
License Suspension and over $10,000 in costs) which were not disclosed to the Defendant at the time of the court colloquy on the plea bargain agreement.<P>

3. Whether a Defendant is denied Due Process of Law by being required to
present his entire case within less than five minutes. (Defendant's entire
Defense case is on pages 5 to 10 of the Lower Court Transcript.)<P>

4. Whether a State may deprive a Defendant of his Liberty and inflict Cruel and Unusual Punishment (Driver's License Suspension) for a Defendant's justifiable use (Medical Necessity) of a controlled substance (Cannabis) which had nothing to do with an automobile or the State Motor Vehicle Code, and whether Due Process demands that the defense of "justification" be available at all proceedings that are derived from the original criminal conviction.<P>

5. Whether a State may refuse to issue an "Occupational Limited License"
thereby denying the fundamental right of Liberty to a Defendant who is in a
"suspect class" of "Medical Necessity Users of a Controlled Substance," who's actions are "Justified" under Common Law, the State Pennsylvania Law and section 503 of the Model Penal Code, and whether Due Process demands that<P>

<CENTER>10</CENTER><HR>

the "justification" defense be available at all proceedings that are derived from the original conviction.<P>

All of these issues were presented to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, and a copy of the above five issues, in proposed Certiorari form, was attached to Petitioner's Allocatur Petition for Allowance of Appeal. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court's finding that Petitioner's Driver's license was a "collateral civil consequence" or a "civil consequence of a criminal violation" is very hard to justify, when one examines the source of the sanction, which was the Pennsylvania "Crimes Code." In addition, the <I>Plowman</I> decision, upon which the
Commonwealth Court relies, is in gross conflict with the <I>Halper</I> decision of this Honorable United States Supreme Court, and therefore it must be overruled.<P>

<CENTER>CONCLUSION</CENTER><P>

This is a very valid case of some State Law being in conflict with other State Law, and that alone is sufficient reason for the granting of a Writ of Certiorari to Petitioner. However, it is clear from a reading of the Pennsylvania case law that the decisions of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court are in direct conflict with this Honorable Court's <I>Halper</I> decision, and therefore a writ of Certiorari to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is Petitioner's only effective remedy.<P>

WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays to this Honorable Supreme Court of
the United States to issue a Writ of Certiorari to review the Judgment and Order of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, and the Judgment and Order of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.<P>

Respectfully submitted,<P>

<P><B>9513:&nbsp;  Access to Therapeutic Marijuana/Cannabis</B> 
 
<P>The American Public Health Association, 
<DD>Being aware that cannabis/marijuana has been used medicinally 
for centuries and that cannabis products were widely prescribed 
by physicians in the United States until 1937;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Being aware that "marijuana" prohibition began with the 
Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 under false claims despite disagreeing 
testimony from the AMA's representative;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#3">3</a>,<a href="#4">4</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Being further aware that the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 
completely prohibited all medicinal use of marijuana by placing 
it in the most restrictive category of Schedule I, whereby drugs 
must meet three criteria for placement in this category: 1) have 
no therapeutic value, 2) are not safe for medical use, and 3) 
have a high abuse potential;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#5">5</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Being cognizant that the Drug Enforcement Administration's own 
administrative law judge ruled in 1988 that marijuana must be 
removed from Schedule I and made available for physicians to 
prescribe;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#6">6-8</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Knowing that 36 states have passed legislation recognizing 
marijuana's therapeutic value;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#9">9</a>,<a href="#10">10</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Also knowing that the only available access to legal marijuana 
which was through the Food and Drug Administration's 
Investigational New Drug Program has been closed by the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services since 1992;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#11">11</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Understanding that while synthetic Tetrahydrocannibinol (THC) 
is available in pill form, it is only one of approximately 60 
cannabinoids which may have medicinal value individually or in 
some combination; and 
<DD>Understanding that marijuana has an extremely wide acute 
margin of safety for use under medical supervision and cannot 
cause lethal reactions;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#6">6</a>,<a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#34">34</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Understanding that marijuana has been reported to be effective 
in: a) reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#12">12</a>,<a href="#13">13</a></SMALL></SUP> b) 
reducing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#14">14-16</a></SMALL></SUP> 
c) stimulating the appetite for patients living with AIDS 
(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and suffering from the 
wasting syndrome;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#17">17-19</a></SMALL></SUP> d) controlling spasticity associated with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#20">20-25</a></SMALL></SUP> e) decreasing the suffering from chronic pain;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#26">26-28</a></SMALL></SUP> and f) controlling seizures associated with seizure disorders;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#29">29-31</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Understanding that marijuana seems to work differently than 
many conventional medications for the above problems, making it a 
possible option for persons resistant to the conventional 
medications;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#32">32</a>,<a href="#33">33</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Being concerned that desperate patients and their families are 
choosing to break the law to obtain this medicine when conventional medicines or treatments have not been effective for them or are too toxic;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#34">34</a>,<a href="#35">35</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Realizing that this places ill persons at risk for criminal 
charges and at risk for obtaining contaminated medicine because 
of the lack of quality control; and 
<DD>Realizing that thousands of patients not helped by conventional medications and treatments, may find relief from their suffering with the use of marijuana if their primary care providers were able to prescribe this medicine; and 
<DD>Concluding that cannabis/marijuana was wrongfully placed in 
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances depriving patients of its 
therapeutic potential; 
<DD>Recognizing that APHA adopted a resolution (7014) on Marijuana 
and the Law which urged federal and state drugs laws to exclude 
marijuana from classification as a narcotic drug;<SUP><SMALL><a href="#36">36</a></SMALL></SUP> and 
<DD>Concluding that greater harm is caused by the legal 
consequences of its prohibition than possible risks of medicinal 
use; therefore 
<DD>1.&nbsp;  Encourages research of the therapeutic properties of 
various cannabinoids and combinations of cannabinoids; and 
<DD>2.&nbsp;  Encourages research on alternative methods of 
administration to decrease the harmfull effects related to 
smoking; and 
<DD>3.&nbsp;  Urges the Administration and Congress to move 
expeditiously to make cannabis available as a legal medicine 
where shown to be safe and effective and to immediately allow 
access to therapeutic cannibis through the Investigational New 
Drug Program.

export needs of the United States.  The Secretary shall de-
termine the total quantity of marihuana to be produced 
each calendar year to provide for the estimated medical, 
scientific, and research needs of the United States, for the 
establishment of reserve stocks, and for any lawful export 
requirements established by the Attorney General under 
section 1003.  Based on the determination under the pre-
ceding sentence, the Secretary shall recommend to the At-
torney General the aggregate production quotas that must 
be established for marihuana under section 306(a).  The 
recommendation of the Secretary concerning the aggregate 
production quotas for marihuana shall be binding on the 
Attorney General.

     &quot;(b)(1) In order to maintain an adequate supply of 
marihuana, the Secretary shall periodically publish notices 
soliciting bids on a contract or contracts for the domestic 
cultivation and delivery of marihuana.  All bids submitted 
must specify the areas in which, and the land on which, 
cultivation of marihuana will be conducted.  All bids sub-
mitted must be accompanied by an application for reg-
istration under section 302.

     &quot;(2) The Secretary shall forward a copy of the reg-
istration application to the Attorney General.  The Sec-
retary, after consultation with the Attorney General, shall 
recommend to the Attorney General that the application 
for registration be granted or denied, taking into account 
the factors set forth in section 303(a).  The recommenda-
tions of the Secretary concerning the registration of appli-
cants to produce marihuana shall be binding on the Attor-
ney General.

     &quot;(3) The Secretary may accept of reject any bid that 
is submitted by registered bidders, taking into consider-
ation (A) the factors set forth in section 303(a), and (B) 
price.  Marihuana may be produced only by accepted bid-
ders, solely on the land specified in the applicants' bids.  
The Secretary shall provide persons whose bids have been 
accepted with marihuana seeds capable of germination.  
Such seeds shall be obtained by the Secretary from legiti-
mate commercial producers of marihuana or, if this is not 
feasible, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the Attor-
ney General through the Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion, or the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide the Sec-
retary with an adequate supply of seeds capable of germi-
nation.

     &quot;(c) Upon acceptance of a bid for the production of 
marihuana, the Secretary shall establish an individual 
quota for the production of marihuana for the bidder and 
shall recommend to the Attorney General that this quota 
be assigned to the bidder where required under section 
306.  The recommendations of the Secretary concerning in-
dividual quotas for the production of marihuana, including 
recommendations that such a quota be decreased or in-
creased, shall be binding on the Attorney General.

     &quot;(d) The Secretary may revoke or suspend the ac-
ceptance of any bid for the production of marihuana prior 
to the expiration of the contract executed on the basis of 
the bid upon a finding by the Secretary (1) that the bidder 
has materially breached the terms of the contract relating 
to the maintenance of effective controls against diversion 
of marihuana into other than legitimate medical, scientific, 
and industrial channels; or (2) that any of the reasons 
specified in section 304(a) are applicable.  Upon such rev-
ocation or suspension, the Secretary shall recommend to 
the Attorney General that the bidder's registration for the 
production of marihuana be revoked or suspended pursu-
ant to section 304 and such recommendatios by the Sec-
retary shall be binding on the Attorney General.

     &quot;(e) Within four months of the end of the harvest 
of marihuana grown by registered bidders pursuant to 
contract with the Office, the Office or its delegate or dele-
gates shall take physical possession of the marihuana har-
vested.

     &quot;(f)(1) The Secretary may, at his discretion, periodi-
cally publish notices soliciting bids on a contract of con-
tracts for the physical collection, processing, and shipping 
of marihuana crops produced under contracts entered into 
under subsection (b) or of imported or forfeited stocks de-
scribed in subsections (g) and (h).  All bids submitted must 
be accompanied by an application for registration under 
section 302.

     &quot;(2) The Secretary shall forward a copy of the reg-
istration application to the Attorney General.  The Sec-
retary, after consultation with the Attorney General, shall 
recommend to the Attorney General that the application 
for registration be granted or denied, taking into account 
the factors set forth in section 303(b) and such rec-
ommendatios of the Secretary shall be binding on the At-
ttorney General.

     &quot;(3) The Secretary may accept or reject any bids sub-
mitted by registered bidders, taking into consideration (A) 
the factors set forth in section 303(b); (B) the provisions 
in the bid for the processing of raw marihuana into medi-
cally usable forms, including the provisions for the mainte-
nance of controlled amounts of tetrahydrocannabinols in 
each dosage unit; and (C) price.

     &quot;(g) If a supply of marihuana adequate to meet do-
mestic medical, scientific, and research needs is not ob-
tained through contractual arrangements with domestic 
registered bidders, the Secretary shall declare that a state 
of emergency exists.  The declaration by the Secretary of 
a state of emergency due to inadequate domestic supplies 
of marihuana shall have the same effect as a finding by 
the Attorney General of an emergency due to inadequate 
domestic supplies under section 1002(a)(2)(A).  If no ap-
plicants are registered to import marihuana under sections 
1007 and 1008 within sixty days of the date of the dec-
laration by the Secretary that a state of emergency exists, 
the Secretary shall make arrangements for the direct im-
portation by the Office of a supply of marihuana adequate 
for domestic medical, scientific, and research needs.

     &quot;(h) If, while a state of emergency declared under 
subsection (g) exists, the Secretary finds that a supply of 
marihuana adequate for domestic medical, scientific, and 
research needs cannot be obtained through importation, 
then the Secretary may request that the Attorney General 
forward to the Office forfeited stocks of marihuana that 
are unadulterated with other substances, pursuant to sec-
tion 511(e).

     &quot;DISTRIBUTION OF MEDICINAL MARIHUANA

     &quot;SEC. 313.  (a) Marihuana shall be distributed only 
to hospitals and pharmacies that are --

          &quot;(1) registered under section 303(f) to dispense 
     drugs in schedule II of section 202; and

          &quot;(2) specified by (A) an eligible physician who 
     plans to use marihuana in the treatment of the nau-
     sea of patients who are undergoing cancer chemo-
     therapy or radiology or in the treatment of patients 
     who have glaucoma, AIDS wasting syndrome, or 
     muscle spasms from certain spastic disorders, in-
     cluding multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriple-
     gia; or (B) a person who has obtained approval by 
     the Secretary of an investigational new drug applica-
     tion under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
     and Cosmetic Act for research involving the use of 
     marihuana.

     &quot;(b) In order to be certified as a physician eligible 
for purposes of subsection (a)(2)(A), the physician must 
file a written application with the Office seeking permis-
sion to use marihuana in his practice.  Such an application 
shall be approved or denied within thirty days of its receipt 
by the Office, or, where possible, within such shorter time 
as is deemed essential by the applicant in cases of medical 
emergency.  If an application is not acted upon within thir-
ty days of its receipt by the Office, it shall be deemed 
approved.  To be approved an application must affirma-
tively state (1) that the applicant is a physician registered 
under section 303(f) to dispense controlled drugs in sched-
ule II of section 202; (2) the applicants's registration num-
ber; (3) that the applicant will use the requested mari-
huana solely for the treatment of glaucoma, AIDS wasting 
syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic disorders, 
including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, 
or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy or ra-
diology; (4) the name of all pharmacies or hospitals reg-
istered to dispense schedule II drugs that the applicant 
is requesting that supplies of marihuana be sent to; (5) 
that the applicant will inform the Office of any adverse 
reactions by his patients to the use of marihuana; and (6) 
that prior to administratio of marihuana to any patient, 
he will obtain from the patient a signed consent form stat-
ing that informed patient consent has been obtained.  Un-
less the Secretary determines that an application which 
makes the statements required by the preceding sentence 
contains a misstatement of fact, the application shall be 
approved upon payment of a reasonable fee to cover the 
costs of processing the application.  Approval of the phys-
cian's application may be suspended or revoked by the 
Secretary for good cause shown.

     &quot;(c)(1) Upon certification of a physician as eligible 
under subsection (b), the Secretary shall issue serially 
numbered marihuana oder forms to all registered phar-
macies or hospitals listed on the eligible physician's appli-
cation form.  Whenever any such form is issued to a phar-
macy or hospital the Secretary shall, before delivery there-
of, insert therein the name of the pharmacy or hospital, 
and it shall be unlawful for any other person (A) to use 
such form for the purpose of obtaining controlled sub-
stances; or (B) to furnish such form to any person with 
intent thereby to procure the distribution of such sun-
stances.

     &quot;(2) It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain by 
means of order forms issued under this subsection con-
trolled substances for any purpose other than their use, 
distribution, dispensing, or administration in the conduct 
of a lawful business in such substances or in the course 
or his professional practice or research.

     &quot;(3) Written orders made on marihuana order forms 
issued under this subsection shall satisfy the requirements 
of section 308(a).

     &quot;(4) The preservation and availability requirements 
of section 308(c) apply to orders made on forms issued 
under this subsection.

     &quot;(d) Hospitals and pharmacies may obtain supplies 
of marihuana only by forwarding a written order to the 
Secretary on the form issued in blank in accordance with 
subsection (c).  Upon receipt from a hospital or pharmacy 
of a properly completed marihuana order form requesting 
a supply of marihuana the Office or its delegate or dele-
gates shall forward a supply of marihuana to the phar-
macy or hospital within a reasonable time.  If notified by 
an eligible physician that there is a medical urgency for 
immediate shipment, the Office or its delegate or delegates 
shall forward a supply of marihuana within five days of 
such notice, or sooner if feasible.  Also, upon receipt by 
the Secretary of a written request of a person who has 
obtained approval of an investigational new drug applica-
tion under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act for research involving the use of marihuana, 
the Office or its delegate or delegates shall forward a sup-
ply of marihuana to the specified pharmacy or hospital 
licensed to dispense schedule II drugs within a reasonable 
time.

     &quot;(e) The Secretary is directed to set a price for mari-
huana that will recoup, within a reasonable time, all of 
the costs incurred by the Federal Government in produc-
ing, processing, and distributing marihuana.

     &quot;(f) Within six months from the date of the enact-
ment of this section, the Secretary, after consultation with 
the Attorney General, shall promulgate regulations con-
sistent with public health and safety that are in accord 
with the provisions of this title to ensure adequate sup-
ply of medically usable marihuana and to ensure proper 
safeguards regarding the production, storage, processing,
distribution, and dispensing of marihuana so as to prevent 
its diversion into other than legitimate medical, scientific, 
or research channels.&quot;.

     (c) Penalty. -- Section 402(a) of the Controlled Sub-
stances Act is amended (1) by striking out &quot;or&quot; at the 
end of paragraph (9), (2) by stiking out the period at 
the end of paragraph (10) and inserting in lieu thereof 
&quot;; or&quot;, and (3) by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph:

          &quot;(11) to use an oder form issued under section 
     313(c) in a manner prohibited by such section or to 
     furnish such a form in violation of such section.&quot;.

SEC. 4.  COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG,
          AND COSMETIC ACT.

     The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amend-
ed by inserting after section 505 the following:

     &quot;THERAPEUTIC USE OF MARIHUANA

     &quot;SEC. 505A.  (a) Nothwithstanding section 505(a), the 
approval of the Secretary shall not be required for the in-
troduction or delivery of marihuana into interstate com-
merce in compliance with the requirements of sections 312 
and 313 of the Controlled Substances Act.

     &quot;(b) Marihuana is defined as a prescription drug for 
purposes of section 503(b).  Only physicians who are eligi-
ble to obtain marihuana under section 313(b) of the Con-
trolled Substances Act may issue written prescriptions au-
thorizing the dispensing or marihuana under section 
503(b).&quot;.

SEC. 5.  AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

     There is authorized to be appropriated not to exceed 
$5,000,000 for the fiscal year 1996, and $5,000,000 for 
the fiscal year 1997, for the use of the Office for the Sup-
ply of Internationally Controlled Drugs in conducting, 
contracting for, supervising, and administering the pro-
duction, testing, processing, distribution, and dispensing 
of marihuana.

SEC. 6.  INTERIM PROVISIONS.

     The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
procure a supply of marihuana adequate for the scientific, 
medical, and research needs of the United States within 
12 months after the date of the enactment of this Act.  
The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the At-
torney General shall ensure that persons now receiving 
marihuana pursuant to research projects approved by the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services continue to re-
ceive uninterrupted supplies until the system for the proc-
essing and distribution of marihuana produced pursuant 
to the Controlled Substances Act is fully operational.

<P>EDITORIAL 
 
<P><B>Deglamorising cannabis</B> 
 
<DD>The smoking of cannabis, even long term, is not harmful to health.&nbsp;  Yet this widely used substance is illegal just about everywhere.&nbsp;  There have been numerous calls over the years for the legalisation, or at least decriminalisation, of soft drugs, among which cannabis remains the most popular with all social groups.&nbsp;  In this highly contentious area, the Dutch attitude has been often mentioned as the voice of sanity.&nbsp;  In the Netherlands, customers of coffee shops can buy up to 30 g of cannabis for about 10 pounds ($15) although the drug is technically illegal.&nbsp;  The shops are not allowed to advertise, or to sell cannabis to individuals aged under 16 years. 
 
<DD>Prominent among those currently calling for legislative reform - and going further by making constructive proposals - are police chiefs and city medical officers, people who know only too well that the existing policies in most countries are ineffective and unworkable.&nbsp;  Meanwhile, politicians have largely remained silent, seemingly afraid of offending powerful segments of the electorate or merely of being perceived as weak in the face of rising crime figures.&nbsp;  When the occasional politician raises her head above the parapet - as the British opposition MP Clare Short did recently in calling for a fresh debate on decriminalisation of cannabis - the response is tediously predictable: widespread condemnation from political colleagues and overwhelming support from those who have to cope with the end result of political inertia. 
 
<DD>In the case of Ms Short, not only was she speedily reprimanded by the party leader, but also party officials claimed that their non-legalisation stance was entirely logical since legalisation of cannabis would "increase the supply, reduce the price, and increase the usage".&nbsp;  According to a Home Office report earlier this year, the number of people taking cannabis 
has doubled in a decade - without any help from "liberal" measures.&nbsp;  Perhaps the politicians' real fear was that freedom to use soft drugs would automatically progress to increased use of substances such as cocaine and heroin.&nbsp;  If so, they must have overlooked the recent Dutch government review which pointed out that decriminalisation of possession of soft drugs has not led to a rise in the use of hard drugs. 
 
<DD>If the Dutch approach is so successful, why are changes afoot in The Hague to tighten up that country's drug policy?&nbsp;  First Amsterdam's mayor proposed closing down half the city's coffee shops that sell cannabis, and in doing so he rejected a report by his health department in favour of legalisation of soft drugs.&nbsp;  Then the Dutch government, which had made an election promise to legalise cannabis, last month issued a discussion 
paper which mirrored the Amsterdam plan.&nbsp;  If, as expected, the Dutch parliament agrees the latest proposals, half the country's 4000 cannabis-selling coffee shops will close and the amount that can be sold to an individual will be cut to 5 g.&nbsp;  Since the government's own review provides no ammunition for such a change in policy, the real reason behind the new measures must lie elsewhere.&nbsp;  One need look no further than the Netherlands' neighbours and co-signatories of the Schengen agreement, which introduced a border-free zone between the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, and Belgium.&nbsp;  When France, in particular, threatened to end the agreement, claiming that the Netherlands was the major supplier of Europe's drugs, some action had to be taken and the coffee shops became the scapegoat. 
 
<DD>Leaving politics aside, where is the harm in decriminalising cannabis?&nbsp;  There is none to the health of the consumers, and the criminal fraternity who depend for their succour on prohibition would hate it.&nbsp;  But decriminalisation of possession does not go far enough in our view.&nbsp;  That has to be accompanied by controls on source, distribution, and advertising, much as happens with tobacco.&nbsp;   A system, in fact, remarkably close to the existing one in Dutch coffee shops. 
 
<DD>Cannabis has become a political football, and one that governments continually duck.&nbsp;  Like footballs, however, it bounces back.&nbsp;  Sooner or later politicians will have to stop running scared and address the evidence: cannabis per se is not a hazard to society but driving it further underground may well be.

<p>THE BOSTON GLOBE * SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1995 * PAGE 13</p>

<p>Pot, a balm to some, faces a new hurdle</p>

<p>By Dolores Kong<br> 
GLOBE STAFF</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The treatment for the cancer spreading throughout David 
Getchell's body causes nausea and vomiting so severe that the 51-
year-old scientist can barely eat.&nbsp;  Only one drug helps: 
marijuana.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;It makes life more bearable, and you can hang on and fight,&quot; 
said Getchell, who worked as a pediatric chemist at Massachusetts 
General Hospital before he became too sick.&nbsp;  &quot;That's why I'm 
still alive.&quot;<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">But a bill to allow patients like Getchell to use medical 
necessity as a legal defense if they are arrested for possessing 
marijuana, passed early this month by the Legislature, has met 
unexpected resistance from Gov. Weld.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Weld has sent the bill back to the Legislature, requesting an 
amendment that would allow the legal defense only for certified 
participants in a Department of Public Health therapeutic 
research program - of which there are none.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The program, created by a 1991 law, has never enrolled anyone 
because the federal government has stopped providing a legal 
supply of medical marijuana, although the state has renewed 
efforts to get federal approval for supplying marijuana to 
patients.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Weld said in an interview that &quot;unlike others, I do think that 
there's some evidence that marijuana has some value for treating 
some medical conditions,&quot; such as glaucoma, AIDS wasting 
syndrome, or the side effects of chemotherapy.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;I just think the bill is just too wide open.  The self-
diagnosis approach is too wide open,&quot; he said.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Getchell, a fair-skinned redhead diagnosed in 1990 with 
melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer that resulted from severe 
sunburn when he was an adolescent, fought hard to get the bill 
passed.&nbsp;  He said he cannot understand Weld's action, pointing out 
that in 1992, the governor commuted the sentence of Joseph 
Hutchins, who was growing and using marijuana so that he could 
eat despite scleroderma, an incurable disease that hardened his 
esophagus and made it extremely hard to swallow.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;What I would want to say to Gov. Weld is that this is an 
issue of compassion,&quot; Getchell said.&nbsp;  &quot;It's not about winning or 
not winning the drug war.&nbsp;  It's about sick and dying people and a 
way to help them under medical supervision.&quot;<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Rep. Patricia D. Jehlen (D-Somerville), the bill's sponsor and 
Getchell's state representative, said she did not understand 
Weld's action either, since legislators have all along 
incorporated suggestions on the wording from the governor's 
office.&nbsp;  &quot;All I know is that it doesn't make sense, given what he 
did with Hutchins,&quot; Jehlen said.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Hutchins has appealed his conviction, but the Supreme Judicial 
Court ruled in 1991 that he could not use a medical-necessity 
defense.&nbsp;  The Legislature pased the current bill to recognize 
such a defense in Massachusetts, giving patients like Getchell 
the ability to bring up medical evidence in court, Jehlen said.&nbsp;  
She has filed an amendment that she believes would deal with 
Weld's concerns, but with this year's legislative session over, 
the bill will have to wait until January.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Hutchins now lives in Washington state, which recognizes the 
medical-necessity defense, according to Jon Holmes, a volunteer 
serving on the drug policy task force of the Civil Liberties 
Union of Massachusetts.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Weld said his thinking has not changed since he commuted 
Hutchins' sentence, but that the bill as passed does not have 
safeguards in place to ensure that only those with legitimate 
medical claims like Hutchins can use the medical-necessity 
defense.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;The bill I originally sent back didn't have the word 'doctor' 
anywhere near it,&quot; Weld said.&nbsp;  That suggests anyone arrested for 
marijuana possession would assert medical necessity &quot;in virtually 
every case,&quot; he said.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Opponents of the medical use of marijuana have argued that 
there are legal alternatives to treat pain, nausea and other 
medical symptoms, and that legalizing just one use of the drug 
would open the door to marijuana becoming legal overall.&nbsp;  In the 
early 1990s, the Bush administration stopped taking new 
applications for a US-run medical marijuana program; only eight 
persons getting the drug legally through the program are still 
alive.&nbsp;  The Clinton administration has been unwilling to reopen 
the program.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who earlier this month filed a 
bill in Congress to permit doctors once again to prescribe 
marijuana to patients with certain diseases, said that the 
political climate in this country appears to be getting in the 
way of compassionate use of the drug.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;We are allowing the political impulses to apprea 'tough on 
drugs' to interfere with alleviating pain and suffering,&quot; said 
Frank, who noted that House Speaker Newt Gingrich had been a 
cosponsor to a 1982 bill that would also have allowed doctors to 
prescribe marijuana.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Dr. Lester Grinspoon - a Harvard psychiatrist whose book, 
&quot;Marijuana: The Forbidden Medicine,&quot; is available in seven 
languages - said he believes Weld's amendment dooms the medical 
use of marijuana in this state.&nbsp;  &quot;It's a cowardly way of vetoing, 
in my view,&quot; Grinspoon said, adding that he does not expect the 
state public health program ever to get federal approval for a 
supply.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">David Mulligan, the state public health commissioner, 
disagreed, saying he is hopeful that within the next year the 
program can get approval to get a supply from the federal 
government or to grow its own marijuana under strict security.&nbsp;  
The state does not want to jeopardize negotiations by appearing 
to condone illegal use of marijuana in the meantime, Mulligan 
said.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">The stat also does not want to use marijuana seized in drug 
raids for medical purposes, he added, since it might have 
impurities that could be harmful to those with suppressed immune 
systems.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Aside from tying the medical necessity defense to participants 
in the state public health program, Weld's amendment expands the 
medical conditions that make patients eligible for the program by 
adding AIDS and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, 
Mulligan said.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Even if the state program were approved, it might not help 
Rhonda Lemoine, 39, who says she has been using marijuana to 
treat the chronic pain from muscle spasms and degenerative 
arthritis of the spine since a car accident in 1991.&nbsp;  Her 
condition is not one of the eligible medical conditions currently 
listed by the program.<br> 
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">&quot;I couldn't work for a long time&quot; with the pain and the loss

<P>Marijuana and its component cannabinoids have been demonstrated to affect many medical conditions.  However, original sources on this topic are often difficult to access, as they are diffusely distributed across a voluminous scientific literature.  This bibliography gathers most of the primary (and some of the secondary) citations available, categorized according to medical indication.

<H4>Introduction</H4>

 <P>     Widespread reports of self-medication with Cannabis have aroused medical and scientific interest in the potential application of cannabinoids for the treatment of a variely of diseases.  Some limited human trials or case studies have revealed the safety and efficacy of this class of compounds for the symptomatic treatment of a broad number of ailments.  The results of tests on other animals or in vitro experiments imply new paths of clinical investigation.  The references below represent a starting point for further inquiry.  Included are papers regardless of their experimental outcome.  Not included are citations related to the presently approved uses of THC (i.e cancer chemotherapy nausea amelioration, AIDS patient appetite stimulation).
