<H3>Project Description</H3>
Georgia Tech researchers were among the first to work on the emerging issue of repetitive motion injuries (RMIs) in food plants, conducting many early in-plant studies.  This focuses on the research goal of providing processors with objective data that will help them understand the causes of RMIs and develop the most effective approaches to preventing them.  The researchers' landmark work is in the development of a computerized Ergonomic Work Assessment System (EWAS).  The EWAS consists of several specialized devices: a knife equipped with a force and torque sensor; electromyography (EMG) instrumentation, which records the muscle force a person exerts as he or she performs a task; motion-analysis instrumentation and a video camera for tracking body position; and a computer.
<p>
In ongoing experiments, researchers are using the EWAS, in both the laboratory and in field tests, to see exactly what motions workers use and how these motions affect force, muscle exertion, and posture readings.  Current plans call for futher field tests to collect material for a large database describing the motions of processing-plant workers use as they perform their jobs.  This information will be used to evaluate the theories about the causes of RMIs.

<H3>Project Description</H3>
Recent advances in information/educational technology are making possible for the first time the development of systems which directly support the real needs of a mobile workforce.  Gloria Gery coined the term Electronic Performance Support System, or EPSS, to describe systems that provide task specific information, training, and assistance at the worksite when most needed; i.e. while completing a task.  Embedded in this process of support is a new paradigm for learning whereby the focus is shifted from training/teaching to supporting/enabling individuals to learn while they complete their work.  The power of  an EPSS rests in the integration of the many existing educational/ support technologies into one unified system directly tied into the tools used in performing the job.  In a factory setting, this concept is coined Factory Automation Support Technology (FAST).
<p>
How might one go about creating the FAST system?  The main component of the system is an infobase which contains all of the information needed to support a particular task.  The infobase would include many kinds of information including both visual and audio.  Each data element would then be indexed or tagged according to various means, and the system could then present a view of the infobase tailored to the individual.  Included in this infobase would be:
<UL>
<LI>A framework of applications which directly help the user to achieve performance,
<LI>Advisory or expert systems,
<LI>Granular interactive training sequences to encourage self-directed learning targeted for specific tasks,
<LI>Assessment support to assist the learner in identifying weaknesses, and, finally,
<li>Actual tools which assist in getting the job done.
</UL>
We created a prototype EPSS for <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/mime/papers/edmedia1l.html">origami</A> and are currently building an EPSS to help poultry plants perform water reduction audits.  We built a prototype <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/EPSS/">wearable computer</A> to allow mobile poultry plant workers to use <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/mime/papers/edmedia2.html">FAST</A> to support the performance of quality assurance inspection tasks.

Research Engineer I, 

<A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/">Intelligent Machines Branch</A>.

<H3>Date: Summer/Fall 1996</H1>

<IMG SRC="tims001.gif">

<p>

Special Thanks to :

 <A HREF="http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~gtd527a/">Peter H. Lawrence</A>

<br>

for his help in the Parallel Port interface, and Programable logic code.



<H2>Design Description:</H2>

This project was just a small part of the large 

<A HREF="http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/nattech5.htm#envmon">Environmental Sensor project</A>,

 which is using interferometers to sense the presence of pathogens.  This board

 is designed to interface the Hamamatsu S3906 Linear Image Sensor, to a standard PC.

 The S3906 is unique, in that it is randomly accessible.  This means you tell the sensor 

 which pixel you want and it gives you back the pixel value.  This has several advantages

 over a normal image sensor, in that you don't have to buffer all the data.  It also means

 that if you are only interested in a few pixels then you don't have to waist time acquiring 

 the other pixels.  This sensor also has the nice feature of a small pixel size 25um x 0.5mm.

 <p>

 It was decided that the easiest was to interface this Image sensor to the PC without any

 extra hardware(A/D or DIO boards) was to use the parallel port.  There are three main

 parallel port protocols: 

 <A HREF="http://www.paranoia.com/~filipg/HTML/LINK/PORTS/F_PARALLEL11.html">standard PS/2 mode</A>,

 <A HREF="http://www.fapo.com/ecpmode.htm">ECP mode</A>, and

 <A HREF="http://www.fapo.com/eppmode.htm">EPP mode</A>.

 PS/2 mode is slow and has no hardware handshaking, ECP has to much handshaking because the

 external device must initiate the transfer back, so EPP was chosen as the most convenient

 protocol.

 <p>

 So the design naturally falls into two parts; the analog design which converts the sensor

 output into a digital form; and the digital interface to the EPP parallel port.  The analog

 section of the design is made up of three op-amps, and an AtoD converter.  The first op-amp

 is used to amplify the video signal and remove clock switching spikes.  The second op-amp 

 is used as a low pass filter.  The third op-amp is used in conjunction with a mosfet transistor

 to remove the reset noise.  The AtoD is used to convert the voltage from the third op-amp

 to an 8-bit digital word.  The digital section consists of two data latches, two programmable

 logic chips, a programmable clock, and some combinational logic.  The data latches are used

 to save the current pixel address, and the current pixel value.  The programmable logic chips

 are used the generate the four phase clock, and the parallel port interrupt signal.  The programmable

 clock lets the user set the exposure time by changing the switches.  The combinational logic

 is used to interface to the parallel port.

 <p>

 The device is very easy to use.  It requires 5 volts at 200mAmps, and +/-15 volts at 22mAmps.

 To use the device connect the power to the screw down terminal block, and connect the ribbon

 cable to the parallel port on the computer.  Make sure the computer is in EPP mode when you

 turn it on, this is usually a BIOS setting.  The to use the device write the 8-bit address

 of the desired pixel to the address 0x37C.  Then monitor the interrupt line by reading from

 the address 0x379 and checking the seventh bit.  When the interrupt line goes low read the

 8-bit data from the address 0x37C.

<title>Poultry Environmental Control System (PECS)</title>
<body>
<hr>
<center><H2>Poultry Environmental Control System (PECS)</H2></center>
<hr>
<H3>Project Description</H3>
Most Broiler growers currently use thermostats and timers to control the environment in the growing houses.  This method requires the farm manager to constantly monitor the conditions in each house and adjust the thermostats and timers as needed.  This is a manual and tedious process and it requires that the farmers have a very good knowledge of how each thermostat and timer affect the environment in the houses.  All farmers do not possess the same skill level, so the manual method produces a wide variation in the quality of birds produced by different farmers.  A few computer control systems have recently been introduced to the market, but they are simple and lack the design and construction to allow them to survive in a Broiler house environment.  In addition their software does not screen out possible bad inputs from sensors, which results in erratic behavior when a sensor fails.
<p>
The environmental computer control system, developed on this project, constantly monitors and controls the environment, freeing the farm manager of the task of manually adjusting the thermostats and timers.  The system is able to survive the harsh conditions found in a Broiler house and will maintain good growout conditions in any house it controls, thus providing a good quality bird that does not depend on the individual knowledge of each farm manager.  It will allow farm managers to increase their production efficiency while maintaining a good quality product, which will allow them to continue to meet the growing demand for poultry.
<p>
The Poultry Environmental Control System is a micro-controller based computer system.  The system is comprised of one or more house control computers that are interfaced to an IBM PC/AT compatible host computer.  The house controllers monitor the temperature, relative humidity and ammonia inside and outside the house.  It uses these values to control the fans, heaters, curtains, and misters, thus maintaining the best environment for growing poultry.  The unique design of micro-controller driver circuits, lightning protection circuits, alarm system, and fiber optic communications make it able to survive reliably in the harsh environment of a poultry growing house, yet easy to trouble-shoot and repair it the field. 
<p>
The newly redesigned Poultry Environmental Control System (PECS) system has recently been installed in a curtain house on a poultry farm in North Georgia where, once startup is complete, the farm will serve as a demonstration site for the system.  Also, a licensing agreement has been signed with a Georgia firm, who is pursuing commercial development.

<center><H2>Robotics and Automation Project</H2></center>
<hr>
<H3>Project Description</H3>
Georgia Tech researchers are doing ground-breaking work in the area of robotics technology, developing prototype systems that meet the special needs of the food processing industry.  Current work has focused on two areas: 1) the development of a new robotic system called the Intelligent Integrated Belt Manipulator (IIBM) and 2) the use of a camera as a real-time sensor in a robots control system, i.e. visual servoing.
<p>
To overcome the inadequacy of commercially available robotic devices for handling food products, researchers have designed and developed the new robotic system called the Intelligent Integrated Belt Manipulator (IIBM). As a first implementation, a functioning prototype system has been designed and tested for the cost-effective manipulation of products on a conveyor belt.  As part of the IIBM project, the engineers have developed <A HREF="pictures/ra4.gif">multi-use grippers</A> that can handle a variety of food products, including raw meat.  The research team is fine-tuning the IIBM system so that its accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness will eventually match or exceed that of human workers.
<p>
The visual servoing work focuses on the use of vision data in the image coordinate to generate the control signals necessary to actuate a robot. To achieve this goal, the ability of the vision system to provide fast data to the controller is critical.  The uniqueness of this approach is that the errors in the image plane are to be directly mapped into the joint space of the robot with little or no dependency on any mathematical model of the robot. The effect of this would be to reduce the need for sophisticated camera calibration procedures and extensive modeling of the robot kinematic parameters.
<p>
Here is a view of the <A HREF="pictures/ra1.gif">visual servoing robot</A>, which utilizes suction to grip items.

<BR>

</CENTER></H1>

<H1><B>Computer Controllers<BR>

</B></H1>

<H2>Why use them<BR>

</H2>

<P>

With the growing emergence of computer technology in all industries

it was only a matter of time before computer technology found

its way into broiler growout houses.  The reason that computers

make sense in growout houses, is that computerized controllers

for poultry houses provide a number of benefits to both the integrator

and the grower.  Integrators can benefit in a number of ways.

 The processing plants benefit from the lower variability in the

birds that the controllers are able to provide.  Integrators can

use the on-line information provided by the system to schedule

feed deliveries and bird catching.  The service people can use

the remote capability of the systems to help diagnose problems

without an actual trip to the farm.  The service people can also

use the information they get remotely to determine the priority

of the locations that they visit. The grower, on the other hand,

benefits by having a very sophisticated tool to help with the

management of their growout operation.  A tool that will notify

them immediately of problems in the houses.  For example, a grower

with eight houses may be in his number seven house when a pipe

breaks in his number one house.  The system could sound an alarm

or call his beeper number to notify him of the problem.  Since

1982 Ga. Tech has been doing research in the area of low cost

computers for controlling broiler growout houses.  That research

resulted in a design that solved most problems encountered in

growout houses, and this article reflects lessons learned during

that research effort. <BR>

<P>

How do they work<BR>

<P>

Although there are many different types of controllers available

they all have the same basic fundamental design that can be seen

in figure 1.  They all have sensors that provide information on

the current state of the environment to a controller.  This information

is used to determine what devices (fans, heaters, curtain, foggers

and vents) need to be controlled.  Once this decision is made

control signals are sent to control circuitry to turn on or off

the actual devices.  Some of the better systems support communications

to a centrally located computer system and also allows you to

access the system remotely using a modem over the phone lines.

 The central computer system usually provides the functionality

to store, graph and print data.  It will also allow you to configure

the controllers remotely, and dial beeper and other numbers in

the case of an emergency.<BR>

<B>Types of Controllers<BR>

</B>

<P>

There are currently three categories of controllers on the market,

they are staged thermostats, staged computer controllers and setpoint

driven controllers.  This article will describe each category

and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of system.

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<P>

<B>Staged Thermostats<BR>

</B>

<P>

This type of controller allows the user to set different stages

at which devices turn on or off.  For example, you could set stage

1 to turn on 2 fans when the temperature reaches 80<SUP>o</SUP>

F, and stage 2 to turn on additional fans when the temperature

reaches 83<SUP>o</SUP> F.  The number of stages allowed as well

as the number of devices that can be controlled vary from manufacturer

to manufacturer.  Some of these systems force you to maintain

a certain sequence, for example stage 3 must always happen before

stage 4.  The more flexible systems will allow you to set any

stage to occur at any temperature, and not necessarily in any

sequence.<BR>

<P>

One major advantage that these types of systems have over the

other systems is that they tend to be a lot cheaper.  Another

advantage is that they do a much better job of controlling than

stand-alone thermostats.  One disadvantage of staged thermostat

systems is that they typically do not have any communication capability,

and thus cannot be monitored or configured from a central location.

 The user has to physically visit each house to determine what

the current system setup is and also to see what is actually happening

in the house.  Another disadvantage of this type of system is

that the user has to manually change the settings of the system

during the course of a growout.  This is because the birds require

cooler temperatures as they get older, and as a result the stages

need to be reset to meet these needs.  One other drawback to these

types of systems is that the users have to be very knowledgeable

on how the system works.  You can imagine how easy it would be

to configure the system incorrectly if you did not know exactly

what you were doing, which could have disastrous consequences.

 <BR>

<P>

<B>Staged Computer Controllers<BR>

</B>

<P>

These types of controllers work very much like the staged thermostats

in that they allow you to configure the devices to turn on or

off at certain temperatures.  The user interface provided by these

systems allow you to have a lot more control over devices than

the staged thermostat systems.  A staged thermostat system, for

instance, may limit you to turning on 3 devices at stage 1 when

the temperature reaches 80<SUP>o</SUP>  F.  The staged computer

controller will typically allow you to turn on or off a single

device at a specified temperature.  For example, you could turn

on fan 1 when the temperature reached 80<SUP>o</SUP> F and fan

2 when the temperature reaches 81<SUP>o</SUP> F and so on.  Staged

computer controllers typically have some sort of communication

capability that allows you to monitor and configure the controllers

from a central location.  They usually have a centrally located

computer that communicates to all the controllers located in the

individual houses at that location.  The central computer has

the capability to automatically store information about the state

of the houses.  Most systems will record the temperatures during

the course of a growout, and allow you to graph and print that

information.  These systems typically have a modem that will allow

you to access them remotely over the phone line, and can also

call beepers and other numbers in case of problems in a house.

 Staged computer controllers suffer from some of the same disadvantages

that the staged thermostats do, some of them require you to manually

change the settings of the system during the course of a growout.

 And they also require that you be very knowledgeable on how the

systems works, since it would be even easier to configure these

system incorrectly if you did not know exactly what you were doing.

 <BR>

<BR>

<P>

<B>Setpoint Driven Controllers<BR>

</B>

<P>

These types of systems take a different approach to controlling

the environment than the staged systems do.  They make intelligent

decisions as to what devices to turn on/off based on the current

environmental conditions.  You configure them, at installation,

so they know what fans, heaters, curtains, foggers are available

to be controlled and what sensor are available for providing information,

and they automatically determine what devices to turn on or off.

 These systems require that you specify the setpoint at which

you want it to control the environment, and they make all the

decisions as to how to do that.  These systems usually provide

better control of the environment than staged systems, because

they are more aware of the interactions of the different devices

in the house.  For example, one problem that occurs in the cooler

times of the year is the problem of cycling which occurs when

it is cold outside and the birds are old enough to heat the house

with their bodies.  A fan will come-on and run for a while to

cool the house, and turn off when the house is cool enough.  Shortly

afterwards another fan, that is on a two out of ten minute ventilation

cycle, will turn-on to ventilate the house, and results in cooling

the house below the required level.  At this point heaters turn-on

to bring the temperature back up to an acceptable level.  A setpoint

driven system will know that a fan had been running for cooling

purposes and as a result also provided the minimum ventilation

requirements, and would not turn-on another fan for ventilation

purposes.  These systems also consider outside conditions when

making decisions, so they will not turn on foggers if it's raining

outside or if it's nighttime.  They also make intelligent decisions

like turning off exhaust and tunnel fans if the side curtains

are all the way down.  And like staged computer controllers, these

systems also have communication capability that allow you to monitor

and configure the individual controllers from a central location.

 Picture 1 and 2 show two of the screens available on the central

computer of the system developed at Ga. Tech.  The screen shown

in picture 1 allows you to configure the system operation and

the screen in picture 2 shows the current house status.  Setpoint

driven systems also provide the functionality of recording, graphing

and printing flock related data, and can be accessed remotely

using a modem over the phone lines.  They will also call beepers

and other programmed phone numbers in the event of problems in

the houses.  These types of systems typically don't require that

you know very much about how to program them, since they are making

all the decisions themselves.  One major disadvantage of these

types of systems is that they tend to be more expensive than the

other systems.<BR>

<H1><B>Controller Reliability<BR>

</B></H1>

<P>

Reliability is a major factor for a device that is responsible

for correctly controlling the environment in growout houses and

providing valuable information to growers and integrators.  The

way that the systems handle the failure of sensors, communications

and its other components is very important and determines the

systems' reliability.  There are three major areas that affect

the overall reliability of computer control systems, they are

sensors, lightning protection and backup systems.<BR>

<P>

<B>Sensors<BR>

</B>

<P>

Sensors are the eyes and ears of the computer system and are responsible

for providing the computer with accurate information about the

current state of the environment.  A computer control system is

only as good as its sensors.  Unfortunately, sensors are the most

likely part of a computer system to fail because of their constant

exposure to the elements and electrical surges that get to them.

 For this reason, it is essential that controllers have more than

one temperature sensor.  Just as you would not consider controlling

a growout house with just one thermostat, you should not expect

a computer system to control with only one temperature sensor.

 Not only would you be depending on one sensor for the life of

your flock, but the system will not have the ability to detect

and correct hot and cold spots in various parts of the house.

 A good rule of thumb for determining the number of sensors needed

to control the environment is: the number of sensors should be

equal to the number of thermostats needed to control your exhaust

or tunnel fans, and certainly no less than three sensors for a

four hundred foot house.  In addition to having the correct number

of sensors the computer system must be capable of using them correctly.

 A sensor usually fails by sticking at some value that never changes,

for example it may report that the temperature is 60<SUP>o</SUP>

F when it is actually 85<SUP>o</SUP> F in the house.  If you have

three or more sensors, the computer should be able to compare

the different sensor values and determine if any are defective.

 For example, if one sensor is reporting 60<SUP>o</SUP> F and

the other sensors are reporting around 85<SUP>o</SUP> F the computer

should be able to recognize that the 60<SUP>o</SUP> F sensor is

bad, and not use its value when controlling the house.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<P>

<B>Lightning protection<BR>

</B>

<P>

Most devices (fans, heaters, foggers, etc.) found in a poultry

growout house operate on 120 or 240 volts AC.  An electrical surge

of under 20 volts will not usually have any effect on these devices.

 Most computers, on the other hand operate at 5 volts DC with

a tolerance of +/- 0.25 volts.  Which means that an electrical

surge of more that 0.25 volts will cause the computer to fail,

for this reason it is essential that computer systems have some

sort of lightning and surge protection.  Picture 3 shows two computer

chips that were destroyed by a lightning strike close to their

location during Ga. Tech's development project.  Surge protection

for AC devices can usually be as simple as a fuse, whereas, a

fuse is totally inadequate for computer systems because the computer

will be damaged before the fuse has a chance to blow.  Surge protection

for computers usually involve a combination of devices like spark-gaps,

transzorbs, MOVs and inductors which are all designed to respond

quickly enough to protect the computer.<BR>

<HR>

<P>

<CENTER>Picture 3<BR>

</CENTER>

<P>

Three main areas from which surges usually enter a computer system

are: the AC power line, the communication lines connecting the

controller to the central computer, and the sensor lines.  The

AC power line can be protected by a good (about $60) surge suppressed

outlet strip, and  there is a variety of signal conditioning devices

that can be purchased to protect the communication lines from

surges.  One drawback to many of these surge suppressors is that

in protecting the lines from surges the protection devices are

destroyed (they are designed to work that way), and your communication

line may be inoperative and vulnerable to other surges until the

surge protection device is replaced.  One method of completely

eliminating surges on the communication lines is to replace them

with fiber optic lines, which has become a very cost effective

solution.  Fiber optic cable was used by Ga. Tech in their control

system, which resulted in the complete elimination of communication

line surge based failures over a five year period.  The sensor

lines that bring information back to the computer need to be protected

also.  The long length of the wire that run from a sensor to the

controller can pick up surges from lightning strikes up to a few

miles away.  This surge will come straight into the computer system

unless some protection scheme is employed.  <BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<P>

<B>Backups Systems<BR>

</B>

<P>

Computer controllers, like most devices, will fail from time to

time and their backup systems need to automatically take control

of the house operation without operator intervention. This can

be accomplished by wiring the computer system in parallel with

the thermostats and timers that would normally have been installed

as if the houses were going to be operated manually.  An additional

benefit to having these thermostats installed is that they can

be used to automatically turn on fans and heaters if the computer

system is down or out being repaired.  The thermostats are set

outside the range that the computer is set to control the house

and kick-in automatically if the temperature reaches that setting.

 For example, let us say you want to have the house temperature

at 70<SUP>o</SUP> F and you set your computer to control at this

temperature.  You can then set your heater thermostats to come

on at 65<SUP>o</SUP> F.  If the computer is malfunctioning, you

are guaranteed that the temperature will not fall below 65<SUP>o</SUP>

F.  In addition to the automated backups, it is important that

the system has some mechanism to notify you that it is not functioning

correctly.  This can be accomplished with alarm horns that come

on at the same time that the backup system kicks-in.  A good way

to tell if you have adequate backups is to turn the computer system

off and observe what happens.  A good backup system will automatically

control the house and provide a reasonable environment for the

birds, and will notify you of the problem.<BR>

<BR>

<P>

<B>Conclusion<BR>

</B>

<P>

Computer controllers have recently begun to emerge with regularity

in broiler growout houses. In five years you will be hard pressed

to find a growout operation that does not have some sort of computer

system installed.  The systems will gradually become more sophisticated

and reliable as manufacturers gain experience with operating computer

systems in growout environments.  Integrators and growers will

find that the advantages gained by the reduced variability in

the birds and the on-line information provided, far outweigh the

costs of the systems.  While this evolution takes place, integrators

and growers need to begin to position themselves so that they

are able to deal with this new era in the poultry industry.  They

need to consider how the grower contracts are going to change,

since most growers will be producing the same quality birds, and

they also need to be aware of the controller system performance

features that are critical to a successful operation.  Although

there will be some growing-pains during this evolution, the overall

impact on the poultry industry will be a positive one.

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">The goal of the Farm computer project

was to install and test an environmental control system in a tunnel

ventilated, curtain controlled, poultry broiler growing house.

 The main thrusts of this project were to:<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk"> Develop a micro-processor based

controller board with enough inputs and outputs to control the

different devices found in a tunnel ventilated, curtain controlled

house.</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk"> </FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk"> Develop, implement and test control

algorithms that effectively control the environment in the house.

 <BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">The algorithms were developed to

control curtains and tunnel ventilated fans using inputs from

poultry farmers, University of Georgia and Georgia Tech researchers.

  The algorithms were coded in 'C', compiled into executable form

and loaded into EPROM on the controller board.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">The controller and lightning protection

cards were mounted in an enclosure along with a power supply.

 The entire unit was installed in a poultry growing house in Jefferson,

Georgia owned by Mr. Douglas Martin.  The system continues to

run without any problems and produced a better feed conversion

than the other houses on the farm.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">The goal of the Ergonomic Research

project was to add the capability to track 3D joint and angle

motion to the Ergonomic Work Assesment System (EWAS).  The work

performed under this project has resulted in the acquision of

a motion tracking system and the integration of this system into

EWAS for the purpose of tracking wrist angles.  Research efforts

involving EWAS have focused on carpel tunnel syndrone and therefore

a motion tracking system capable of autonomously recording wrist

angles was essential.  Work performed under this project involved

a detailed analysis of potential motion analysis systems, recommendation

and acquisition of a system, system setup and training, integration

into EWAS, and system testing.  Although the main goal was to

acquire a system for tracking wrist angles, ideally the system

would be applicable to the study of other Cummulative Trauma Disorders

(CTD) related injuries involving the back, legs, shoulders, etc.

 The system chosen is modular in the sense that it can be configured

to track the motion of any specific joint as well as multiple

joints.<BR>

<P>

This report covers the work done on project A9533-000 over the

period of  10/93 - 11/94.  It discusses the hardware and software

design, and the implementation and installation of the system.

 <BR>

<P>

The first section is this introduction and the second section

gives an overview of the existing technology and summarizes the

work done on this project.  The third section describes the design

and implementation of both the hardware and the software.  The

fourth section provides a conclusion to the project.  The Appendicies

give detailed information on the operation of the program on the

<B>2. OVERVIEW<BR>

</B>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">Most Broiler growers currently use

thermostats and timers to control the environment in the growing

houses.  This method requires the farm manager to constantly monitor

the conditions in each house and adjust the thermostats and timers

as needed.  This is a manual and tedious process and it requires

that the farmers have a very good knowledge of how each thermostat

and timer affect the environment in the houses.  All farmers do

not possess the same skill level, so the manual method produces

a wide variation in the quality of birds produced by different

farmers.  A few computer control systems have recently been introduced

to the market, but they are simple and lack the design and construction

to allow them to survive in a Broiler house environment.  They

do not address the adverse conditions of high dust levels, lightning

protection and corrosion due to high ammonia and relative humidity

levels.  In addition their software does not screen out possible

bad inputs from sensors, which results in erratic behavior when

a sensor fails.<BR>

</FONT>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">The environmental computer control

system, developed on this project, constantly monitors and controls

the environment, freeing the farm manager of the task of manually

adjusting the thermostats and timers.  The system is able to survive

the harsh conditions found in a Broiler house and will maintain

good growout conditions in any house it controls, thus providing

a good quality bird that does not depend on the individual knowledge

of each farm manager.  It will allow farm managers to increase

their production efficiency while maintaining a good quality product.

 Which will allow them to continue to meet the growing demand

for poultry.<BR>

</CENTER>
<P><B>PROBLEM</B><BR>
<BR>
The use of electronic media for both instruction development and delivery
is increasing rapidly. This advancement brings many new questions concerning
responsibility for selection and use, copyright ownership, and information
accuracy. Instructional Technologists must examine these issues, confront
their implications for the field, and participate actively in ethical policy
formation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NATURE OF THE CONTROVERSY</B><BR>
<BR>
Many instructional technologists openly embrace computers as a valued educational
tool, yet many of us have failed to examine the potential impact of our
recommendations. Take for example the recent case reported on Entertainment
Tonight January 30, 1993. In this story an elementary school purchased a
powerful computer simulation game to teach students about slavery before
the civil war. Teachers allowed the students to use the program without
any instruction even though the program came with extensive introductory
and debriefing materials. Consequently, many of the students became confused
and disturbed when their actions in the game resulted in simulated hanging
or whipping. Contrary to what one might expect, everyone involved is blaming
the team who developed the simulation for the problems. Subsequently, at
the request of the school involved in the incident, the publisher has stopped
shipment of the product and recalled existing copies. Although no charges
are currently pending in this case, the possibility exists. <BR>
<BR>
This incident brings up a number of important questions concerning responsibility
for the misuse of instructional media with negative impact on students.
Is the teacher liable or the media producer? Does it matter if it is in
electronic or printed form? The use of electronic media for instructional
purposes presents a number of ethical challenges for teachers and instructional
designers.<BR>
<BR>
Other issues of importance concern electronically copying, modifying, and
distributing copyrighted material for educational or other purposes. Take
for example the development of a multimedia presentation by a teacher for
her class. Is it acceptable and legal for her to copy photographs from a
current magazine for display to a class? Is it legal to videotape a television
show and later replay it for a class? Does the source and or purpose matter?
The same questions hold true for professional developers who may easily
electronically modify a picture, video segment, music clip, or other media
so that it is unrecognizable from the original. Is this acceptable practice?
Compounding this problem is a growing pressure to use electronic media in
the classroom with little or no budget or training. Development of multimedia
brings a new set of obstacles concerning where and how one obtains necessary
permissions to include copyrighted clips and when it may or may not be necessary
to obtain these rights. Answers to these questions have a direct impact
on the practice of instructional technology.<BR>
<BR>
Another problem looming on the horizon concerns liability and responsibility
for accuracy of content delivered through electronic media. When it comes
to legal questions, the courts are much more forgiving in their interpretation
of liability for information provided in books. Only those errors that occur
out of gross negligence are generally punished (Samuelson 1993). The courts
have refused to hold either the seller, publisher, or author accountable
for the accuracy of published information when in the form of book. However,
the law is evolving and there may be some precedents developing to treat
electronic information differently than printed material.<BR>
<BR>
<B>GENERAL ISSUES OF CONCERN<BR>
<BR>
Professional Behavior</B> <BR>
<BR>
AECT has developed and published an extensive Code of Ethics to provide
guidance to members in maintaining a high level of professional conduct.
Although this code is not specifically aimed at issues concerning electronic
media, many of the principles are very applicable. In what follows a number
of artificial case studies are examined and recommendations for conduct
are suggested based on the principles of the AECT code.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Viewpoint Limiting Media</B> <BR>
<BR>
Consider the case of a task force created to come up with a method to meet
a new state directive requiring a comprehensive energy conservation curriculum
for all grades. A previous directive encourages the use of new delivery
technologies whenever possible. One member suggests employing an upcoming
series of free satellite broadcast from a consortium of energy companies.
Eager to embrace electronic instructional media, the committee finds it
difficult to resist the suggestion. Although an innocuous suggestion on
the surface, what are the implications of adopting such a plan? First of
all, one must question the use of media created by a party with a specific
point of view as the sole source of information. At the very least, the
origin of the material should be clearly labeled so that potential biases
become apparent to the viewers (Nichols, 1990). Other groups such as conservationists
surely have equally significant viewpoints. It all comes down to the age
old problem of balancing depth of content with range of content. <BR>
<BR>
When employing electronic media, we must take steps to insure that our own
personal beliefs do not limit the viewpoints made available to students.
What responsibility do we have to insure that even though we may be convinced
that a particular media or method of instruction provides superior learning
opportunities that in choosing it we do not limit range of opinion students
may be exposed to? This may be of particular importance when we employ new
evolving technologies that have only limited prepared materials available
currently. Multimedia and other electronic information sources are prime
examples.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Electronic Invasion of Privacy</B><BR>
<BR>
Next consider the case of a library media specialist who is actively acquiring
an expanding collection of films, videos, audio tapes, CDs, and software.
When offered a set of interactive videodiscs and computer hardware to teach
adult literacy the specialist enthusiastically accepts. Later, after the
program becomes established and the literacy materials are accessed frequently,
further outside assistance is offered. If a literacy volunteer could review
the electronic database of users, a worker could contact them personally
to offer individual tutoring and encouragement to perhaps pursue a high
school diploma as well. The offer seems sincere and well intended.<BR>
<BR>
What obligation does the librarian have to protect the privacy of the individuals
using the literacy materials? What harm could possibly come of providing
further assistance? One's first reaction might be to accept this personal
assistance. What if the people become embarrassed or worse yet their inability
to read gets back to their employer? AECT suggests that an individual's
right to privacy should be maintained above all else (Welliver, 1990). Our
enthusiasm for helping others to learn should not cloud this issue. Perhaps
a solution to this situation would be to make available additional information,
written or spoken, describing the other services available along with telephone
numbers to call for assistance. In this way the privacy of the individuals
can be protected while the full services are made available. <BR>
<BR>
As delivery of instruction through electronic media continues to grow one
must consider the potential privacy consequences. Electronic media provides
the opportunity to deliver instruction in rich interactive formats. Included
also is the ability to capture a tremendous amount of information concerning
individual performance, knowledge base, and skill evaluation. This information
could be captured with or without the student's knowledge. Employers could
potentially use such a database to monitor their employees and base advancement
decisions upon this data; a practice known as dataveillance (Clarke, 1991).
Worse yet, interactive home based electronic media could also be used to
monitor and target consumer weaknesses and buying preferences in ways that
are hard to imagine today.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Electronic Opinions</B><BR>
<BR>
Another issue concerns our personal evaluations of particular instructional
systems involving electronic media. What happens when ones' personal opinion
is irreconcilable with that offered by the organization to which one belongs?
Take for example the case of an IT professor who reads an article on the
Internet describing a new computer network to be installed throughout his
or her state to interconnect all elementary schools in conjunction with
the university. Reading on it becomes obvious to the professor that the
proposed plan includes a number of serious design flaws. The professor responds
to the article by posting an electronic reply with the name of their university
clearly identified in the heading of the message. Although nothing is obviously
wrong, what happens when someone else in the state notices the message and
begins to question the project as well because of the clear institutional
involvement?<BR>
<BR>
The question comes down to what responsibility does one have to insure that
his or her personal opinion is kept separate from that of his or her organization?
Also, what steps can one ethically take to expose less than perfect plans
that have been previously given approval by ones' organization? Clearly,
it is imperative that we do not use the stature of our organization to lend
credence to personal opinions. AECT code states we must honestly represent
the organizations to which we belong and take all precautions to distinguish
between individual opinion and institutional or organizational views; particularly
when our opinions differ.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Consulting Opportunities</B><BR>
<BR>
Another frequent problem occurring in any profession concerns the use of
organizational privilege for personal gain. Take for example the case of
the talented instructional multimedia designer whom a company depends on
and has given great responsibility for contact with both prospective and
active clients. When this employee is denied the financial rewards he or
she feels are fair what recourse does one have? Even though it may be both
legal and acceptable to quit the present position and take a job with a
competitor or open ones' own business, how do you handle the personal client
contacts you have established? Experienced multimedia developers are in
short supply today and can often command substantial financial packages.<BR>
<BR>
Additionally, consider the case of another talented instructional designer
who is offered personal contract work in addition to their normal job. When
is it a conflict of interest and when is it merely personal achievement
and recognition? If the work is pursued, what if any equipment belonging
to the employer may be used to develop materials for outside consulting?
Does it matter if the material is to be delivered electronically and does
not consume any office supplies? <BR>
<BR>
At the heart of the matter is a question of ownership. How much of a professional's
skill belongs to the individual and how much to the organization? Who owns
established business relationships? Is open competition always fair and
just? These are complex issues without simple answers. AECT takes the stand
that one should never use his or her organizational privilege for personal
gain (Moller, 1993).<BR>
<BR>
In the next section issues specific to the use and development of electronic
media for instructional purposes are explored. Questions arising from the
ease at which information may be copied and redistributed are examined including
the evolution of intellectual property rights in the electronic information
age. Copyright issues specific to the development of computer based interactive
multimedia are also be discussed. Also, legal liability is discussed and
predictions made for the future.<BR>
<BR>
<B>COPYRIGHT CONCEPTS<BR>
<BR>
Basic Concepts of Intellectual Property</B><BR>
<BR>
In order to understand the implications of copyrights in developing and
using instructional media we must first examine a few basic concepts such
as the definition of intellectual property. <BR>
<BR>
Intellectual property can be distinguished from other forms of property
in that it is a bundle of rights attached to the intangible form of an intellectual,
scientific, or artistic creation. While personal property law determines
ownership over <I>things</I>, intellectual property law secures ownership
in the particular form or expression <I>embodied in things </I>(OTA 1986).<BR>
<BR>
What then is an intellectual property <I>right</I> such as a patent or copyright?
<BR>
<BR>
An intellectual property right is the exclusive prerogative to make tangible
objects in particular forms. At its simplest, a <I>copyright</I> is the
exclusive right to make copies particular tangible expressions of information,
and a <I>patent</I> is the exclusive right to make, use, or sell a particular
application of an idea (OTA 1986).<BR>
<BR>
All property rights must have boundaries so as to define the ownership exclusivity
of the property. We must somehow be able to distinguish between what one
personally owns and that which belongs to others. Boundaries of tangible
property such as a home are usually easy to define. Intellectual boundaries
are much more difficult to define. In this case a clear distinction is drawn
between the expression of an idea and the actual ideas, systems, or methods
expressed. A copyright covers only a particular form of expression of the
ideas.<BR>
<BR>
Several related principles can be derived from the above. First of all,
to be copyrightable a work must be original. This means that it must be
created independently but does not necessarily have to be completely novel.
Secondly, copyrights extend to derivative works which result from building
upon the initial. Third, infringement occurs when a substantial similarity
of expression occurs between an original and another work using knowledge
of the first. Finally, copyright ownership pertains only to the actual expression
and not the copy in which it is embodied. The copy usually becomes the private
property of the purchaser. <BR>
<BR>
When one considers information and ideas that are expressed completely in
electronic form the concepts of copyrights are much harder to apply. Take
for example the concept of derivative works. If one improves upon the functional
concepts of a previous program through refined user interface development,
when does the new version become original? If existing printed materials
are converted to electronic form and presented in a new way for a new purpose,
such as instruction, when is the electronic designer expressing a new idea
rather than merely copying existing ones? Simple answers are not to be found.<BR>
<BR>
Interestingly, the whole concept of copyright protection has its roots in
a concern to insure free flow of information and encourage learning. The
Statute of Anne was passed in 1709 by the English Parliament and represents
perhaps the first modern copyright law. Entitled &quot;A Bill for the Encouragement
of Learning and for Securing the Property of Copies of Books to the Rightful
Owners Thereof.&quot; This statue was designed to weaken the control of
publishers and insure the public maintained open access to printed media
for the purpose of learning (OTA, 1986). It also clearly pointed to ownership
rights of authors. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Implications of Electronic Media</B><BR>
<BR>
Technology is rapidly evolving to a digital standard in both business and
the home. Music offers a prime example. Compact Discs (CDs) are in reality
a digital recording of original music. Although to date music CDs remain
read only, Digital Audio Tape (DAT) which plays and records digitally is
becoming widely available. In the near future, High Definition Television
(HDTV) will most likely be broadcast in an all digital format thus allowing
near perfect video recordings as well. There is also growing interest in
home based computers and other interactive technologies such as Compact
Disc Interactive (CDI).<BR>
<BR>
Without a doubt, advancements in computer technology and the proliferation
of digital electronic information delivery systems are impeding the enforcement
of copyright law. These technologies allow for exact copies of digital information
to be made quickly, privately, and cheaply. Additionally, multiple copies
can be made from a single original without loss of fidelity and redistributed
if so desired. An original is not required to produce a copy of original
quality. This situation differs drastically from the capital and labor required
to make a similar quality copy of printed material.<BR>
<BR>
Computer software by its' very nature has always been digital in nature.
Now, as more and more content material accompanies the functional computer
program the question of copyright becomes even more important. Many futurists
predict that in the not too distant future interactive electronic books
will compete and begin to replace printed textbooks especially in the area
of instruction (King &amp; Iacono, 1990). All of these developments point
to the glaring inadequacies of current copyright law and the need for strong
ethical guidance in these areas. Today it is easier to make an exact copy
then to purchase an original. Persons involved in education, with an increasing
focus on electronic media, need to inform themselves of these issues and
establish an ethical framework for their personal and institutional involvement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEW TECHNOLOGICAL CONCERNS<BR>
<BR>
Electronic Capture and Modification</B><BR>
<BR>
Cutting and pasting with scissors is almost a forgotten art of the past.
Today it is no longer necessary or desirable to manipulate any kind of information
it this manner. The computer has become the quintessential editing machine
allowing an operator to quickly modify text, audio, and now even video material.
It no longer matters if the material was originally created on the computer
since inexpensive scanners are readily available. These scanners are capable
of digitizing a printed document containing text, artwork, and color photographs.
Advancements in multimedia technology have made it just as easy to digitize
a video clip with accompanying audio if desired.<BR>
<BR>
Once captured this data may be easily manipulated and transformed into something
completely unrecognizable and distinct from the original. This may occur
through either modification of the captured data or construction of an entirely
new presentation method and or purpose. Many leading manufacturers of multimedia
products are actively encouraging this exact behavior. <BR>
<BR>
At a recent commercial seminar several multimedia presentations that had
been developed by teachers and students were demonstrated. In every case
the source material was copied from commercial sources such as television,
a CD, or a videodisc. Without a doubt the message expressed in each case
clearly differed from the original work, yet each component was individually
copyrighted. Although not explicitly mentioned, it appeared unlikely that
neither the producers nor the demonstrators had obtained any sort of legal
permission to use the materials for the multimedia presentation. Although
such a presentation may be acceptable in a classroom setting, the legality
changes with public demonstration in a marketing situation. In this case
the expression of the original idea clearly changed yet the content remained
the same. In many cases this not a conscious effort to benefit from the
work of another but instead:<BR>
<BR>
Now, talent, creativity, works of art are also in an intangible fashion
being transmitted and we are not aware of the fact we are stealing; that
we are, in fact, impinging. We are encroaching on somebody's rights. That
has to be transmitted. The new technology is now putting things in a new
format and we have to be taught to look at in a new way (OTA 1986).<BR>
<BR>
An even greater possibility exists that digitally captured information will
be manipulated by a computer before display rendering it apparently distinct
from the original. However, such examples are clearly derivative works that
are completely covered under copyright law. As the technology to make these
transformations becomes more readily available to the general public the
acceptance of such practice will certainly grow whether legal or not. It
is noteworthy that concerns similar to these prompted Apple Computer to
consider restricting the capabilities of QuickTime (Markoff, 1992), a multimedia
enabling software technology recently released.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Video Use</B><BR>
<BR>
The widespread availability of the video tape recorder now makes it possible
to include video as part of nearly any learning activity. Yet, most people
are unaware of the actual issues and laws regarding video use in a classroom.
A recent article by Becker (1990) examines some of the issues surrounding
instructional use of video and suggests the following guidelines:<BR>
<BR>
1) According to the law, educators may publicly perform copyrighted materials
for face-to-face instruction. This means that the material must be incorporated
into a systematic learning activity and not just used for filler, reward,
or entertainment. Consequently, rented videotapes may be shown to a class
only for instructional purposes.<BR>
<BR>
2) Television may be taped for delayed instructional use only if the material
is available by open air broadcast. This does not include direct satellite
reception. Even then use is limited to 10 days from the time of broadcast
and must be erased within 45 days. Only two viewings are permitted without
special permission. <BR>
<BR>
3) Cable channels which operate as pay services such as Cinemax and HBO
or channels from very distant sources may not be legally taped and replayed
for instructional uses. Schools in remote areas are permitted additional
leeway and may tape instructional programs from satellite or cable sources
when no open-air access is available. However, the same restrictions apply
to pay services.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Multimedia </B><BR>
<BR>
Technical hurdles to the widespread use of computer based interactive multimedia
are rapidly being overcome. More and more systems are being shipped multimedia
ready and new low-cost technologies are aggressively being marketed to the
home user. Additionally, the cost of development tools is decreasing in
cost while increasing in user friendliness opening up authoring possibilities
to a much wider audience than ever before; at least technically. Although
an authoring package cannot compensate for poor design, instructional or
otherwise, the availability of low-cost hardware and software certainly
allows more people to get involved. Even with these advancements a major
stumbling block remains, content.<BR>
<BR>
Ultimately, the quality of content in a multimedia production often determines
the success or failure of the project. Consumers and students have become
very media savvy. Consequently, their expectations as to what they expect
to see, hear, and do with a multimedia product are quite high. These expectations
include both the technical capabilities of the presentation; i.e., motion
video, sound, animation, and color graphics, as well expectations for content
quality equal to that of MTV, the evening news, or the latest Star Trek
special effects. Anything less is surely to lessen the impact of the experience.<BR>
<BR>
Most companies and instructional developers have little experience with
securing copyright permissions from the multitude of parties potentially
involved in a multimedia title. Typically, media rights are negotiated one
at a time on an individual basis for a single production (Zimmerman, 1993).
This means that separate organizations must be contacted for each of the
media types to be employed. This places a tremendous burden on the developer
to locate appropriate licensers; an effort that is often cost prohibitive.<BR>
<BR>
Often, the rights organizations are unaware of multimedia requirements and
are ill-prepared to license their intellectual property for computer use.
Take for example a stock photography distributor who routinely charges $100
for a single picture for minor use. If 500 pictures are needed for the production
the total reaches $50,000 not including the cost incurred in the negotiations
(Zimmerman, 1993). This is clearly untenable for all except the largest
of corporations. Additional fees will be required for all of the media forms
as well. Clearly, the questions of copyright licensing could become a major
stumbling block to the widespread development and use of multimedia in training
and instruction.<BR>
<BR>
<B>LEGAL LIABILITIES<BR>
<BR>
Accuracy of Content</B><BR>
<BR>
Electronic media for instruction or training often takes the form of a software
program. Today, if software is embedded in a machine such as an airplane
or a medical device, the developer can be held liable for defects in the
software which result in the injury of a consumer (Samuelson 1993). The
issue becomes less clear for software which serves as a reference or instructional
media and contains errors in content which if followed results in harm to
an individual.<BR>
<BR>
To date consumers have been unsuccessful in suing publishers or booksellers
for breach of warranty regarding incorrect information. The courts have
extended the concept of warranty to include only the physical characteristics
of the book. In the case of Cardozo vs. True the judge issued the following
statement:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is unthinkable that standards imposed on the quality of goods sold
by a merchant would require that merchant, who is a bookseller, to evaluate
the thought processes of the many and hundreds and often thousands of books
which the merchant offers for sale (Samuelson 1993).&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B><U></U></B><BR>
<BR>
<B><U></U></B> There has been at least one case however, where a publisher
was held accountable for the design of a series of aeronautical charts.
In the case of Aetna vs. Jeppensen the judge ruled that the publisher failed
in its design goal to graphically represent the information in a readily
understandable way. Here the charts were described as &quot;highly technical
tools&quot; similar to a navigation instrument. These charts were contrasted
with a simple book said to be based on &quot;pure thought and expression.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Although the signals appear mixed there are a number of reasons why an electronic
book or training system might risk greater liability. First, anything electronic
has a more technical character and is usually engineered in some fashion
like a hard product. Second, advertising claims of user-friendliness and
interactivity might be construed as creating an express warranty leading
students or consumers to believe that some form of usability engineering
or guidelines were used to develop the product. Third, most people place
greater trust in information that has been computerized and naturally expect
greater care has been taken to insure its accuracy. Fourth, electronic media
products provide less opportunity than a book for the consumer to examine
the product before purchase. On-line pay-for-use services have an even greater
responsibility because of a further reduction in pre-purchase examination.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>CONCLUSIONS</B><BR>
<BR>
The final section of this paper will extend the concepts thus presented
and attempt to draw a series of conclusions and predictions for the future
concerning ethical responsibilities for electronic media users, developers,
and providers. A potential role for the instructional technologist will
also be examined.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Next Great HOPE or OBSTACLE?</B><BR>
<BR>
Electronic media offers the next great hope for revolutionizing education
and the delivery of instruction according to many experts. As the technologies
of computing, telecommunications, and entertainment continue to converge
many envision a technology centered future for education. This future will
allow teachers to combine text, audio, animation, and video to create a
media rich interactive learning environment which easily adapts to individual
differences in learning styles. Currently, much of the effort focuses on
overcoming technical and financial barriers limiting use and availability
of the technology. These efforts include increasing funding for development,
hiring of support staff, exposure and training of faculty, introduction
of lower cost hardware, and construction of easier to use development tools.
However, these problems may turn out to be minor compared to issues concerning
the ethical, legal, and liability ramifications associated with electronic
media.<BR>
<BR>
In this paper a number of issues related to these questions have been considered.
In every case it is apparent that current public policy is not keeping pace
with the advancement of technology. Consequently, current laws and ethical
guidelines are often lacking or at least extremely confusing and vague when
applied to electronic media. In many cases those guidelines which do exist,
such as intellectual property rights, present such obstacles that following
these guidelines may be the most time consuming and expensive aspect of
electronic media based instruction (Gilbert, 1992). If the current licensing
situation does not change one can easily predict that the ultimate success
of electronic media as an educational tool will fall far short of current
expectations.<BR>
<BR>
If the concept of &quot;fair use&quot; from copyright law is extended to
electronic media then the burden placed on non-profit educational efforts
may be reduced. However, the initial shortage of available materials associated
with the introduction of any new technology makes commercialization a distinct
possibility of nearly any new project. When this line is crossed, new laws
and responsibilities come into play. Many shades of gray exist in this domain
as the interpretation of the law continues to evolve. If electronic media
is to serve as a catalyst for true educational change then existing organizations,
laws, and ethical guidelines must also evolve to encourage responsible adoption
and use of the technology. In some cases completely new institutions may
be needed.<BR>
<BR>
A few organizations such as Kinko's, the Copyright Clearance Center, and
the National Association of College Stores have begun to provide &quot;permission
clearinghouses&quot; to assist faculty in obtaining legal permission to
use portions of texts in compilations such as course notes. PUBNET, an electronic
book ordering system by the Association of American Publishers, allows people
to electronically request copyright permissions directly from publishers
(Van Bergen, 1992). In the future it is hoped that these permission services
will begin to assume leadership roles for electronic copyright concerns
as well. Additionally, the film, photographic, and record industries have
begun to at least recognize electronic media needs as distinct from traditional
publishing requirements. It is too early to predict the success or failure
of these efforts. The services available today represent only a small step
towards meeting current needs much less future requirements. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Technological or Human Problems</B><BR>
<BR>
Many of the ethical questions arise from the complexity of electronic media
technology. This technical complexity tends to blur traditional ethics and
laws resulting in the hesitant application of existing rules to the new
contexts. It is important to remember however, that the technology of electronic
media may contribute to the way people commit questionable acts but in no
way cause these actions to be taken. Users of the technology make human
choices to employ or not to employ the technology in specific ways. It is
these human choices which must be influenced.<BR>
<BR>
Research has shown that the majority of abuses occur not out of deliberate
attempts to circumvent accepted practice, but instead by people who simply
have not thought the issues through (Webster, 1992). Often enamored and
fascinated by the power of electronic media and associated tools, faculty
developers, students, and other users fail to examine the underlying implications
of their actions. The widespread acceptance of the idea that education operates
under a different set of rules also complicates the matter.<BR>
<BR>
At the University of Michigan a program entitled Think About It was designed
and implemented to facilitate discussion related to information technology
ethics in general (Stager, 1992). After a successful pilot program, requests
for additional discussion sessions continue on a regular basis. Winthrop
College has developed a written policy specifically concerning electronic
media and made it widely available on the campus and to other organizations
(Rezmierski, 1992). Any group involved in electronic media, especially education
and training organizations, should encourage similar ethics activities.
<BR>
<BR>
Many instructional technologists are increasingly being called upon to assume
leadership roles in efforts to infuse electronic media into education and
training. As a result, IT professionals are increasingly being sought for
advice concerning ethical and legal issues as well as instructional concerns.
In the future this reliance will certainly increase. Consequently, the instructional
technologist of the future must seek out the latest information on these
issues and actively encourage open discussions within their organizations.
The time has come to start anticipating and preparing for these challenges
before they occur.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Beyond Ethics and Copyright - Liability</B><BR>
<BR>
For the most part instructional developers and designers have ignored concerns
regarding liability for the products and services they provide. This may
be due in large part to the immunity of non-electronic media, such as books,
to liability laws. However, the increasing use of electronic media as a
delivery instrument is changing the possibilities. Anything delivered through
technical means is considered to more closely resemble a machine and carries
with it increased potential liability.<BR>
<BR>
The issue is further complicated by the continued recognition of the instructional
designer as a professional holding substantial knowledge, skill, and expertise
in his or her field. Many would compare the level of these skills to that
of a engineer, lawyer, or doctor all of whom are professionally registered
and experience considerable liability for their work. This is particularly
true if it can be shown that the professional involved appears to have acted
incompetently in providing the service. There have been a number of suggestions
that IT professionals should be officially tested and certified technically
competent. As the move toward greater professional recognition continues
so will the potential to be held liable increase.<BR>
<BR>
It is the contention of this author that the field of instructional technology
has not yet begun to consider these issues in depth. In the future it will
not be sufficient to merely keep up with the changing nature of the law
for then one is always reacting to rather than anticipating change. Instead,
everyone involved with electronic media should begin a thorough self examination
and start working towards the establishment of agreed standards.<BR>
<BR>
If instructional technology comes to impact education and instruction as
many would predict then increased responsibility will ensue. It is time
that someone begins to answer the questions of what liability should an
electronic media producer have? Should consumers be able to recover damages
for inaccurate information or defective delivery of instruction? What steps
should the field of instructional technology take to regulate the actions
of its members and forestall regulation by lawsuit? Who should be responsible
for incorrect use of electronic instructional media? How should copyright
laws apply to electronic media? When is an electronic modification a new
work? When is it just an illegal copy? What role should instructional technology
play in the resolution of these questions? These questions do not lend themselves
to simple answers. Only through open discussion and examination can valid
answers be arrived at.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Parting Thoughts</B><BR>
<BR>
This paper has discussed many of these issues as they currently stand in
the law books and professional guidelines of organizations such as AECT.
It is apparent that the ethical and legal problems of instructional electronic
media have not been completely dealt with and in fact are just now being
recognized. These questions are here for the foreseeable future. It is time
to stop merely reacting to the problems and to start addressing them. Instructional
technologists are positioned to take the lead in this area if they desire.

<B>Facilitator Manual<BR>
<P><CENTER>Problem To Be Addressed: </B><BR>
<BR>
The proliferation of electronic media throughout the workplace and society
is creating new ethical dilemmas. In many cases the parties involved may
not have previously thought through the implications of their actions and
the possible ramifications these actions might have on others. This is particularly
true in the areas of software copying, electronic capture and modification,
use of networks, computer security, and potential liability for providing
information electronically. This simulation activity has been designed to
promote both individual and group examination of issues related to electronic
media from an ethical and legal perspective.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Specific Objectives:</B><BR>
<BR>
1) To help participants to think through their personal ethical standpoint
on issues related to electronic media.<BR>
<BR>
2) To help participants understand why people copy software or other electronic
media.<BR>
<BR>
3) To help participants understand why they should not copy software and
electronic media.<BR>
<BR>
4) To help participants understand that electronic capture and modification
may not be much different than other forms of copying.<BR>
<BR>
5) To inform the participants of potential legal implications of misusing
electronic media.<BR>
<BR>
6) To inform participants of the growing potential of legal liability for
information or instruction delivered through electronic media.<BR>
<BR>
7) To help participants understand how and why ethical standpoints may differ
depending on the role one plays in an organization.<BR>
<BR>
8) To help participants become aware of the ramifications of their actions
for others.<BR>
<BR>
9) To teach participants to accept the perspectives of others as legitimate.<BR>
<BR>
10) To encourage participants to discuss these and other ethical issues
openly with their peers and supervisors before crises arise.<BR>
<BR>
11) To encourage participants to develop formal standards of ethics for
their organizations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Special Note: </B><BR>
<BR>
The facilitator is encouraged to modify the parameters of the actual simulation
to suit the group(s) participating. The section entitled <B>Modifying Presentation</B>
describes how this might be done. Also this activity may be easily adapted
to topics other than electronic media. The section entitled <B>Adapting
To New Topics</B> at the end of this manual describes how one might do this.
To facilitate this process all materials have been included on the enclosed
IBM PC formatted disk as Microsoft Word 2.0 for Windows files.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Preparation Checklist:</B><BR>
<BR>
1) Review the simulation objectives, materials list, sequence of events,
rules, and debriefing questions. Practice presentation if possible.<BR>
<BR>
2) Assemble materials, copy required number of worksheets, copy evaluation
forms, reserve and test introductory presentation if used.<BR>
<BR>
3) If a large group is expected, try to find volunteers to assist in handing
out the materials and general running of the activity.<BR>
<BR>
4) Decide how many will be in each group and how you will assign groups.
Mark group numbers on worksheets. (<B><CITE>Recommended 4-6 per group</CITE></B>)<BR>
<BR>
5) Reserve room for activity.<BR>
<BR>
6) Allot required time to complete (<B><CITE>This activity requires 1 hour
minimum</CITE></B>).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Materials Required:</B><BR>
<BR>
1) A pencil or pen for every participant.<BR>
<BR>
2) A copy of the Think It Through worksheet for every participant.<BR>
<BR>
3) A chalkboard, flip chart, or overhead projector to tally the results
of the groups.<BR>
<BR>
4) Chalk, magic marker, or overhead marker to use with #3 above.<BR>
<BR>
5) Sufficient space for the large group to break up into smaller groups
of four or five.<BR>
<BR>
6) A writing surface for every participant such as a desk or clipboard.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sequence Of Events:</B><BR>
<BR>
1) Activity introduced to the group. <BR>
<BR>
a) Describe the purpose of the activity.<BR>
<BR>
b) Describe the rules to be followed.<BR>
<BR>
c) Be brief.<BR>
<BR>
d) Be enthusiastic.<BR>
<BR>
e) Explain the fact that there may be no absolute answers.<BR>
<BR>
2) Introductory materials presented to the group such as video, multimedia
presentation, or other example demonstrating some of the issues to be discussed.<BR>
<BR>
3) Hand out Think It Through worksheet to every participant. Explain time
allotted for each part of the simulation activity.<BR>
<BR>
4) Individuals fill out worksheets without discussion. Encourage participants
to take notes or jot down questions to discuss with group. Inform participants
when half the time has past and when it is time to stop. <BR>
<BR>
5) Participants find other members of their small groups and begin discussing.
Inform participants when half the time has past and when it is time to stop.
Observe individual groups and note any interesting behavior in terms of
consensus building or personal beliefs. Diffuse any overly heated discussions
between individuals.<BR>
<BR>
6) Pole groups for answers and tally answers on the display device. Note
reactions of groups when ratings are displayed.<BR>
<BR>
7) Debrief followed by written evaluation by participants.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Debriefing:</B><BR>
<BR>
This portion of the simulation is probably the most important aspect of
the entire activity. As the facilitator you are responsible for guiding
the group through this portion of the activity and will for a large part
determine the extent to which any learning is carried over into the real
world of the participants. <BR>
<BR>
1) Reveal any differences which may have existed in the material presented
to the various groups such as roles, legality, personalization, etc. Examine
how this was reflected in the scores tallied.<BR>
<BR>
2) Invite the participants to talk about the specifics of the activity including
feelings and emotions which occurred when reviewing the scenarios presented.
Clarify any factual questions the group may have. <BR>
<BR>
3) Encourage participants to talk about similar experiences they may have
had in real life.<BR>
<BR>
4) Begin discussion of general questions concerning development of ethical
principles. Draw up list of suggested guidelines from the content of this
activity.<BR>
<BR>
5) Solicit suggestions for other issues which need to be examined in the
future.<BR>
<BR>
6) Mention bibliography of additional information on back of worksheets.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Potential Debriefing Questions:</B><BR>
<BR>
1) How would it feel if someone copied your personal work? <BR>
<BR>
2) Does it matter ethically if the action is legal or illegal?<BR>
<BR>
3) Should education be treated differently than commercial enterprise?<BR>
<BR>
4) Does it matter if there is a human victim?<BR>
<BR>
5) Who should be responsible for enforcing ethical standards?<BR>
<BR>
6) How are ethical standards set in your organization?<BR>
<BR>
7) How can we help others to understand these issues?<BR>
<BR>
8) Should providers of information or instruction be held liable for the
accuracy or use of products?<BR>
<BR>
9) How should ethical violations related to electronic media be punished?<BR>
<BR>
10) Did your personal thinking change during the activity? In what way?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Evaluation:</B><BR>
<BR>
The final part of the simulation is the evaluation. Here, the facilitator
needs to find out whether or not the participants find the activity of value
and discover ways to improve it in the future.(An evaluation is included
in this package)<BR>
<BR>
1) Describe the importance of the evaluation to the participants.<BR>
<BR>
2) Hand out the evaluation questionnaires to all participants.<BR>
<BR>
3) Collect the evaluations as the participants leave.<BR>
<BR>
4) Encourage further discussion privately if anyone interested.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Evaluation Form</B><BR>
Directions: Please answers the following questions as honestly as possible.
The purpose of this evaluation to improve both the simulation and the presentation
of it for future use.<BR>
<BR>
1) Was this activity of value to you? In what way could it be made more
valuable to you personally?<BR>
<BR>
2) What additional issues need to be discussed in the future?<BR>
<BR>
3) Did you like the format of this activity? In what way?<BR>
<BR>
4) How could the facilitator improve his or her presentation of the activity?<BR>
<BR>
5) Additional comments?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rules of Play:</B><BR>
<BR>
1) No sharing among individuals during the first phase of the activity.<BR>
<BR>
2) No sharing among the small groups during the second phase.<BR>
<BR>
3) No criticism of individual opinions. Contrasting opinions may be offered.<BR>
<BR>
4) There are no correct or incorrect answers.<BR>
<BR>
5) No participant may exit until activity completed.<BR>
<BR>
6) There are no winners or losers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Modifying Presentation:</B><BR>
<BR>
This simulation has been designed to allow a number of parameters to be
varied in an effort to tailor the activity to the specific needs of an audience.
Additionally, other situations are described in the section entitled <B>Additional
Scenarios</B> which can be used instead of or in addition to the cases included
in the original charts. Worksheets are included both on the disk and on
paper which can be copied and modified as listed below.<BR>
<BR>
1) Modify the original documents using Microsoft Word 2.0 for Windows and
print new originals for photocopying. (Filename ethsim.doc - page layout
view)<BR>
<BR>
2) Type additions into the spaces provided in the worksheets with blanks.<BR>
<BR>
3) Announce changes to participants before beginning and have them fill
in blanks by hand.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Items which may be easily modified include:</B><BR>
<BR>
1) The time allotted for each phase of the activity.<BR>
<BR>
2) The roles each individual or group are to assume.<BR>
<BR>
3) The inclusion of a statement regarding the legality of the actions described
in the individual scenarios.<BR>
<BR>
4) Personalization to include names of the participants in the scenarios
if known beforehand.<BR>
<BR>
5) The inclusion of other information of importance to the group such as
the relationship of the person taking the action to the participants; i.e.
peer. supervisor, subordinate; the organization in which the action occurs;
etc..<BR>
<BR>
<B>Adapting To New Topics:</B><BR>
<BR>
Additionally, a completely generic version of the worksheets have been included
both on the disk and in paper form which can be adapted to any topic. To
use these forms simply type in the scenarios related to your topic either
in Word 2.0 for Windows or on a typewriter and use the new forms as originals
for the activity. (Filename ethgen.doc - use page layout view)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Additional Scenarios:<BR>
<BR>
Topic - Software copying</B><BR>
<BR>
1) Someone in an organization routinely copies AUTODRAW, a drafting program
retailing for $3495, onto every new personal computer your organization
purchases. The company owns several legitimate copies but considers the
expense too high to purchase for everyone. <BR>
<BR>
2) Someone in an organization routinely copies NView, a screensaver program
retailing for $15, onto every new personal computer your organization purchases.
The company owns several legitimate copies but not enough for every machine.
<BR>
<BR>
3) Several people recently found a particular word processor very useful
for technical writing because of an included equation editor. Realizing
no one would officially provide the software they pooled their money and
bought a single license which they duplicated and distributed among themselves.<BR>
<BR>
4) A professor has found that if everyone in the class uses the same word
processor then all assignments can be turned in electronically and graded
more easily. Consequently, the professor requires all students to use this
program for the class. Knowing the financial plight of most students, free
copies are offered to anyone in the class.<BR>
<BR>
5) Several computer labs have been setup within an organization. Despite
the best attempts of the lab coordinators several pirated copies of popular
programs have appeared on the machines. Many people use these programs at
home and consequently find them easier to work with than what the lab provides.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Topic - Electronic Modification of Media</B><BR>
<BR>
1) An advertising company has created a multimedia presentation comparing
their work to that of their competitors. Routinely this presentation is
shown to new potential clients. The presentation includes recorded television
commercials, scanned photographs, scanned text, and recorded radio snippets.
No attempt was made to obtain copyright release since the material is not
sold.<BR>
<BR>
2) A teacher records a miniseries from television editing the commercials
as she watches. The show will be perfect for what the students will be studying
6 months from now. She feels confident that the students will learn a great
deal from watching the show.<BR>
<BR>
3) As a science project a student records commercial music from her favorite
CD. Using her mother's computer at work she modifies various aspects of
the music to demonstrate the principles of digital signal processing. A
tape of the new music is made and distributed to her friends.<BR>
<BR>
4) The Wall Street Journal is routinely read by nearly everyone in the office.
As a time saver someone decides to scan in the text of articles important
to the company, index them for searching, and copy the text to the file
server for access by everyone in the company.<BR>
<BR>
5) A catchy cover is needed for a new brochure describing a continuing education
course to be offered at the university. A recent demo CD-ROM sent to the
university contains an attractive screen. The screen is captured and small
parts of the image are cutout and modified for the brochure. The brochure
looks completely different then the original image.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Topic - Liability/Responsibility </B><BR>
<BR>
1) A series of aeronautical charts have been designed to aid in the navigation
of small airplanes. Although every effort is made to present the information
in a clear concise manner, many pilots often get confused when trying to
use the charts. One pilot gets lost and crashes as a result. The pilot blames
the producer of the charts.<BR>
<BR>
2) A computer simulation has been designed for use in elementary schools
to teach students about slavery before the civil war. The characters in
the simulation use the language of the time setting. Although extensive
pre-use instructional materials are included to introduce the students to
the activity, one school lets the students begin work without any introduction.
When the students become confused and complain, the producer is blamed.<BR>
<BR>
3) An electronic text is produced describing various edible plants. The
text is intended to be used for cooking purposes and professes the advantages
of natural foods. Unknown to the author a poisonous mushroom is incorrectly
identified as edible in the text. As a result someone gets very sick and
blames the author before the mistake is found.<BR>
<BR>
4) A professor wants to use a videotape in a class which describes various
aspects of the French culture. Included on the tape is a short scene of
nudity consider acceptable in France but not so here. The professor edits
out the scene and shows the tape to the class.<BR>
<BR>
5) Various aspects of an experiment have been recorded to videotape. In
an effort to obtain additional funds for research the tape is edited so
that only the best successful scenes are shown. The tape is then distributed
to various funding agencies for review. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Topic - Electronic Networks</B><BR>
<BR>
1) A number of adults have contacted one another using electronic mail and
setup a bulletin board to exchange sexually explicit images electronically.
The system is secured with passwords so that only those who are members
of the group are allowed access to the images. No one under age is permitted
to view the images.<BR>
<BR>
2) A commercial information service found it necessary to raise prices for
the service. As a result many users began complaining about the increase.
Several particularly vocal opponents were denied further access to the network
and refunded all remaining charges.<BR>
<BR>
3) Electronic chain letters are being passed from user to user across the
campus network. No harm appears to be done since the individuals receiving
the letters are under no obligation to respond.<BR>
<BR>
4) A student graduates and leaves certain files on the campus computer system
pertaining to a research project they had been working on. The advisor of
the student realizes what has happened after the student has left and demands
access to the files. The computer center kindly obliges.<BR>
<BR>
5) Someone posts information to the local electronic bulletin board accusing
another user of being gay. As result, the user accused begins receiving
a large number of harassing electronic mail messages from other users. This
person is required to use the mail system for their job.<BR>

Overview<BR>
<BR>
College and university computer center staff increasingly find themselves
called upon to interpret copyright law, especially as it relates to software,
optical disks and other formats used in multimedia development and classroom
presentations. This document lists several sources of information to help
centers answer faculty and student questions, formulate campus policies,
and build an information collection for dealing with a wide range of copyrighted
materials.<BR>

<H2>Background Information</H2>

<P>Hello, and welcome to my web page. I am from Fort Washington,
Maryland where I have practically lived all of my life. Right now, I
am currently residing in Atlanta where I am a Masters student at
Georgia Tech in the <A HREF="http://www.ece.gatech.edu">College of
Electrical and Computer Engineering</A>. As if that were not enough
to occupy my time, I am also a graduate research assistant in the
<A HREF="http://MiME1.marc.gatech.edu">Multimedia in Manufacturing
Education Center</A>. Some of my favorite past times are sports,
movies, and I really enjoy a good game of spades. If anyone is
interested in getting a game started then drop me a line or two and
we can see what we can do (but no amateurs please, also if you can't

Thad Starner, a grad student at the MIT Media Lab, wears a self-designed computer nearly all the time so he can investigate the advantages of ubiquitous computing.  To learn more about Thad's work, check out the 
<A HREF="http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/">
MIT Wearable Computing</a> page.  In May, 1996, Thad visited the Multimedia in Manufacturing Education lab to see our work in 
<A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/EPSS/">wearable computers and electronic performance support systems
</a>
<br>
<p>
The photo below shows Thad wearing a glasses-mounted display over his left eye and the wearable computer over his right shoulder.

<h1>Tips for using the Search Engine</h1>
</center>
<hr>

<p>
Here is a brief explanation of how to get better results from the IMB and MiME search engine.  If you still have any questions please email the <a href="mailto:gt4751b@prism.gatech.edu">Webmaster</a>.
</p>

<ol>

<li><B>SearchText</B> 
	<ul>
		<li>If this field is not included the search engine will use an empty string for the search. 																This could be done in the case of searching for all pages that were new or modified in the last 		update.
	</ul>
<br>
<li><B>Phonetic</B> 
	<ul>
		<li>This checkbox field turns phonetic searching on if selected. 
	</ul>
<br>
<li><B>andOr</B> and <B>maxHits</B> 
	<ul>
		<li>The <B>andOr</B> popup menu determines if a search is done as an AND search (all) or an OR search (any). If not used, searches default to OR searches.
		<li>The <B>maxHits </B>popup menu determines the maximum hits returned by a search. 
	</ul>
<br>
<li><B>URL, Title and Header</B>
	<ul>
		<li>Each of these checkboxes enables or disables searching inside a particular HTML tag. If one or more of the tags are selected, searching will be constrained to words found inside the selected tags.
	</ul>
<br>
<li><B>Sessions</B>
	<ul>
		<li>Specifying sessions is optional. If no sessions are specified searches are done across all sessions.  We currently only have one session so specifying one is unnecessary.
	</ul>
<br>
<li><B>lastUpdate</B>
	<ul>
		<li>This checkbox field specifies that searches only return references to pages that have been added or modified in the last update.  Updates usually occur once a week.
	</ul>
<br>
<li><B>Details</B>
	<ul>
		<li>This checkbox field specifies if each result line should include the HTML title found with the page as well as the first 250 characters and the URL. If it is not included, results will just contain the HTML title (or the URL if no title was found in the document).
	</ul>
<br>
<li><B>Sorted</B>
	<ul>
		<li>This checkbox field specifies if the results should be sorted by word occurrence. Sorting can slow down the return of results if a large number of pages (&gt;100) are found by the search.
	</ul>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">The goal of the hardware design

was to make a system that was robust, yet easy to trouble-shoot

and repair it the field.  We adopted the philosophy that the controller

was the most important part of the system and should be protected

at all costs.  Along those lines we developed lightning protection

cards to protect all lines going to and from the controller card.

 The idea being that the protection circuitry will be destroyed

in the event of a major power surge thus protecting the controller

card.  The controller card on the other hand will detect the failure

of the lightning protection circuits and alert the user.  A modular

design was chosen to facilitate ease of trouble-shooting and repair.

 A mother-board was designed that provided DC power and connectors

to plug in the other cards.  All the other cards, controller and

lightning protection, plug directly into the mother-board.  In

the event of a failure of one of the boards, it can be un-plugged

and a working board plugged in.  This entire process will only

take a few minutes, thus reducing the down-time of the entire

system.  A block diagram of the system can be seen below, note

that all the cards plug into the mother board.<BR>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">All power to the sensors and the

return  signals from the sensors are lightning protected.  The

temperature sensor is a current device that produces 1 micro-amp

of current for each degree Kelvin.  So at 0o C (273 K) the sensor

produces 273 mico-amps of current.  The sensor is supplied with

a 15VDC source and the resulting current is sent to ground through

a 10k ohm precision resistor, which produces a related voltage.

 At 0o C it would produce 2.73VDC (273 micro-amps x 10000 ohms)

and 100o C would produce a voltage of 3.73 VDC.  This voltage

is filtered with a 0.1 micro-farad capacitor and sent to a 16

to 1 analog multiplexor.  The multiplexor allows the mirco-controller

to select any one of 16 analog inputs to go to the Analog to Digital

converter.  The A/D converter has 12 bits of resolution and operates

on a 0 - 10 Volt range, which gives a resolution of 2.44 milli-volts

per bit.  The micro-controller uses the digitized value to determine

the current temperature.<BR>

<P>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">The relative humidity sensor is

a voltage device that is powered with 15VDC and returns a value

between 0 and 10 volts.  This value is sent to an input on the

analog multiplexor.<BR>

<B><FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">3.1.4 Lightning Protection<BR>

</FONT></B>

<P>

Lightining and other induced electrical noise usually manifests

itself as a high frequency, high energy electrical signal, which

is very destructive to computer circuitry.  Current Farm Computer

Systems use and electrical surge suppressor on the incomming AC

line.  Most do not protect the data lines and those that do use

fuses for protection.  The idea being that the fuse will blow

and protect the system from damage.  Our research shows that fuses

do not blow fast enough to protect the system, and substansial

damage can be done before they blow.  Our protection system is

shown in the diagram below:<BR>

<BR>

<P>

<IMG SRC="IMG00003.GIF"><BR>

<BR>

<P>

The circuit above uses a double edged approach to remove electrical

surges.  We define a surge to be any voltage greater than 15 volts,

and both the Spark Gap and Transzorb will short to ground any

signal greater that 15 volts.  The Spark Gap has the capability

of shorting large amounts of current to ground, and is used to

remove most of the energy in the surge signal.  The Spark Gap

suffers from a slow response time to an incomming surge, so the

Inductor is used to block most of the high frequency signal allowing

the Spark Gap time to fire.  The Inductor will only allow low

frequency signals to pass through it, and those signals will be

shorted to ground by the Transzorb.  Transzorb's have a very fast

response time to an incomming surge but can not handle high energy

signals.  The Transzorb's job is to short to ground any low frequency

surges that make it pass the Spark Gap before it has a chance

to fire.<BR>

<P>

The IBM or compatible PC system is used to collect data from up

to fifty different controllers and save the data to disk.  Figure

4 shows a typical farm layout, with sensor positions and cable

runs.  The system will display the data graphically to the user

and allow him to see the current status in each house.  The user

is also able to change the setpoints and set the fan timers in

each house.  The PC provides access to the controller information,

to remote users via a modem.  The system will allow valid users

to log onto the system from a modem and monitor the status of

each house.  Remote users are not allowed to change any of  the

system parameters, but they are permitted to download data on

the system performance.  A detailed description of the software

operation on the PC can be found in Apendix A.<BR>

<FONT FACE="NewCenturySchlbk">Communication between the controller

and the PC is done over fiber-optic lines.  This eliminates the

run outside between buildings.  The fiber-optic cables are used

to connect each house controller to a centrally located PC that

monitors and collects data from the controllers.<BR>

alarm consists of a dual thermostat that detects when the temperature

goes above a high temperature value, or below a low temperature

value and activates the alarm.  The alarm system also monitors

the status of the controller by using a ten second pulse generated

by the controller.  The pulse is used to activate a mono-stable

multivibrator that keeps a relay energized as long as a pulse

occurs every ten seconds.  The ten second pulse is generated by

the controller if it is operating correctly,  if the controller

stops operating for any reason the pulses will stop and the alarm

will sound.  The alarm will also sound if there is a loss of power,

or if the mono-stable multivibrator or relay fail.<BR>

<h1>Electronic Performance Support System</h1>
<br>
<h2>Research Focus</h2>
<p>
The goal of this research is to develop better ways of providing real-time training and performance support for plant personnel.  (Real-time means making information available at the time and place it is needed.)  The <A 
HREF="http://www.gtri.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech Research
Institute</A> team in the <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/MiME/">Multimedia in Manufacturing Education laboratory</A> is developing an electronic performance support system (EPSS) that workers can use on the job, anywhere in the plant.  An EPSS uses technology to integrate
procedures, information, and tools to help users perform a task.  An EPSS
gives its users the information the users need to perform a task as they
actually perform the task.  The target users for our system are supervisory and maintenance personnel.  (For more information on EPSSs, see our symposium handout titled <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/mime/papers/training96_handout.html">"Glancing ahead: Advanced technology"</A> or our papers titled <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/mime/papers/edmedia1l.html">"Building a demonstration multimedia electronic performance support system"</A>, and <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/mime/papers/Boeing.html">"Using a wearable computer for industrial data collection and performance support."</A>)
<h2>Background and Challenges</h2>
<p>
The equipment and processes used in plants, such as food processing plants, are becoming more complex and dynamic.  Maintaining and managing plants requires a strong knowledge base and timely information.  Training can supplement these needs.  However, research has proven that training is more effective when trainees have a chance to practice what they have learned.  Plant maintenance and management tasks often are done too infrequently to reinforce training.  Real-time support can provide workers immediately with necessary information (such as equipment manuals, repair histories, and emergency procedures), thereby  supporting and reinforcing training.
<p>
A real-time support system also can be a useful tool in keeping a plant running smoothly on a day-to-day basis.  Floor managers often need access to information from other areas of the plant to make decisions; yet that information may not be readily available when they need it.  An EPSS can help provide information immediately, giving the manager the latest operations data from anywhere in the plant.
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
We are working on a specialized EPSS that we call <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/imb/projects/fast.html">factory automation support technology (FAST)</A>.  The system is designed for use in a manufacturing or plant environment.  Developing a system like FAST is a two-part process.  One part is gathering and preparing the required information for use in an EPSS.  The other part is developing a delivery system for that information.  Our research team has placed the most emphasis on developing the delivery system.
<p>
A system like FAST must provide information when and where it is needed.  The best way to deliver information immediately is to have the worker carry or wear the delivery system.  But if the system gets in the way or is uncomfortable, the worker won't use it.  Our research team has developed an interactive, wearable system that provides information through a variety of means, yet leaves the worker's hands free and does not interfere with vision or hearing.  (For more information on FAST, see our papers titled <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/mime/papers/icls96.html">"Factory Automated Support Technology"</A> and <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/mime/papers/edmedia2.html">"FAST: A research paradigm for educational performance
support 
systems"</A>.  For more information on wearable computers, see the 
<A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/wearable_computing/">Georgia Tech wearable computing information Web page</A> or the 
<A HREF="http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/">MIT wearable computing Web page</A>.)
<p>
We built <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/EPSS/three_wearables.gif">several generations</A> of wearable computers.  We applied what we learned in one generation to improve the next generation.  Our <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/EPSS/gen1/gen1.html/">first-generation wearable computer</A> was designed primarily to show potential users what technology was available at that time.  In our <A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/EPSS/gen2/gen2.html/">second-generation wearable computer</A>, we moved the computer to the back and used a different cursor positioning and selection device.  
<p>
Our third generation wearable computer includes the following components:
<ul>
<li>Computer with:
<ul>
<li>Credit card-sized (PCMCIA) motherboard
<li>Intel 486 chip running at 75 MHz with 16 MB of RAM
<li>500 MB hard drive
<li>SVGA video controller
<li>16 bit sound
<li>Wireless network
<li>Voice recognition software
<li>Windows95 operating system
<li>Video send/receive software (optional)
</ul>
<li>Monochrome VGA-resolution head-mounted display
<li>Noise cancelling microphone
<li>Earphone
<li>Nickel metal hydride battery packs
<li>Monochrome VGA-resolution head-mounted camera (optional).
</ul>

The user wears the comuter on an adjustable belt.  With the wireless network, the user can enter and receive information wherever the user goes.  The head-mounted display allows the user to look at information on the computer display without blocking the user's forward view of the real world.  The microphone and voice recognition software allow the user to control the computer while keeping the user's hands free to perform other tasks.  We designed our wearable computer system to provide a wide variety of information to the user, including text, graphics, photographs, videos, narration, and sounds.
<p>
To provide power to the computer system, we built 
special nickel metal hydride battery packs.  Figure 3 shows one battery pack.  Each pack can be bent slightly to fit comfortably on the user's hips.  To protect the batteries, we sealed them in neoprene.  The packs are easy to replace and one pack can be replaced while the computer is running.  Two battery packs provide over four hours of power for the entire system.

<p>
Our wearable computer system can be used to allow the wearer to send video and audio to a person in a remote location.  That way, two people can work together even though they are physically far apart.  The user can point the head-mounted camera at a broken piece of equipment and send the video nearly instantly to an expert in another location.  The expert can watch what the user is doing and send auditory instructions to help the user to repair the broken equipment.  Figures 4 and 5 show the head-mounted camera attached to another one of our head-mounted displays.

We continue to make innovations in wearable computer technology.  We adapted a monochrome head-mounted display to provide VGA-quality color at a reasonable cost. 
We are also developing a unique power management system that maximizes battery life and provides battery status to the user.  Finally, we are integrating one of the new, commercially available wearable computers into our system.  Figure 8 shows a wearable computer from Computing Devices International.

<h2>Future Directions</h2>
<p>
We plan to work with a food processing plant in Georgia to develop two or three realistic applications for the improved FAST system.  Possible applications include support for quality control data collection or assistance with environmental auditing.  We will take our system into the plant to develop and test the pilot applications.  Figure 9 (below) shows a food processing plant quality assurance inspector wearing our first-generation prototype computer with noise-reducing earphones.

<H2>Project Description</H2>
This focus of this project is on developing interactive learning systems for use in manufacturing education both at Georgia Tech and within industry.  Specific projects will be identified through a team approach of students, faculty, industry, and designers.  Our current ideas revolve around design education employing case histories and interactive simulation.<P>

Our foundation for these efforts is based on the belief that learning is a constructive process in which the learner builds a personal representation of the world around him or her.  This internal construction occurs primarily through experience that is ideally situated in rich context.  It is our intention to employ technology to create greater opportunities for students to experience the real context of manufacturing systems and thus encourage transfer and connection of classroom based instruction to the real world.

<A NAME="intro"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>
Traditional classroom based engineering education often falls short of preparing students for the complete process of manufacturing -- that is the complete cycle of design, engineering, production, marketing, and delivery of goods.  Some of these shortfalls include:<P>


*	Restricted access to practicing manufacturing experts because of the high cost of bringing them to the classroom, limited individual availability, and the logistical impossibility of actual plant visits.<P>


*	Curriculum demands which do not permit the inclusion of rapidly emerging issues such as open engineering systems, environmentally aware manufacturing, or information enabled manufacturing.<P>
<p>
*	Few opportunities to experience or participate in an actual manufacturing process first hand while in school.
<p>
We propose to address the above shortfalls through rapid development and deployment of a technology enabled curriculum (TEC).  Advanced media technologies will be exploited to create virtual, time shifted, and/or remote visits to real world manufacturing systems.  Through the power of interactive multimedia and advanced telecommunications students will be enabled to directly participate as members of actual engineering design teams while remaining at school.

Our foundation for these efforts is based on the belief that learning is a constructive process in which the learner builds a personal representation of the world around him or her.  This internal construction occurs primarily through experience which is ideally situated in rich context.  It is our intention to employ technology to create greater opportunities for students to experience the real context of manufacturing systems and thus encourage the transfer and connection of classroom based instruction to the real world.<P>

	
Exploitation of advanced information technology for engineering education at the university level has been limited to date even though a great deal of research has confirmed the advantages of such an approach.  The few attempts which have been made for engineering education in general remain focused on specific disciplines such as physics, electrical engineering, or mechanics.  This program represents the first attempt to apply interactive educational technology across a complete multidisciplinary engineering curriculum .  This project proposes to leap-frog traditional instructional methods and create the infrastructure and resources necessary to assure engineering/manufacturing education remains at the forefront of innovation.  Many experts believe that life-long self-paced learning through interactive media represents the future.  We propose to lead the way in engineering/manufacturing education.<P>

	
In short, our goal is to revolutionize the engineering/manufacturing educational process on a local and eventually national level through the exploitation of the latest advances in instructional technology, learning theory, and multimedia systems.  Our approach radically reaches forward to focus on the rapid development and deployment of learner-centered technology enabled curriculum materials throughout the entire engineering/manufacturing curriculum.<P>



<A NAME="ap"><H3>Activities Planned</H3></A><P>

	
Three main activities are proposed in this program: the creation of a manufacturing focused multimedia development resource, rapid infusion of educational technology into the manufacturing curriculum, and the production and dissemination of interactive courseware.  Much of the infrastructure is already in place at Georgia Tech necessary to realize these goals including appropriate personnel, specialized hardware and software, management system, and commitment to multimedia based instruction.  What is needed is an interdisciplinary campus wide effort focused specifically on the needs of manufacturing education.  MIME will serve as the focal point for such an effort.<P>

	
Initial projects to be undertaken will be closely linked with new and existing degree programs across the entire campus.  Curriculum needs of these programs will drive all research and development efforts.  The first task to be undertaken will focus on conducting a thorough needs analysis of manufacturing education and subsequently identifying those needs which can be best met through technology.  Or goal is for real learning needs to drive the technology rather than the technology driving the learning.<P>



<A NAME="ctme"><H3>Commitment To Manufacturing Education</H3></A><P>

	
Georgia Tech (GT) has a long history of involvement in manufacturing engineering education.  Recently, GT was ranked as the number one university in manufacturing education by U.S.  News & World Reports.  This achievement was made possible by an across the board commitment of the administration and the State of Georgia to focus on manufacturing education and research and development.  In November of 1991 the $15 million, 120,000 square foot Manufacturing Research Center was officially opened.  Funding for the project continues to come from a combination of state and industry matching funds.  An additional $40 million Manufacturing Related Disciplines Complex dedicated to manufacturing education is schedule to begin construction in the near future.  GT also serves as a model in industry/university partnering through its multi-university/industry Material Handling Research Center (MHRC) and Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems (CIMS) graduate certificate program.<P>

	
Through these programs Georgia Tech has over ten years of experience in interdisciplinary manufacturing related education. The CIMS program continues to serve as the focus for these efforts awarding over 500 graduate certificates to date. Current enrollment stands at approximately 200 and involves 25% of the faculty across nine academic units. This program continues to be funded through a consortia of industry representatives and will serve as a solid foundation for future efforts such as this proposal.<P>



<A NAME="in"><H3>Innovativeness</H3></A><P>

	
Exploitation of advanced information technology for manufacturing education at the university level has been virtually non-existent to date even though a great deal of research has confirmed the advantages of such an approach.  The few attempts which have been made for engineering education in general remain focused on specific disciplines such as physics, electrical engineering, or mechanics.  MIME represents the first attempt to apply interactive educational technology across a complete multidisciplinary curriculum such as manufacturing.  This project proposes to leap-frog traditional instructional methods and create the infrastructure and resources necessary to assure manufacturing education remains at the forefront of innovation.  Many experts believe that life-long self-paced learning through interactive media represents the future.  We propose to lead the way in manufacturing education.<P>

	
Another innovation lies in our intention to make all materials produced available for low-cost delivery.  We intend to exploit recent advancements in consumer oriented playback systems to ensure that required hardware investments do not limit the acceptance and rapid dissemination of the materials produced.  A hierarchical delivery model is planned whereby emerging multimedia standards are employed to allow creation of interactive courseware which allows increasing levels of user interactivity depending on the capabilities of the host platform.  In this way initial materials can developed rapidly, released for immediate use, and later enhanced as the technology evolves and time permits.<P>



<A NAME="tp"><H3>Target Populations</H3></A><P>

	
Realizing that many defense workers may be unable directly attend a university, a remote instructional delivery mechanism is required.  Multimedia-based instruction by its' digital nature offers new opportunities to address remote, distant, or otherwise restricted populations such as this.  By focusing entirely on electronic delivery all materials will be immediately available for study at defense industry locations at the convenience of the students.  By coordinating and integrating materials development with new and existing manufacturing curriculums it will be possible to offer academic credit for completed coursework.  Initial demonstration projects include a focus on the needs of students returning to school from the defense industry.  At least one project will provide a means to identify specific areas of expertise for which advanced placement or credit may be appropriate as well as to deliver refresher material.  In this manner defense engineers will receive maximum credit for their work experience while also creating a study plan tailored to their specific needs and interests.
	Currently Georgia Tech stands as the national leader in awarding engineering degrees to women, second behind the University of Puerto Rico in awarding engineering degrees to underrepresented minorities, and behind only Howard and North Carolina AT&T in awarding engineering degrees to African Americans.  Such diversity offers tremendous opportunity to attract members of underrepresented minorities into manufacturing engineering as a career.<P>


Equally important is the recruitment of women and members of underrepresented minority groups into the manufacturing profession.  Graduate students from these groups will be actively recruited and special attention will be placed on their retention.  Also, one of our collaborators, Dr. Erika Rogers, is a faculty member at Clark Atlanta University, one of the nation's prominent black universities.  One aspect of that collaboration will be to facilitate graduate recruitment from CAU's student population.  We will also make a special effort in the creation of electronic materials (e.g., multimedia-based video interviews and images) to represent a cross-section of the nation's population, including women and people of color. <P>



<A NAME="ii"><H3>Industry Involvement</H3></A><P>

	
Industry will be actively involved in all phases of this program through existing partnerships already in place at Georgia Tech.  These alliances include major manufacturing companies which are currently committing significant financial and personnel resources to manufacturing related programs at Georgia Tech.  Industry advisory board members from both the CIMS program and the MARC program will serve as both as project reviewers and field participants as required.<P>



<A NAME="mdt"><H3>Multi-Disciplinary Teams</H3></A><P>

	
It is anticipated that faculty from nearly every department on campus will have a stake in this program either as a developer or user of materials developed under this program.  Faculty from the schools of mechanical, electrical, industrial, and civil engineering have already expressed interest in participating in the activities of MIME.  Additional faculty from architecture, literature culture and communication, and the college of computing have also expressed a desire to play a role.  Exact participants will be identified through an assessment process whereby real learning needs are identified.  Manufacturing by its' very nature requires a broad multi-disciplinary approach as evidenced by campus wide CIMS certificate program already in existence.<P>



<A NAME="pi"><H3>Problem Identified</H3></A><P>

	
Manufacturing by its' vary nature is a broad multidisciplinary field requiring general knowledge of the entire enterprise including the design, production, and delivery of finished products.  The manufacturing engineer requires knowledge from the diverse fields of robotics, materials, CAD/CAM, communication systems, budgeting, management, continuous quality improvement, and training the workforce.  Integrating this knowledge is a formidable task requiring a balance of technical depth with a broad understanding of the problems facing industry.  Equally important is an understanding of the collaborative team-oriented approach of real-world problem solving.<P>

	
Today, it is nearly impossible to provide a student with the required breadth of experience required while including time for in-depth study of any emerging issues.  Often decisions have to be made to limit the classroom time spent studying any particular topic.  As a result, little time is left for students to connect what they hear in the classroom with the real manufacturing world.  What is needed is a new instructional medium which allows the students to interact with real world manufacturing issues in an off-line, out of class manner without the presence of an instructor.  Students need experience applying the concepts presented in the classroom before they reach the actual manufacturing floor.<P>

	
Additionally, changing pressures in society continually present new issues which should be dealt with during the educational experience.  Examples of such issues include manufacturing ethics, environmentally friendly production processes, interactive consumer technologies and their effect on production, team building, rapid prototype design, self-directed work groups, and the life-long training of the workforce to name a few.  Current curriculum constraints simply do not permit all of these topics to be covered in the traditional classroom; yet, many of these exact topics have been identified as issues crucial to the future success of American manufacturing.  <P>
Finally, education is undergoing a technological revolution of its' own as many educators search for ways to enhance learning through the wise application of interactive information systems.  Surprisingly, much of this effort to date has not occurred in higher education even though many universities are better equipped technology wise than their lower grade counterparts.  In particular, the literature is almost completely free of attempts to incorporate interactive learning technology into manufacturing education.<P>


Recently McDermott (1993) summed many of the shortcomings of traditional classroom based technical education with the following list of observations on teaching and learning:<P>



*	Ability to solve standard quantitative problems is not adequate criterion of functional understanding.  Even though the criterion for functional understanding is often measured by the ability of a student to solve quantitative problems, there is little correlation between this type of performance and the ability to solve real-world previously unencountered problems.<P>


*	Traditional instruction does not generally produce a coherent conceptual framework in students for relating a number of concepts.   To apply a concept in a variety of contexts students must not only be able to define the concept but equally important they must be able to relate it to associated concepts while differentiating it from others.<P>


*	Many conceptual misunderstandings are not overcome by traditional instruction.  Instead, students must be challenged multiple times to resolve their misunderstandings.  They need time and opportunity to apply the same concepts in many contexts, to reflect upon their experience and to generalize from the results.<P>


*	Traditional instruction does not usually result in growth of general reasoning ability.  Often students perceive a topic as a collection of facts and formulas and do not recognize the critical role of reasoning in applying this information.  They are unlikely to change unless the course material is presented such that this ability is cultivated.<P>


*	Connections between concepts, formal representations, and the real world are often lacking at the conclusion of traditional instruction.  Students need repeated practice in applying their conceptual knowledge to the real world.<P>


*	Teaching by telling, traditional lecture, is an ineffective means of instruction for most students.  Instead, every student must become an active participant in his or her education.  No matter how accomplished a lecturer might be, meaningful learning will not occur if students are not intellectually active and involved in what they are studying.<P>


	
Educating the next generation of manufacturing engineers through traditional educational techniques alone exaggerates all of the above problems and concerns.  For manufacturing is ultimately concerned with using real live processes and equipment to create real products. The effective manufacturing engineer must develop a strong conceptual link between what he or she hears in the classroom and what really goes on in the real world.  <P>


 

<A NAME="oebwm"><H3>Overcoming Educational Barriers With Multimedia</H3></A><P>
 
	
Obviously educational change is needed.  Many have hailed interactive multimedia as the saving grace of education in the United States.  Interactive multimedia is revolutionizing the way people work, communicate, and most importantly learn.  By combining text, graphics, animation, simulation, sound, and video multimedia applications engage people from multiple perspectives by touching many senses at one time.  Additionally, since the technology is computer based, this new medium offers rich interactive capabilities previously unavailable in any communication medium.  Although a variety of delivery systems are available the typical interactive multimedia platform is based on industry standard computers connected to a number of media sources such as CD-ROM, CDI, DVI, videodisc, interactive television, or a network link.  Hardware systems capable of supporting interactive applications are becoming readily available throughout business, campus communities and increasingly the home.<P>

	
Research has shown that people differ considerably in the manner they learn best.  Some respond to highly structured presentations, others prefer free-form exploration.  Some people are highly visually oriented while others are best served through auditory presentation.  Suffice it to say that no two individuals possess the exact same learning style.  Interactive multimedia allows the student to select that form of presentation which suits him or her individually.  It has been said that people remember:<P>


<EM>	20% of what they see,<P>

	
40% of what they see and hear,<P>

	
70% of what they see, hear, and do
</EM><P>


Interactive multimedia provides a medium which takes maximum advantage of the way people learn by offering opportunities to do all of the above.<P>


Instructionally sound application of this new media offers a cost-effective method to relieve many of the bottlenecks in manufacturing education discussed.  Research has shown that delivering instruction through multimedia learning typically occurs 38-70% faster than through traditional teaching methods.  Additionally, learners show significant gains in understanding, transference to the real world, and long-term retention. Finally, the digital nature of the technology allows an instructor to rapidly incorporate current events and issues into the curriculum in near real time.<P>

	 
Many institutions experimenting with this new educational tool have discovered that other positive side-effects result from its' use.  Multimedia delivery of instruction forces the students to take greater responsibility for his or her learning than traditional classroom based instruction.  This occurs due to the self-paced self-directed nature of the medium.  As a result, the technology becomes a catalyst to true educational reform whereby the teacher assumes the role of coach and mentor rather than sole information provider. In the end many students experience significant increases in motivation and go on to seek out material beyond the requirements of a class.<P>

	
 	
Another advantage this new instructional media offers is the power of interactivity with people, events, and systems which are otherwise unavailable to the average student.  For example consider the case of a seminar with Dr. Edward's Deeming the renowned expert on quality.  Few people ever have the opportunity to interact with him personally.  Interactive multimedia could be used to simulate such an interaction allowing a student to compose his or her own questions to explore with Dr. Deeming.  Through the power of interactive video technology a response could be selected from an indexed collection of similar questions and a short video of Dr. Deeming responding to the question displayed.  Or suppose a teacher is discussing new electronics assembly procedures for surface mount devices.   Traditional instruction would offer a reference to a recent article on the subject.  The technology enabled curriculum might instead provide an exploratory hypermedia reference document which allows the student to search a number of articles, view both still and motion video of the actual process, and electronically store an indexed set of notes for later recall.<P>

	
In summary, the benefits of interactive multimedia applicable to a practice oriented manufacturing curriculum include:<P>



*	Per user cost of delivery reduced over lifetime of course.<P>


*	Overall mastery of subject material substantially increased.<P>


*	Remote delivery possible.<P>


*	Access as needed rather than when provided.<P>


*	Significant reduction in time to master subject matter.<P>

*	Collaborative design and development required.<P>


*	Realistic simulation of actual manufacturing processes possible.<P>


*	Rapid update and inclusion of current material.<P>


*	Consistent presentation of subject matter regardless of instructor.<P>


*	Rapid widespread distribution through electronic networks.<P>




<A NAME="mime"><H2>Multimedia in Manufacturing Education (MIME)</H2></A><P>
<p>	
Why then has higher education not endorsed multimedia-based instruction with open arms?  In fact many institutions are attempting to do just that; however, the development of quality engaging courseware has proven to require a completely new approach to teaching as well as new technical skills.  Interactive multimedia development differs dramatically from traditional text or note preparation.  Literature abounds with well intentioned examples of multimedia projects which succeed technically demonstrating the latest bells and whistles of interactive video, digital teleconferencing, or high speed networking yet fail to instruct in a meaningful way.  Clearly more than just technology expertise is needed.  Clearly the problem involves more than just hardware and software.  Many faculty are eager to take advantage of multimedia but do not possess the time, skill, knowledge, or resources to do so.  Help is needed.    <p>	
In order to realize the full potential of interactive multimedia for manufacturing education we propose to create a national resource dedicated to rapidly producing manufacturing related multimedia-based courseware which is tightly integrated with existing multidisciplinary manufacturing education programs.  This resource will be staffed with a renaissance team of professionals dedicated solely to maximizing the effectiveness of multimedia based education.  Coupled with extensive evaluation and research such a program offers the potential to significantly enhance manufacturing education on a national level.<p>	
This resource center will be known as MIME (Multimedia In Manufacturing Education), a multimedia courseware research and development organization dedicated to meeting the needs of interdisciplinary manufacturing education including:<p><p>
*	Enhancement of new and existing manufacturing curricula through the addition of self-paced non-traditional interactive educational software.<p>
*	Creation of the infrastructure necessary to deliver manufacturing related course material on-site at defense industry facilities through self-study interactive courses.<p>
*	Supporting faculty in the creation and use of educational technologies for manufacturing education.<p>
*	Teaching future manufacturing engineers how to use multimedia technology to train the future workforce and communicate effectively.<p>
*	Demonstration of the effectiveness of learning theory centered multimedia-based instruction across the entire manufacturing education curriculum.<p>
*	Improving the effectiveness of interactive media-based engineering instruction in general.  <p>
*	Providing a dedicated multimedia production facility for manufacturing related courseware development.  <p>
*	Addressing the individual needs of various groups of students regardless of their backgrounds.<p>
*	Increasing the opportunity to build interpersonal team skills.<p>
*	Focusing on development of process oriented higher order problem solving skills development.<p><p>	
Specifically, we propose to create a dedicated resource center staffed by a small number of professionals skilled in the design, development, and evaluation of learner-centered interactive multimedia.  This staff will then work with groups of graduate students and faculty to implement a demonstration set of manufacturing related curricular materials employing multimedia in an instructionally sound and consistent manner.  Once completed, the educational materials will be disseminated widely and lessons learned will be shared with other institutions.<p> 	
An investment in research to advance the current capabilities of interactive multimedia technology is also planned.  One of the limitations of current multimedia systems for education, however, is that they emphasize a ``browsing'' paradigm.  That is, they are designed primarily to allow the user to navigate through subject-related resource material in an engaging and informative manner.  A more powerful use of this technology is to embed it in an intelligent tutoring system designed for the manufacturing curriculum.  <p>
Such a program would pose interactive problem-solving situations appropriate to the level of the student, and assist him/her in the completion of graded assignments.  The advantages of such an approach are many.  The use of stand-alone technology allows the student to work at his/her own pace.  However, more importantly, the development of such an intelligent multimedia tutor allows students to work on a large variety of real-world manufacturing problems, without requiring the physical presence of the instructor.<p>	The program would not only present questions, and supplementary resource materials, but, through its intelligent interaction, would help to guide the student through the reasoning process, giving advice, or redirecting the student's focus-of-attention at appropriate times. The nature of the student's errors or misunderstandings would guide the type of assistance provided, and the system would employ its multimedia capabilities in a manner that would be most helpful to the student at the time. <p>	
In order to provide a mechanism to assist and enhance the student's learning experience with this type of technology, it is important to have a strong cognitive foundation.  Since multimedia emphasizes visual information as well as text-based information, it is important to understand the relationship between the student's perceptual and problem-solving capabilities, and how to exploit this knowledge to present information in a manner which leads to improved student performance.  This suggests two needs:  1) a methodology for quickly extracting information about how students learn this particular type of material and 2) a mechanism for easily incorporating the resultant knowledge into an intelligent tutoring system.  	<p>	
Both of these needs can be addressed to a great extent by research which has already been conducted in building a Visual Interaction Assistance system (VIA, Rogers, 1992).   This system was designed to provide intelligent assistance in a visual reasoning task, and is based on a cognitive model of the interaction between perception and problem-solving employed in such a task.  Although VIA emphasizes actual problem-solving rather than teaching problem-solving, the experimental methodology developed for collecting and analyzing protocol data, the cognitive model itself, and the blackboard-style design of the system provide solid foundations for extension to an intelligent multimedia tutoring environment. <p> 

<A NAME="ci"><H3>Curriculum Integration</H3></A><p>	
To achieve any measure of success the products of MIME must be designed as integral components of the manufacturing curriculum.  The creation of the new product realization degree program at Georgia Tech coupled with the existing experience in manufacturing education offers an unusual opportunity to meet this goal.  As teams of interdisciplinary faculty meet and design the new courses required for these programs, MIME representatives will work as active members of the same teams.  Projects will be formalized employing multimedia technology to best meet the instructional objectives/needs of particular courses rather than to simply demonstrate the power of the technology.  This will insure that the maximum benefit of the technology is achieved as well as provide an opportunity for the instructors to buy into the concept of Technology Enabled Curriculum (TEC).  <p>	
In order to insure that the instructional materials produced match the needs of the curriculum the following instructional systems design (ISD) iterative model will be used in creating the multimedia materials:<p>	
This model consists of five interrelated phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation.  The dotted lines show that the process is iterative in nature and not a completely linear process.  As the instructional system progresses the designer must move back and forth among the various phases of development.  The lines from the evaluation phase lead to all other phases such that adjustments are made to the course where needed.  Just as for any system to work well all of its' parts must be compatible and work towards the same goal, so must instructional programs. Taking a systems approach to instructional development will ensure that all the parts of the curriculum function as a dynamic integrated whole.<p> 

<A NAME="dopt"><H3>Description of Project Tasks</H3></A><p>	
A phased approach to the problem is planned consisting of first assembling the necessary dedicated resources.  Second, work will begin on the development of an initial demonstration application while working with curriculum committees to identify additional projects.  Third, an assessment and evaluation of the completed demonstrations and the development process will be conducted.  As a final phase we will begin to disseminate the materials to other institutions and produce a plan for continued efforts.<p><p>

<A NAME="p1"><H4>Phase 1 - Resource Coordination - Needs Assessment</H4></A><p>	
The initial phase of this program will consist of assembling the necessary resources which must be dedicated to MIME.  This effort will mainly consist of outfitting a small development laboratory with the hardware and software necessary to produce the instructional multimedia materials.  This will include at least two separate development stations, a desktop video editing facility, a color flat bed scanner, video/audio digitization hardware, audio editing hardware and software, appropriate recording equipment, graphics, digital photo, and digital video editing software, and a multi-platform authoring package such as Authorware Professional or Director.  The emphasis will be on developing only that capability which must be dedicated to this effort.  Specialized imaging or animation workstations are available in other locations across campus.  Since the need for access to this type of high end equipment will be intermittent, we do not intend to duplicate such resources.  <p>	
Although much of the equipment required to produce the multimedia materials are already available at different locations throughout Georgia Tech, none are dedicated to manufacturing education. Experience has shown that shared access works well for small efforts; however, the mission of MIME mandates a core of dedicated resources.<p>	
Our goal is to develop materials which can be easily distributed to other locations throughout the country and require a minimal investment in multimedia hardware to run.  Additionally, we hope to serve as a model for other institutions in showing the way to develop instructional multimedia with only small investments in additional infrastructure.  Our intention is to exploit the capabilities of multimedia technology without limiting future access because of unrealistic playback hardware expectations and/or requirements.<p>	
Additionally, we will conduct a thorough learning needs assessment of manufacturing education with input from students, alumni, faculty, and industry.  From this information we will identify specific learning needs best addressed  through interactive multimedia.  Only after this assessment is complete will we begin working on specific projects.<p> 

<A NAME="p2"><H4>Phase 2 - Demonstration Applications</H4></A><p>	
The next phase of the program will consist the of identifying and producing the first demonstration application.  Initially, a number of targeted projects are imagined to demonstrate the effectiveness of this innovative approach to manufacturing education:<p><p>
*	Infusion of manufacturing Experts Into The Classroom (EITC) through case-based presentation and dialogue with leading manufacturing engineers discussing real world issues.  This will allow the normal seminar type course to be delivered remotely as needed and in greater depth as normal time constraints are extended.<p>
*	Development of interactive pre-assessment and refresher materials to be used at defense industry sites by experienced engineers returning to graduate school.<p>
*	Interactive practice oriented case studies of contemporary manufacturing issues such as environmental awareness, ethical practice, and self-directed work teams.<p>
*	Simulated interactive design review and evaluation using intelligent virtual characters and interactive video.<p>
*	Computer enabled design collaboration using the new high tech media enabled classroom described in the companion proposal.<p>	
EITC interactive case study development is envisioned as the initial project undertaking.  We choose to focus on this area for a number of reasons: 1) a broad cross curriculum immediate need for this type of material, 2) potential for rapid access to the needed experts through existing corporate partners with Georgia Tech, 3) availability of supporting media resources from the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME).  As part of this project we propose to work with the SME to adapt much of their large existing instructional film library to an interactive format and to update it with new material developed as part of this program.  This will not be a simple conversion of one media to another.  Instead, the real advancement will come from maximizing the interactivity of the presentation and the inclusion of in-depth supporting materials.  The focus will be on explicitly defining the connection between the concepts taught in the classroom and their real world application.   <p>
As a first step it is imagined that the initial release of this material will be designed for minimal playback hardware requirements.  The recent introductions of consumer oriented technologies such as Compact Disc Interactive (CDI), PhotoCD, and SegaCD offer to drastically lower the cost of delivery and hence the barriers to widespread use of educational multimedia.  A side benefit to the  consumerization of multimedia has been the advent of the first true multi-platform delivery standards such as MPEG-1 for digital motion video,  (CDI) for combining CD quality audio with interactive graphics and digital video, and the rapid acceptance of the low-cost SegaCD home gaming system.  As part of our effort to obtain matching funds we will explore formal relationships with many multimedia providers.   <p>	
All other project formulations will be made in conjunction with interdisciplinary curriculum development teams.  History has shown that very little if any improvement in education will result from the use of technology if the development is done without the direct faculty involvement.<p>

<A NAME="p3"><H4>Phase 3 - Evaluation/Assessment</H4></A><p>	
Many educators have accepted the notion that multimedia automatically increases learning by its' very nature.  Many commercial products extol the advantages of learning with multimedia and virtually guarantee increased comprehension, reduced learning time, and greater motivation for any subject presented with multimedia.  Obviously this notion is overly simplistic. Reeves (1992) states, " Interactive Multimedia cannot guarantee learning any more than a library in a school can guarantee learning."   Although this new instructional media offers truly revolutionary   capabilities it is only through intelligent design and execution will learning be enhanced.  <p>	
As part of this overall program it is necessary to evaluate/assess the multimedia materials from two separate viewpoints.  The first form of evaluation should focus on insuring that the materials developed are usable by the targeted population.  Information uncovered from these early tests will then guide the authors in revising the user interface design of the presentation.  This type of evaluation is known as formative evaluation and is best conducted throughout the entire development cycle.  Effort in this direction shapes the final product to meet the immediate needs of the intended user audience.<p>	
Crismond and Wilson (1992) have developed an extensive evaluation tool at MIT to examine the effects on learning for the Engineering Design Instructional Computer System created at MIT.  The goal of this type of evaluation/assessment is totally learning centered.  Rather than focus on the media itself the examiner probes what kind of learning takes place.  This requires comparing the performance of various groups subjected to different treatments of the subject.  Here the goal is not to compare one media to another (i.e. text vs. multimedia) but instead to determine what the students are actually learning and how does this compare to the original objectives.  Such a test is typically based on analyzing the results from pre and post tests before and after the study period.  Results from such a study are again used to revise the instructional materials and optimize the entire system for maximum learning.<p>	
Throughout this phase of the project an effort will be made to include representatives from industry both as reviewers and learners.  It is important to understand all targeted audiences especially those at remote defense industry locations.<p> 

<A NAME="p4"><H4>Phase 4 - Dissemination and Adoption</H4></A><p>	
Initially, our primary objective is to develop multimedia materials which impact manufacturing education here at Georgia Tech.  This institution has already developed a strong philosophical commitment to technology enabled curriculum; however, little concrete deployment has yet to occur.  MIME will serve as the local leader in this area as it completes projects destined for the many academic disciplines involved in manufacturing.  Students will benefit from not only the specific materials created under this project but more importantly from an overall change in teaching.  As faculty involved in manufacturing adopt the concept of technology enabled curriculum they will be encouraged and supported to become departmental advocates.  MIME will work with these faculty to improve other manufacturing related courses eventually empowering the faculty themselves to develop much of their own TEC material in the future.  The impact will then extend far beyond those directly involved in this specific program.<p>	
Also, all course materials will eventually be packaged for transfer to other institutions and for use by defense industry personnel in remote locations.  To support this effort complete user and facilitator documentation will be developed to accompany the multimedia courseware.  The material will then be distributed through the educational efforts of various professional societies such as SME, ASME, and IEEE.  Other commercial distribution organizations such as Intellimation and EduCorp will also be given the opportunity to distribute the materials.  Wherever possible materials suitable for distribution electronically will be posted to the appropriate servers on Internet.  Finally, lessons learned in all phases of this project will be published widely and informal assistance offered to others wishing to do similar curriculum development.<p>	<p>

<A NAME="soe"><H4>Schedule of Events</H4></A><p>

<H2>Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS)
</H2><P>
An electronic performance support system (EPSS) is customized software that
integrates information, tools, and procedures to help users as they actually
perform a task.  A typical performance support system provides a combination
of the following capabilities:
<BR>
<UL><LI>Just-in-time, task-specific information such as step-by-step procedures
<LI>Reference information, such as machine specifications, for a job task
<LI>Expert advice about a job task
<LI>Automated tools to help the user perform tasks.
</UL><H2>Origami EPSS
</H2><P>
Our team created a simple multimedia EPSS to teach users how to fold a Japanese
paper jumping frog.  The media we used included text, drawings, audio narration,
and videos.  To free the user's hands while folding the paper, we provided
a voice recognition interface to the EPSS. 
<P>
We organized the information into sections that provided the step-by-step
procedure for folding the paper jumping frog, assistance with correcting
problems, and background information on origami.
<H2>Lessons Learned
</H2><P>We estimate that it took 150 labor hours to build our origami EPSS.
 We used
15 different software packages, 13 significant hardware items, and skills
that included computer programming, graphics design, hardware maintenance,
user interface design, and writing.  Along the way, we learned several lessons.
 They were: 
<BR>
<UL><LI>Use an interdisciplinary design team--Our team included educational
technologists, a graphic designer, training experts, and a user interface
designer
<LI>Plan for development to take a lot longer than you expected--We found
that it often took 10 times longer to accomplish a specific development step
than we expected
<LI>Iterate.  Iterate.  Iterate--We found that it was very worthwhile to
frequently perform a series of short develop-test-fix steps
<LI>Know when to stop--Limit yourself to making changes that obviously help
users perform their tasks.

<H2>Abstract
</H2><P>
An electronic performance support system (EPSS) uses technology to integrate
procedures, information, and tools to help users perform a task.  An EPSS
gives its users the information the users need to perform a task as they
actually perform the task.  This paper describes the process, hardware, and
software that our team used to create a simple origami EPSS.  This paper
also describes the rationale behind our design decisions and lists the lessons
that we learned from this experience.
<H2>Introduction
</H2><P>
This paper describes how our team developed a simple EPSS.  An EPSS integrates
procedures, information, and tools to help users as they perform a task (Gery,
1991).  A typical training system trains a person away from the job before
the person needs the training.  An EPSS gives people the information they
need when and where they need it -- on the job.
<P>
Our EPSS had two purposes:
<BR>
<OL><LI>To demonstrate to visitors and prospective customers a simple EPSS,
and
<LI>To give us experience using the technology needed to create multimedia
EPSSs.
</OL><P>
We wanted our demonstration EPSS to teach an unfamiliar, fun, slightly complex
task.  We decided to build a demonstration EPSS to help teach users how to
do origami, the ancient Japanese art of paper-folding.  The goal of our system
was to allow users to learn to fold a simple jumping frog.
<P>
After selecting the task that we wanted our EPSS to teach, we used paper
and pencil to sketch out the main menu and options that we wanted to include.
 The main menu included selections for learning which skill the system taught
("What do I do?"), the steps for performing the skill ("How do I do it?"),
support for de-bugging the user's performance ("Is this right?"), and a library
of background information on origami ("Origami library").  Paper and pencil
allowed us to show our ideas to other team members and to quickly, easily,
and cheaply make changes to the general design.
<P>
Our next step was to create a computer-based skeleton of our design.  Since
we (1) planned to use our system for educational (rather than presentation)
purposes, (2) wanted to include multimedia, and (3) wanted our system to
run on both Apple Macintosh and IBM-compatible personal computers, we selected
Macromedia Authorware for Macintosh as our authoring software.  Using Authorware
on an Apple Power Macintosh 8100/80AV, we laid out our main menu and some
of the more obvious sub-menus.  The main menu is shown in Figure 1.
<BR>

<P>
Since the heart of the EPSS was the steps
for folding the jumping frog, we began assembling the material that we wanted
to include in this section.  In our first attempt, we used Claris MacDraw
Pro and Aldus SuperPaint to begin drawing each of the steps in the jumping
frog paper-folding process.  We believed that by having complete control
over each drawing, we could simplify the drawings (origami uses unusual,
special instructional arrows) and add new drawings that might be helpful.
<P>
However, this technique proved to be painfully slow, and we soon decided
to simply scan in the drawings that we needed rather than re-create each
drawing ourselves.  We scanned the black and white drawings from our origami
book into an Apple Power Macintosh 7100/66AV using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet
IIc and Adobe Photoshop software.  After we scanned in the drawings, we rotated
each drawing to the proper angle, removed stray marks, improved the contrast,
and increased the image size.  We saved each image as a pict file and used
our network to import the images into our Authorware application.  We also
added controls to allow the user to move sequentially between drawings ("Next,"
"Previous"), to return to the main menu ("Main Menu"), and to exit the
application ("Quit").
<P>
It became clear, though, that we needed to supplement the drawings with verbal
instructions.  However, adding text to the display did not make sense because
the displayed text would not allow users to look at the drawing while reading
the verbal instructions.  So, we used Motion Works International SoundMate,
VideoFusion QuickFlix, and an Apple Macintosh microphone to record auditory
verbal instructions for making the fold shown in each drawing.  Then we used
Authorware to attach the auditory instructions to each drawing.  When the
user moved to each drawing in the jumping frog paper-folding process, the
audio instructions played automatically.  These media allowed the user to
look at the drawing while simultaneously hearing the verbal instructions.
 Figure 2 shows the drawing for making the fold for step 1.  The figure includes
the "Show Video" button that was added later.

<P>
We soon realized, however, that we were using static drawings to show a
motion-based procedure.  The static drawings allowed a user to dwell on a
drawing of a fold until the user understood it.  However, we thought that
there might be some learning advantages to providing to the user a video
of someone actually making the fold that the user had to make.  So, we used
QuickFlix and a VideoLabs FlexCam NTSC camera to record a three minute video
of one of us using office paper to fold the paper jumping frog.  We also
used QuickFlix to copy in the auditory instructions for each step of the
paper-folding process.  
<P>
Then we imported the file into Authorware and broke the file into 11 audio-video
segments that matched each of the 11 steps shown in the static drawings.
 Using Authorware, we connected the audio-video segments to the screen that
showed each drawing.  On each screen, we also added a "Show Video" button
to allow the user to see the video for that drawing.  So, the user could
(1) look at the static drawing for a fold while hearing the audio instructions,
and (2) look at a video showing the fold actually being made while hearing
the audio instructions.  To allow the user to stop the video, we also added
a "Clear Video" button to the screen whenever the user played a video.
<P>
However, we were not satisfied with our video.  We wanted to replace it with
a video showing someone folding brightly-colored, traditional origami paper
rather than plain white office paper.  Origami paper is differently colored
on the front and back of the paper, so we thought that it might be easier
to understand a fold that was shown using origami paper rather than a fold
that was shown using office paper.  We also wanted to insert pauses into
the video so that the user could hear part of the instructions for making
a fold before the video began showing the fold.  So, we used QuickFlix and
the VideoLabs camera to re-shoot the video using origami paper.  We imported
the file into Adobe Premiere because it has more advanced video editing features
than QuickFlix.  Then we inserted short (e.g., two second) pauses where needed
to allow the audio instructions for a fold to start before the video began
showing the fold.  Figure 3 shows an image from a video.
<BR>

<BR>
Figure 3.  Video for making a fold.
<P>
After reviewing the improved video, we realized that there were many long
periods of boring, slightly eerie silence between audio instructions.  To
be consistent with our origami theme, we decided to add to the video a background
audio track of traditional Japanese music.  We used Optical Media International's
Disc-to-Disk to transfer a song from a compact disk of traditional Japanese
music to our computer.  Then we imported the song into Premiere, set it up
to play simultaneously with our narrated audio track, adjusted its volume
so that it could be heard without drowning out the audio instructions, and
trimmed its length to match that of our video.  When we demonstrated our
work to our colleagues, most people thought the song was too slow and sleepy.
 This was not surprising since the song was a traditional Japanese lullaby.
 So, we repeated the procedure and replaced the song with a more upbeat tune.
<P>
Next we added a section to help users correct their performance.  On our
system main menu, we called this section "Is this right?" and added material
that helped users de-bug their folding frogs.  On the main menu for this
section, we displayed drawings from four different stages of the 11 step
jumping frog folding procedure.  We added textual instructions that asked
the user to first unfold the frog until it looked like one of the drawings,
then to click on the appropriate drawing.  
Figure 4 shows the "Is this right?" screen.  When the user clicked on a drawing,
we programmed Authorware to present the jumping frog tutorial at that step
in the paper-folding procedure.  This technique provided debugging support
to our users while re-using our previous work on the jumping frog tutorial.

<P>
To provide background reference material for the jumping frog paper-folding
task, we also developed an on-line origami library.  On our system main menu,
we called this section "Origami Library" and added textual information about
the history of origami, types of paper that are used, symbols for paper-folding
instructions, and ways to preserve origami creations.  
Figure 5 shows the "Origami Library" menu screen.
We supplemented the
textual information with illustrations from Corel Gallery and Microsoft
PowerPoint clip art.  We also added a background image from a World Wide
Web page on origami.  To change illustration colors and to add textual labels,
we imported the illustrations into Adobe Photoshop, made the changes, saved
the illustrations as pict files, and used our network to import the changed
illustrations into Authorware.  Figure 6 shows one of the Origami Library
History screens.

<P>
Our next development step was to port our completed EPSS from Authorware
for Macintosh to Authorware for Microsoft Windows.  This allowed us to run
our system on both Macintosh and IBM-compatible computers.  We ran into several
technical problems here.  For example, we had to change the Macintosh file
names to match the eight character prefix, three character suffix syntax
required by Windows.  We also had to put the sounds into QuickTime movie
files.
<P>
We thought it would be helpful if the user could operate the EPSS while folding
the paper.  That way, the user could match what the user saw on the video
with what the user was folding.  So, we used Verbex voice recognition software
to create a voice interface to our EPSS.  Since Verbex had trouble
differentiating some of our commands (for example, "What do I do?" and "How
do I do it?") we had to change some of our commands to phrases that were
more different (for example, "Give assignment" and "Provide steps"). 
<H2>Conclusions
</H2><P>
We estimate that it took 150 labor hours to build our demonstration multimedia
EPSS.  To develop the system, we needed to use a wide variety of skills that
included computer programming, graphics design, hardware maintenance, user
interface design, and writing.  We used 15 different software packages and
14 significant hardware items (see Table 1).  Along the way, we learned several
lessons.  They were: 
<BR>
<OL><LI>Use an interdisciplinary design team.  Our team included educational
technologists, a graphic designer, training experts, and a user interface
designer.  No one person had all the skills needed to build the high-quality,
easy-to-use EPSS that we wanted.  We usually assigned work to the person
who could do it best.  But we also found that each of us had to expand our
skills into new, unfamiliar areas.
<LI>Plan for development to take a lot longer than you expected.  We found
that it often took 10 times longer to accomplish a specific development step
than we expected.  Major time-consuming tasks included learning the
idiosyncrasies of various multimedia software packages, figuring out how
to correct authoring bugs, and recovering from occasional network crashes.
<LI>Iterate.  Iterate.  Iterate.  We found that it was very worthwhile to
frequently perform a series of short develop-test-fix steps.  This technique
allowed us to find errors when we were most familiar with what we had done
to create them, change design directions before we expended significant resources
on a design that did not work well, and keep our system working so that we
could continue development.  We also found that we got the most helpful feedback
when we asked non-team members to try our system.
<LI>Know when to stop, because you can always do more.  One of the benefits
of using multimedia is that it provides you with a tremendous amount of design
flexibility.  For example, you can present the same information using different
media or you can improve the quality of the media that you are already using.
 This flexibility is also one of the biggest challenges of multimedia
user-interface design.  We were constantly tempted to make our system even
better, but had to ruthlessly limit ourselves to changes that obviously helped
users perform their tasks.
</OL><P>
Our system showed customers and visitors what a multimedia EPSS was and how
it could help meet their human performance needs.  Users enjoyed the system
and seemed to think that we effectively utilized multimedia to improve learning.
 In addition, our team got valuable experience with the complex task of designing
and developing multimedia EPSSs.
<P>
We plan to perform objective and subjective evaluations of our demonstration
EPSSs.  The objective measurements may include the speed and accuracy with
which study participants learn to fold paper jumping frogs using the multimedia
EPSS versus the origami book.  The subjective measurements may include ratings
for how much the participants liked using the learning system, how effectively
they thought the learning system helped them to learn, and how likely they
would be to use the learning system in the future.  We will use the results
of this study to improve the proof-of-concept EPSS that we plan to build
for quality control inspectors in poultry plants.

<H2><CENTER>Introduction</CENTER></H2>
<P>
Ergonomics remains an important issue in industry today. Preventing and solving harmful ergonomic situations in the workplace can lead to greater productivity, profit, and employee moral. Currently, the School of Continuing Education at the Georgia Institute of Technology presents a week long course in ergonomics for industry personnel. This course covers basic ergonomic data, including anthropometric charts, data on human limitations, and the principles of workplace design; and how to conduct a survey of the workplace for harmful ergonomic activities. An important aspect of this course is learning to apply the basic ergonomic data while conducting a survey, that is, using the knowledge of human abilities and limitations to identify harmful ergonomic activities that are present while a worker is doing his or her job.
<P>
We have proposed, built, and evaluated a prototype interactive, multimedia instructional system, called ErgoTrainer. ErgoTrainer aids students, both students taking classes like the one taught at Georgia Tech and students learning on their own, in gaining basic ergonomic knowledge and learning the skill of job surveillance.
<P>
This paper discusses the ErgoTrainer prototype. The first section explains the reasons for using interactive multimedia. The next section provides a description of the ErgoTrainer prototype. The third section discusses the interactive portions of the ErgoTrainer prototype while the last section summarizes the results of the evaluation.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Why Interactive Multimedia?</CENTER>
</H2><P>Learning takes place when students are motivated and enjoy what they are learning. This is often the hallmark of multimedia systems (Hsi & Agogino, 1994). We believe that learning is an active, constructivist process and that students construct their own new knowledge by interacting with rich learning environments (Honebein, Duffy, & Fishman, 1993; Papert, 1991; Piaget, 1954).
<P>
The rich environment of the ErgoTrainer prototype was designed to simulate a real work environment. It is thought that authenticity, that is, a match between the learning environment and the environment in which the skill is to be used, promotes transfer of learned knowledge to the appropriate situation (Royer, 1979). To achieve this rich environment, multimedia appeared appropriate (Kozma, 1991). The subject, ergonomics, is best portrayed in a graphic, and sometimes dynamic, manner. Text, graphics, and videos have been combined to present a realistic ergonomic work environment.
<P>
Aiding constructivist learning requires that the instructional system be interactive. Little has been written about what constitutes an interactive system. However, Borsook and Higginbotham-Wheat (1991) have suggested seven dimensions of interactivity which they claim are the "key ingredients of interactivity." These dimensions shed light on the aspects required for a system to be considered interactive. After an introduction to the ErgoTrainer prototype, the prototype will be discussed in terms of the seven dimensions.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Description of ErgoTrainer</CENTER></H2>
<P>
ErgoTrainer is instructional courseware designed to teach industry personnel about the tools and processes used to complete an ergonomic job analysis. In ErgoTrainer, the student analyzes a real industry job, displayed in a video--in this case, a worker cutting chicken nuggets--by completing a checklist identical to one that actual ergonomists use when evaluating workplaces. This checklist is also one recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for identifying hazards in the workplace. The student is lead through the checklist one item at a time.
<P>
In the course of completing the checklist, the student selects and uses job analysis tools, represented by buttons, which are located on the screen at all times. Ergonomic job analysis often requires that specific tools be used to collect information about potentially hazardous activities a worker may engage in and potentially hazardous environments a worker might encounter. The tools provide the student with the information that would be gained if the tools were used in the real workplace. For example, when the thermometer button is clicked, the system reports that the temperature is 50 degrees. The job analysis tools in ErgoTrainer consist of: a ruler, a weight scale, a stopwatch, a goniometer (a tool for measuring body angles), a light meter, and a thermometer. ErgoTrainer's introduction identifies each tool for the student at the start of the program. In addition to the tools, the full checklist with an explanation of how to fill it out is displayed during the introduction.
<P>
A Help screen, which briefly describes the tools and their functionality, is available to the student at all times. In addition, a Hint button is available to the student as well, which yields information specific to the content of the current checklist item.
<P>
After the introduction, the student encounters the main job analysis screen (see Figure 1), which features a piece of digitized video in the center of the screen. Independent Start and Stop buttons allow the student to proceed through the video clip at their own pace. The student uses the tool buttons to gather information for a particular checklist item, then checks a single number on the checklist. In addition to the tools there is a Job Description button. When pressed, the job description button gives the student information about the job which cannot be obtained from the tool buttons or the video, like the number of hours the job is done and how the worker is paid.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<B>Figure 1 - ErgoTrainer Job Analysis Screen</B></CENTER><BR>
	
<P>
The Feedback Area, located immediately below the tool buttons, provides the student with the tool information and the job description, and rates the student's response as correct or incorrect.
<P>
When the entire checklist has been finished, a full, completed checklist is shown on the screen to the student (see Figure 2). The completed checklist indicates the correct response to each checklist item, as well as the sum total. The total indicates the level of ergonomic hazard. If the total is greater than 10, the student is advised that a detailed job analysis should be conducted to identify the specific motions or environmental conditions which are ergonomically hazardous.<BR><BR>

<H2><CENTER>Interactivity and ErgoTrainer</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The ErgoTrainer prototype embodies all seven of Borsook and Higginbotham-Wheat's interactivity dimensions to some degree. The seven dimensions are immediacy of response, non-sequential access of information, adaptability, feedback, options, bi-directional communication, and grain-size. The dimensions and their relationship to ErgoTrainer are discussed below.
<P>
<I>Immediacy of response.</I> This dimension refers to the length of time it takes the computer to respond to the user; the more immediate the response the better. ErgoTrainer attempts to respond immediately to all user actions. Reaction time is a function of the machine that ErgoTrainer is running on as opposed to limitations in ErgoTrainer.
<P>
<I>Non-sequential access of information.</I> A system with this dimension allows the user to access the information it contains in an unspecified order. ErgoTrainer embodies this dimension to the limit of not controlling the actions that the user takes within a checklist item. Within a checklist item information can be accessed in any order the student desires. However, the checklist items must be done in order.
<P>
<I>Adaptability.</I> This dimension implies that a computer system can adapt to the user in some manner.  ErgoTrainer does a limited amount of adapting.  ErgoTrainer only adapts in the sense that it allows non-sequential access to the information it contains.
<P>
<I>Feedback.</I> This dimension refers to the system's ability to provide information about the situation. Feedback says more than "right" or "wrong"; it is also provides information on how to correct the situation. In ErgoTrainer the feedback provides the student with information which allows the student to determine what to do next. For example, when the student selects an incorrect checklist item rating, the feedback not only lets the student know that he or she is incorrect but also tells the student what he or she needs to do to figure out the correct rating.
<P>
<I>Options.</I> Interactive programs provide options for the user to choose from. Allowing the student to page through sequential information is not providing options. The user should have more than one course of action to take. In ErgoTrainer, the student has the option of pressing any button he or she wants. If an inappropriate button is pressed, then the student is given feedback on why it was not an appropriate button at this time.
<P>
<I>Bi-directional communication.</I> Information should flow from the user to the computer as well as from the computer to the user. In ErgoTrainer, the student's actions provide the user to computer communication while feedback provides the computer to user communication. The actions imply when the student is asking for help or does not understand the material, then ErgoTrainer provides the appropriate feedback, thus effecting bi-directional communication.
<P>
<I>Grain-size.</I> "Grain-size refers to the length of time required of a given sequence before allowing further input. (Borsook & Higginbotham-Wheat, 1991, p. 13)." For example, a 10-minute video which the students cannot control is not the appropriate grain-size for interactive systems. The grain-size within a checklist item in ErgoTrainer is quite small. The student receives immediate feedback and the student can always interrupt ErgoTrainer. Overall, though, ErgoTrainer requires that the student to complete all the checklist items in order to finish ErgoTrainer.
<P>
Overall, ErgoTrainer scores quite high in these interactivity dimensions.  The interactivity is what we hope makes the task authentic and interesting to students.  The next section discusses the evaluation and the results.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>ErgoTrainer Evaluation and Results</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The evaluation of ErgoTrainer consisted of three phases. The first phase consisted of connoisseur-based studies (Flagg, 1990) with the goal of determining if the design of the content and interface of ErgoTrainer `made sense' to experts in the two areas. The second phase was a pilot test with one student with the goal of determining if a potential user could actually use ErgoTrainer without aid from the developers. The third phase was a structured evaluation with fifteen students currently enrolled in an ergonomics course. The goal of the third phase was to determine how well the intended students could use ErgoTrainer to learn about ergonomic job analysis. The students had completed almost four days of ergonomic instruction, including job analysis, when we ran our evaluation. The focus of this evaluation was usability and motivation. Learning effects were not measured because it would be difficult to determine the learning effect of ErgoTrainer as opposed to the learning effect of the class, and the time limit did not allow for individual interviews which might have teased out the learning effect of ErgoTrainer. During the third phase, students completed surveys to collect demographic and opinion data.
<P>
To summarize the demographic results, we determined that our audience contained fewer engineers than we expected and that all of the students used computers at work, with most of the students owning home computers. In addition, ten of the fifteen students have previously used some kind of computer-based instruction software and most of them enjoyed the experience.
<P>
The opinion questionnaire concentrated on ErgoTrainer's ease of use and ability to motivate. All of the students enjoyed using ErgoTrainer and all but one thought it was easy to use.  They especially liked the incorporation of video. Almost all the students commented on the video as soon as it appeared on the screen. About a third of the students were confused at some point in the program and suggested clearer prompts and better tool icons.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Conclusion</CENTER></H2>
<P>
On the whole, the ErgoTrainer prototype was a success. It provided the students with the ability to complete an ergonomic job analysis with many the benefits of being in a real situation, without the consequences of making errors in the real job. The students enjoyed using it and would like to see other ergonomic topics covered in a similar manner. The students became very involved in the system and tried not to make any mistakes. This serious attitude seems to support the theory that the environment is authentic and interesting.
<P>
Interactivity and multimedia provided for a learning experience that is similar to the real job the students will have to do. In some senses, ErgoTrainer is a simulation of an ergonomic job analysis, it has this feel because of the multimedia and interactivity.
<P>
Even though ErgoTrainer is interactive, it could be made even more interactive. This could be accomplished in two ways: 1) Allow access to the checklist items in any order and allow the students to backtrack to previous checklist items, and 2) Keep track of the students actions in order to provide more detailed and appropriate feedback. Multimedia and interactivity can be important ingredients in creating authentic tasks which increase the likelihood of transfer from the learning environment to the job, and the ErgoTrainer prototype is a step in the direction of interactive multimedia training.<BR>

Abstract: Factory Automation Support Technology (FAST) is a new project for
Georgia Tech researchers.  FAST uses special hardware and performance support
software to improve the performance of users on work tasks by giving users
the right information, in the right quantity, at the right time.  The special
hardware is a wearable, voice-activated computer that allows users to operate
the system while keeping their hands free to perform their tasks.  The
performance support software will provide helpful, relevant, just-in-time
information that users need to perform their tasks.  So, FAST will improve
the user's performance by providing helpful information when and where the
user needs it.  This paper provides some background information about the
FAST system, discusses issues to be addressed by this research, and describes
our planned development of proof-of-concept systems in the poultry industry.
<H2>Introduction
</H2><P>
Today's workplace is continuously changing.  There is increasing automation,
down-sizing or right-sizing, and more mobile work forces.  The increasing
levels of automation require that employees know how to maintain and keep
the automation running.  More sophisticated automation often requires that
the work force be better educated.  When organizations down-size or right-size,
machines are often used to replace human labor, but fewer employees are available
to deal with the more sophisticated equipment.  More work has to be done
by fewer people.  Since automation is often scattered throughout a factory,
if not throughout the world, maintainers must travel to the automation to
do their work.  These mobile workers cannot be supported by current static
technologies such as desktop personal computers.
<P>
To meet these challenges we need to rethink both technological support and
training. This new workplace environment often requires more training which
means that training needs to become more efficient.  There are several drawbacks
to the way training is currently done.  These drawbacks are summarized below.
<BR>
<UL><LI>Training is costly and time-consuming [Gery 1991].  Training takes
employees off the job and sometimes requires employees to travel to a different
location.  
<LI>Training is not immediate [Zemke and Zemke 1995, Gery 1991, Carr 1992].
 Training is often forgotten by the time it is finally needed on the job.
 Also, since a lot of training is not performed in the context of the job,
it is difficult for employees to transfer what they are learning in training
to the actual job that they do at work [Royer 1979].
<LI>Training is geared towards increasing knowledge as opposed to increasing
productivity [Carr 1992].  Since the true business goal of training is to
improve the productivity of the work force, training is currently not directly
serving this goal.
<LI>Training is trainer-centered as opposed to learner-centered [Connor 1983].
 The trainer decides what the employee should know as opposed to the employee
asking for the information that the employee needs to get the job done.
<LI>Training is evaluated on learner satisfaction and attainment of classroom
goals instead of job performance [Carr 1992].  Good job performance is the
true goal of training.
</UL><P>
Performance support systems have been promoted as a solution to these training
drawbacks [Gery 1991, Stevens and Stevens 1995] [see Table 1].  The goal
of performance support systems is to provide employees with the right
information, in the right quantity and detail, at the right time [Gery 1991].
 This includes just-in-time training in the tasks the employee needs to do.
 In other words, performance support systems allow less proficient employees
to perform as more experienced employees.  Industry is interested in performance
support systems because they not only improve employee performance but also
reduce the time normally used for training.  Performance support systems
train employees as they are performing their jobs, rather than before they
perform their jobs.  This is a major shift in the way training is currently
conducted.

The goal of the FAST project is to combine the latest technology in wearable
computers with an educational performance support system.  The following
sections describe the FAST hardware and software in turn.  Later sections
discuss our research goals and plans for implementation.
<H2>FAST Wearable Computer
</H2><P>
The FAST hardware consists of a wearable, voice-activated computer system.
 This computer system was assembled in our lab and is equivalent to a 486
25Mhz desktop computer. This computer system consists of several components
[see Figure 1].  These components are described below.
<BR>
<UL><LI>A see-through display allows the user to work while looking at text,
drawings, and video that are pertinent to the user's job.
<LI>A miniature microphone/earphone provides audio information to the user
and accepts voice input from the user which keeps the user's hands free for
job-related tasks.
<LI>A wireless communications link sends and receives up-to-date information
to and from the plant computer system.
<LI>A wearable computer allows the user to enter and receive information
wherever the user goes.
<LI>A battery pack to supply power for all the components (battery not shown
in Figure 1).
</UL><P>
This computer system enables employees to get information at the task site
and, since their hands are not busy operating the computer, to continue to
perform a task as they are receiving the information.  This wearable computer
system complements software-based performance support systems by making them
accessible to employees at all times and in all places during their work
day.  
<P>
We have spent some time looking at the ergonomic issues involved in a wearable
computer.  For example, where should the computer be worn to keep it out
of the way but have it accessible in case the buttons need to be used?  We
hope that the convenience, comfort, and helpfulness of FAST will encourage
employees to want to use the system.

<H2>FAST Educational Performance Support System
</H2><P>
The software component of the FAST system is an educational performance support
system.  Performance support systems usually consist of several types of
information. A typical performance support system provides a combination
of the following capabilities [Gery 1991, Reynolds and Araya 1995, Stevens
and Stevens 1995]:
<BR>
<UL><LI>Reference information about a job task or closely related set of
tasks
<LI>Just-in-time, task-specific training
<LI>Expert advice about a job task
<LI>Advice on how to use the performance support system effectively
<LI>Application help functions
<LI>Automated tools for task performance
</UL><P>
The three most common kinds of support information are:  reference information,
task-specific training, and expert advice.  Reference information describes
the task and other related tasks that the employee may need to perform. 
This reference information supports employees by making immediately available
information which they previously had to memorize or look for in a manual.
 For example, if a quality control inspector in a factory needs to check
that a machine reading is within tolerances, these tolerances can be supplied
by a performance support system.  As a result, the employee does not have
to remember the tolerances or to go back to her desk to compare the reading
to the specifications in a manual.  The reference section not only makes
employees more efficient but it also allows them to learn more deeply about
a given task.  The reference information is always available for the employee
to read and provides the theory behind the job tasks it supports.
<P>
Just-in-time, task-specific training reduces pre-job training by helping
employees to learn while doing their jobs.  For example, instead of looking
up information in a textbook that was used six months ago in a training class,
an employee can, for example, quickly access the on-line procedures for resetting
a piece of machinery that has gone out of tolerance limits.  This can be
done while the employee is standing in front of the piece of machinery.
 Just-in-time, task-specific training does not take the employee away from
the job, so it is not as time-consuming or expensive as traditional training.
 Since this type of training is done while employees are doing their jobs,
it is used immediately in the context of the job at hand.  Just-in-time,
task-specific training is also geared towards increasing productivity by
helping the employees do their jobs as opposed to teaching the employees
about their jobs.  Finally, this type of training is learner-centered because
employees ask for help when they need it to perform a task, and the help
gives them the specific information that they request.
<P>
Educational performance support systems often contain specific advice on
performing job tasks and using the performance support system to its greatest
advantage.  The advice is usually provided by an expert system.  Expert job
advice aids employees in reasoning about their tasks.  For example, an expert
job advisor may help an employee troubleshoot a piece of machinery to determine
why it is out of tolerance limits.  There can also be expert systems which
advise on the use of the performance support system as opposed to the actual
job task.  An expert performance support system advisor provides information
about the performance support system.  For instance, when the outcome of
a procedure does not match the expected one, the expert performance support
system advisor may suggest that the employee use the expert job advisor.
<P>
Two other types of information are application help functions and automated
tools for task performance.  These types of information are most helpful
when a supported task involves the use of a computer.  For example, application
help information can assist an employee with using an application necessary
to do his or her job  (e.g., a spreadsheet program).  Automated tools help
an employee perform a high-level task by doing lower-level tasks automatically.
 For example, an automated tool may aid a quality assurance employee by
calculating the average and total of quality data that is entered.
<H2>Additional Research Issue
</H2><P>
Besides the issues discussed above, an additional issue the FAST project
hopes to address is the question of how to support employees with computer
technology who do not normally work with computers to complete their tasks.
 Most performance support systems to date have been designed to aid workers
who currently have a computer in their work place and who use that computer
to perform their tasks (e.g., airline reservations agents, insurance providers).
 However, for tasks on which a computer is not currently used, there are
other issues to consider.  For example, what will be the effect of introducing
computers into the job?  Will computer literacy be a factor?  How do you
make the computer an integral part of the system?
<H2>Poultry Application
</H2><P>
We are currently implementing the FAST concept for two different poultry
industry applications.  The first application is a proof-of-concept performance
support system and wearable computer for quality control inspectors in poultry
processing plants.  The FAST hardware components will enable quality control
inspectors to directly input inspection data into a computer using voice
entry while their hands are busy manipulating poultry products.  The software
educational performance support system will tell an inspector how to do specific
inspections, how to compute measurement averages for the shift, what to do
if a measurement exceeds quality standards, and how to notify supervisors
if quality standards are not met.  The software performance support system
will also automatically integrate the quality information into daily reports.
 We are currently working closely with quality control personnel at a poultry
plant in Georgia to develop this proof-of-concept performance support system.
<P>
The second application is an initial educational performance support system
to aid plant personnel in conducting water reduction audits.  The system
will allow an employee to walk to various sites inside and outside the poultry
facility and perform specific tasks as defined by the performance support
system.  The performance support system will use text, audio, drawings, and
video to show the employee how to measure water flow, adjust water valves,
and calculate water usage.  We are working with environmental engineers at
Georgia Tech who currently perform this task at various sites across the
state of Georgia.
<H2>Summary
</H2><P>
By combining an educational performance support system and wearable computer
technology, Factory Automation Support Technology (FAST) addresses the learning
needs of workers while they perform their jobs. FAST addresses the drawbacks
of current training methods by providing learner-centered training when and
where it is needed.  FAST is not only addressing training issues but also
changes taking place in today's workplace.  These changes include increasing
automation, down-sizing, and more mobile work forces.  FAST has been implemented
as a demonstration system [<A HREF="edmedia1s.html">Najjar,
Ockerman, Thompson,
and Treanor (in press)]
</A>
and is currently being implemented in two poultry industry applications.

<H2>Training Challenges
</H2><P>
For training to be effective, it should be consistent with several challenging
guidelines.  These guidelines include:
<BR>
<UL><LI>Give training when the learner needs it
<LI>Give training where (physically) the learner needs it
<LI>Train the learner on only the information that the learner needs to do
their job
<LI>Allow the learner to control the training process
<LI>Use the medium (e.g., text, audio, drawings, video) that most effectively
communicates the information being learned
<LI>Emphasize performance rather than knowledge
<LI>Shorten the time between learning and application.
</UL><P>
Our project, Factory Automation Support Technology (FAST), meets these
challenging guidelines by combining two new technologies&aelig;a wearable
computer and an electronic performance support system.
<H2>Wearable Computer
</H2><P>
We are designing a customized wearable computer.  Figure 1 shows the computer's
major components.
<BR>
<BR>

Figure 1. Wearable computer components.
<P>
These are the features of the wearable computer:
<BR>
<UL><LI>See-through display allows user to work while looking at text, drawings,
and video
<LI>Miniature microphone and earphone provides audio information and accepts
voice input to keep the user's hands free for other tasks
<LI>Wireless communications link sends up-to-date information to plant computer
system
<LI>Wearable computer allows the user to enter and receive information wherever
the user goes
</UL><H2>Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS)
</H2><P>
The goal of performance support systems is to provide to employees the right
information, in the right quantity and detail, at the right time.  Performance
support systems allow less proficient employees to perform as more experienced
employees.  A typical performance support system provides a combination of
the following capabilities:
<BR>
<UL><LI>Reference information about a job task or closely related set of
tasks
<LI>Just-in-time, task-specific training
<LI>Expert advice about a job task
<LI>Advice on how to use the performance support system effectively
<LI>Application help functions
<LI>Automated tools for task performance
</UL><H2>Training Benefits
</H2><P> 
A wearable computer and an EPSS may improve the effectiveness of training
in certain situations.  In particular, these new technologies may be appropriate
when:
<BR>
<UL><LI>The user needs to learn how to perform specific tasks (as opposed
to facts or general concepts)
<LI>The user performs the tasks infrequently
<LI>The user must be mobile to perform the tasks
<LI>The user's hands must be available to perform the tasks
<LI>Multiple media (e.g., text, drawings, video, sound) are needed to communicate
the information to the user.
</UL><H2>Applications
</H2><P>
We used the FAST system to build one demonstration system and are working
on two industry applications.
<BR>
<UL><LI>Demonstration system shows how to make a jumping paper frog and provides
reference information about origami
<LI>One industrial application system trains environmental managers to perform
a water reduction audit
<LI>Second industrial application helps mobile Quality Assurance personnel
enter quality measurements while using their hands to take the measurements
</UL><H2>The Future
</H2><P>
We are already making plans to improve the wearable computer.  Our
second-generation computer will be faster, smaller, lighter, and use less
power than the current version.  We will also apply the lessons we learn
from building our EPSSs to making future systems even more effective.
<H2>Discussion Questions
</H2><P>
<UL><LI>How does this system change the way we design training?
<LI>How is training designed for this system different than other on-line
training systems?
<LI>What are some other applications of this technology?
<LI>What problems does this training technology present?
<LI>How can this training technology be made more effective?
<LI>In what environments will this training technology be helpful and in
what environments will it be a hindrance?

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Multimedia is being used increasingly to provide computer-based instruction. One reason for this trend may be the assumption that multimedia information helps people learn. To find out whether there is empirical support for this assumption, this paper reviews studies from a wide variety of fields to show that multimedia may be able to help people learn more information more quickly compared to traditional classroom lecture. Redundant multimedia does not always improve learning compared to "monomedia." Specific situations in which multimedia information may help people to learn include (a) when the media encourage dual coding of information, (b) when the media support one another, and (c) when the media are presented to learners with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned. There is empirical support for concluding that specific multimedia can be used to help people learn specific kinds of information.
<h2>Multimedia Information and Learning</h2>
<p>
Multimedia is the use of text, graphics, animation, pictures, video, and sound to present information. Since these media can now be integrated using a computer, there has been a virtual explosion of computer-based multimedia instructional applications. These applications run the gamut from serious computer-based tutorials for adults to the new category of "edutainment" products for children. These very diverse applications seem to share a common assumption--multimedia information helps people learn.
<p>
This assumption seems to be based more on personal opinion than on scientifically-based fact. People enjoy multimedia, prefer multimedia learning materials, and believe that multimedia helps them learn (e.g., Bosco, 1986; Bryant, Brown, Silberberg, & Elliot, 1980; Fletcher, 1989, 1990; Holliday, Brunner, & Donais, 1977; Rigney & Lutz, 1976; Samuels, Biesbrock, & Terry, 1974; Sewell & Moore, 1980). These beliefs are exploited by the marketers of multimedia hardware, software, and services to hype their products. One widely cited (e.g., "Eloquent Idea," 1992; Hofstetter, 1994; Staff, 1990) and completely unsupported assertion is that "People generally remember 10% of what they read, 20% of what they hear, 30% of what they see, [and] 50% of what they hear and see ..." (Treichler, 1967, p. 15).
<p>
So, people generally believe that multimedia helps them learn. But do empirical studies support this belief? This paper tries to cut through the hype and the enthusiasm to determine whether there is empirical support for the assumption that multimedia information presentation improves learning.
<h2>Classroom Lecture versus Multimedia Instruction</h2>
<p>
A good place to start is the classroom. The current, standard form of instruction is traditional classroom lecture. It seems reasonable to compare learning when the information is presented via classroom lecture to learning when the information is presented via computer-based multimedia.
<p>
Meta-analyses (Bosco, 1986; Fletcher, 1989, 1990; Khalili & Shashaani, 1994; Kulik, Bangert, & Williams, 1983; Kulik, Kulik, & Bangert-Drowns, 1985; Kulik, Kulik, & Cohen, 1980; Kulik, Kulik, & Schwalb, 1986; Schmidt, Weinstein, Niemic, & Walberg, 1985) examined over 200 studies that compared learning information that was presented in a traditional classroom lecture to learning the same information presented via
computer-based multimedia instruction. The students were in K-12, higher education, industry, and the military. The information that was learned included biology, chemistry, foreign languages, and electronic equipment operation. The control group usually
learned the information via classroom lecture or lecture combined with hands-on equipment experience. The comparison group usually learned the information via interactive videodisc
or some other kind of computer-based instruction. The researchers most often measured learning using tests of achievement or performance. Over this wide range of students and topics, the meta-analyses found that learning was higher when the information was presented via computer-based multimedia systems than traditional classroom lectures.
<p>
Another very significant finding was that learning appeared to take less time when multimedia instruction was used. For example, Kulik, Bangert, and Williams (1983) found one study that recorded an 88% savings in learning time with computerized instruction (90 minutes) versus classroom instruction (745 minutes) and another study that recorded a 39% savings in learning time (135 minutes for computerized instruction versus 220 minutes for classroom instruction). Both studies involved computer simulation instruction in physics. Kulik, Kulik, and Schwalb (1986) identified 13 studies in which students using computers mostly for tutoring learned in 71% less time than students in traditional classroom instruction. In a comparison involving eight studies, Kulik, Kulik, and Cohen (1980) found that computer-based instruction took about 2.25 hours per week while traditional classroom instruction took about 3.5 hours, a 36% savings in learning time. However, as impressive as these findings are, there may be other explanations for these results.
<h3>Instructional Method</h3>
<p>
For example, computer-based instruction may force the instructional designer to better organize and structure the learning material compared to traditional classroom lecture. This improved information organization may be responsible for the learning advantages associated with computer-based multimedia instruction.
<h3>Interactivity</h3>
<p>
Interactivity can be thought of as mutual action between the learner, the learning system, and the learning material (Fowler, 1980). Computer-based multimedia instruction tends to be more interactive than traditional classroom lectures.
<p>
Interactivity appears to have a strong positive effect on learning (Bosco, 1986; Fletcher, 1989, 1990; Verano, 1987). One researcher (Stafford, 1990) examined 96 learning studies and, using a statistical technique called effect size (difference between means of control and experimental group divided by standard deviation of the control group), concluded that interactivity was associated with learning achievement and retention of knowledge over time. Similar examinations of 75 learning studies (Bosco, 1986; Fletcher, 1989, 1990) found that people learn the material faster and have better attitudes toward learning the material when they learn in an interactive instructional environment.
<p>
So, the learning advantage of computer-based multimedia instruction over traditional classroom lecture may be due to the increased interactivity of multimedia instruction rather than the multimedia information itself.

<h3>Control of Learning Pace</h3>
<p>
Computer-based multimedia instruction allows the learner to personally set the pace of learning. Traditional classroom instruction does not. Self-paced learning is probably a more effective way to learn because the learner can move on to new material when the learner is ready. So, control of the learning pace is another possible explanation for the learning advantages associated with computer-based multimedia instruction.
<h3>Novelty</h3>
<p>
Information presented via multimedia may be more novel and stimulating than information presented via traditional classroom lecture. This explanation has some support from empirical studies. Analyses (Clark, 1983, 1985; Clark & Craig, 1992; Khalili & Shashaani, 1994; Kulik, Bangert, & Williams, 1983) of nearly 40 multimedia studies found that, compared to traditional classroom lecture, learning improvements were higher for groups that used multimedia for four weeks or less, but the learning advantage tailed off fairly strongly after eight weeks. The initial, higher learning advantages for multimedia may have been due to the novelty of the multimedia instruction. As students became more familiar with the multimedia, however, the novelty wore off, and the learning advantages decreased. It appears that the novelty of multimedia information has a slight, temporary, positive effect on learning.
<p>
So, computer-based multimedia information presentation appears to offer general learning advantages over the traditional classroom lecture presentation of information. Computer-based multimedia information seems to improve the level and rate of learning.  However, instructional method, interactivity, control of learning pace, and novelty are alternative explanations for these advantages.
<h2>Redundant Multimedia versus "Monomedia"</h2>
<p>
One way to try to eliminate the alternative explanations is to compare learning when the information, instructional method, interactivity, and pace are the same, and novelty is reduced. For example, this situation occurs when the same verbal information is presented using audio and printed text together (redundant multimedia) versus audio text alone ("monomedia"). Any performance differences found in these conditions are probably due to the media. 
<p>
Some studies (Levie & Lentz, 1982; Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992; Nugent, 1982; Pezdek, Lehrer, & Simon, 1984; Severin, 1967) looked at this kind of information presentation. These studies found that two redundant media seem to improve learning better than one medium. For example, Mayer and Anderson (1991) had college students (a) hear a verbal description simultaneously with an animation explaining how a bicycle pump works (redundant multimedia), (b) hear the verbal description only ("monomedia"), (c) see the animation only ("monomedia"), or (d) receive no training. On a problem-solving test, the students who heard a verbal description simultaneously with the animation (redundant multimedia) performed better than the other students. In another study (Nugent, 1982), the highest learning levels were obtained when elementary school students were presented information via combined text and pictures (redundant multimedia) or combined audio and pictures (redundant multimedia) compared to the same content presented via text alone ("monomedia"), audio alone ("monomedia"), or pictures alone ("monomedia").
<p>
However, redundant multimedia does not always lead to improved learning. For example, Severin (1967) found that children who learned animal names using two media (audio combined with print) did not show better animal name recognition than children who learned with one medium (print alone).
<p>
These inconsistent results may be due to the way in which the media are used. The next section identifies specific circumstances in which multimedia appears to improve learning. It seems that some situations more effectively improve multimedia learning than other situations.
<h2>Situations in which Multimedia Helps People Learn</h2>
<p>
There is empirical support for concluding that multimedia information provides learning advantages in several specific situations.
<h3>When the Media Support Dual Coding of Information</h3>
<p>
According to dual coding theory (Paivio, 1971, 1986, 1991; Clark & Paivio, 1991), information is processed through one of two generally independent channels. One channel processes verbal information such as text or audio. The other channel processes nonverbal images such as illustrations and sounds in the environment. Information can be processed through both channels. This occurs, for example, when a person sees a picture of a dog and also processes the word "dog." Information processed through both channels is called referential processing and has an additive effect on recall (Mayer & Anderson, 1991; Paivio, 1967, 1991; Paivio & Csapo, 1973). Learning is better when the information is referentially processed through two channels than when the information is processed through only one channel. Referential processing may produce this additive effect because the learner creates more cognitive paths that can be followed to retrieve the information.
<p>
Empirical multimedia studies support this idea. For example, in the Severin (1967) study mentioned earlier, animal name recognition accuracy was highest when children were presented the names via simultaneous audio and pictures (verbal and nonverbal channels). Children who received the same information via audio and print (two verbal channels) did not outperform students who received the information via print alone (verbal channel). Similarly, in the Nugent (1982) study, the highest learning levels were found when students were presented information via combined text and pictures (verbal and nonverbal channels) or combined audio and pictures (verbal and nonverbal channels) compared to the same content presented via text alone (verbal channel), audio alone (verbal channel), or pictures alone (nonverbal channel). 
<p>
In the Mayer and Anderson study (1991), the students who heard a verbal description simultaneously with the animation (verbal and nonverbal channels) performed better on a problem-solving test than the students who heard the description only (verbal channel), saw the animation only (nonverbal channel), or got no training. The same researchers (Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992) also performed a series of studies in which an auditory explanation of bicycle pump or automobile brake operation was presented before or during an explanation showing the same information. The mechanically-naive students who heard the explanation with the animation (combined verbal and nonverbal channels) performed better on a creative problem-solving test than the students who heard the verbal explanation before the animation (separate verbal and nonverbal channels).
<p>
However, there are cases in which presenting verbal and nonverbal media did not appear to lead to dual coding of the information, and, hence, improved learning. For example, in a classroom test, Samuels (1967) found that a related picture accompanying a simple short story interfered with the ability of poor first grade readers to learn to read the 50 words in the short story. In a laboratory study, Samuels (1967) presented words alone or words with identifying pictures to kindergarten children who were learning to read four words. After the children saw each word or word and picture, the experimenter read the word to the children. When the experimenter tested learning using only words, the children who saw only words performed better than the children who saw words with pictures. For this latter test, it appears that the pictures distracted the children. A review of related literature (Samuels, 1970) also concluded that pictures interfered with learning to read.
<p>
The studies described in this section support the idea that, except for learners who may be distracted by illustrations, learning may be improved when multimedia information encourages learners to referentially process the information in a dual coding fashion.
<h3>When the Media Support One Another</h3>
<p>
Multimedia information seems to improve learning when the media show closely related, supportive information. For example, Bransford and Johnson (1972) presented short, ambiguous text passages to high school students. Before seeing each passage, one group of students saw a picture that explained the ambiguous text. The researchers believed that this picture provided a context for understanding the ambiguous text. The students who saw the picture recalled more ideas from the text than the students who did not see the picture. It appears that the picture helped the students to interpret the meaning of the text.
<p>
In a review of the literature on text and illustrations, Levie and Lentz (1982) found that text that was accompanied by illustrations showing what was described in the text was learned better by children than text that was not accompanied by illustrations. For example, Peeck (1974) asked fourth grade children to read a story with supportive illustrations or without illustrations, measured learning via multiple choice, verbal recognition tests, and found that retention was better when the text was accompanied by supportive illustrations. Levie and Lentz estimated that children reading illustrated text learned one-third more than children reading non-illustrated text, especially when the illustrations supported information presented in the text. These results are consistent with the dual coding theory described above. Supportive illustrations may also make abstract relationships more concrete and simplify the complex (Winn, 1987, 1989).
<p>
Levie and Lentz (1982) also found that illustrations that did not show what was described in the text did not improve learning. For example, Sewell and Moore (1980) added to textual material small cartoons that did not support the textual information. Although the students enjoyed the cartoons, the cartoons did not affect learning. Evans and Denney (1978) found that the short phrases in picture-phrase combinations were recalled better as the pictures and phrases became more related. Using verbal captions, Bahrick and Gharrity (1976) showed that pictures helped people recall captions that were related to the pictures, but not captions that were unrelated.
<p>
Also, as Samuels' (1967) work with poor first grade readers suggested earlier, there appear to be some cases in which the addition of the nonverbal medium actually decreases learning. Poor first grade readers appeared to be distracted by the supporting illustrations that were added to the text. 
<p>
These results suggest that the mere presence of illustrations does not improve the learning of textual information. The illustrations must show information that is presented in the text and the learners must be able to avoid getting distracted by the nonverbal media. It appears that supportive illustrations help explain the textual material and allow learners to build connections between the verbal (text) and nonverbal (illustrations) information (Paivio, 1971, 1991; Clark & Paivio, 1991). This referentially processed, dual coded information leads to improved learning.
<h3>When Media are Presented to Learners with Low Prior Knowledge or Aptitude in the Domain Being Learned</h3>
<p>
Multimedia information appears to be more effective for learners with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned. Mayer (1993) believes that this is because the multimedia helps low domain knowledge learners to connect the new knowledge to prior knowledge or, for learning systems such as a bicycle pump, to build a cognitive model of the system. Multimedia may also make more important information more obvious. However, learners with high domain knowledge have a rich source of prior knowledge that can be connected to the new knowledge. These learners can make these connections or build cognitive models with text alone. Also, learners with high domain knowledge are more likely to know which information is important and on which information they should focus their attention.
<p>
In one study (Mayer & Gallini, 1990), college students read text with and without illustrations that explained the operation of automobile drum brakes. For college students with low prior knowledge of automobile drum brake operation, the illustrations improved their recall of explanative information and their ability to solve problems related to the explanations. For college students with high prior knowledge, the explanative illustrations did not affect their performance. Another study (Kunz, Drewniak, & Schott, 1989) found that for college students with low prior meteorology knowledge, use of pictures in text correlated positively with comprehension. But, for college students with high prior meteorology knowledge, use of pictures in text did not correlate with comprehension.
<p>
Studies by Blake (1977) and Wardle (1977, cited in Levie & Lentz, 1982) found that aptitude affected learning from multimedia. In the Blake (1977) study, college students with low or high aptitude in spatial and mental abilities learned the pattern of movement of five chess pieces via moving pictures (film), static pictures, or static pictures with arrows indicating motion. The students with low aptitude performed better in the conditions with moving pictures or static pictures with motion arrows than the condition with static pictures alone. However, the students with high aptitude performed similarly on all three kinds of pictures.
<p>
Wardle (1977, cited in Levie & Lentz, 1982) gave 800-word textual passages on various science topics to seventh grade students. Some of the passages included supporting illustrations. During a comprehension test, the students were allowed to look at the materials. Poor readers performed better when the passages included illustrations. For good readers, the illustrations had no effect.
<p>
The results of these studies suggest that multimedia is most effective for people with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned. This may be because experts already have a cognitive model and large amounts of information for new knowledge to connect to, but novices do not. Alternatively, novices may not know which information is important and on which information they should focus their attention.
<p>
So, empirical studies support the idea that multimedia may help people learn. Multimedia that encourages the information to be processed referentially, building dual coded verbal and pictorial cognitive representations, seems to improve learning. For example, relevant, supportive illustrations improved the learning of textual stories.  Multimedia also seems to be more effective for helping learners with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned.
<h2>Allocating Media for Presenting Information</h2>
<p>
Multimedia may also improve learning by allowing instructional designers to use the most effective medium to present specific information. Although media selection models based on learning objectives (e.g., Allen, 1974), data-to-medium rules (e.g., Arens, 1992; Arens, Miller, Shapiro, & Sondheimer, 1988), communication goals (e.g., Elhadad, Seligmann, Feiner, & McKeown, 1989; Feiner & McKeown, 1990, 1991a, 1991b) or learner characteristics, tasks, and instructional settings (e.g., Reiser & Gagne&acute;, 1982) are available, these models appear to be based on experienced judgment rather than on empirical studies. To improve the ability of instructional designers to make effective media allocation decisions, the following section summarizes the limited number of empirical studies that suggest how to allocate specific media for successfully presenting specific kinds of information to be learned. The results are shown in Table 1.

<h3>Assembly Instructions</h3>
<p>
To learn assembly instructions, it appears that text and pictures work well. Bieger and Glock (1986) found that people assembled with fewer errors when they received spatial information via text, but they performed the assembly task more quickly when they received spatial information via pictures. In another study (Stone & Glock, 1981), college students who used text with pictures made fewer errors on an assembly task than college students who used text alone. Apparently the best way to learn an assembly task is to acquire both spatial and verbal knowledge about the task steps. 
<p>
<h3>Procedural Information</h3>
<p>
To present procedures for operating a device, it appears that using a diagram and explanatory text helps people acquire a cognitive model of how the device works. Studies (e.g., Kieras, 1984; Kieras & Bovair, 1983, 1984) found that this device model allows people to infer procedures more quickly than people who learn about the device by using repetition without full comprehension.  Motion sometimes helps people learn procedures better than still pictures (e.g., Spangenberg, 1973).
<p>
Another study (Palmiter & Elkerton, 1991) found that text was better than animation for presenting procedural information. On an immediate test, people who saw animated demonstrations learned HyperCard authoring procedures faster and more accurately than people who saw only text. However, seven days later the people who saw only text were faster and as accurate as the people who saw animated demonstrations. Perhaps the textual procedures were learned better than the animated demonstrations due to differences in processing effort (e.g., Jacoby, Craik, & Begg, 1979; Salomon, 1984; Walker, Jones, & Mar, 1983). The text learners may have expended more effort to read and understand the information, resulting in improved long-term encoding of the information. But the people who watched the animated demonstrations may have passively observed the demonstrations without processing the information as well. The immediate test did not emphasize these differences in long-term encoding. However, the delayed test did. The results of the delayed test suggest that the animated procedures faded from memory much more than the textual procedures.
<h3>Problem-Solving Information</h3>
<p>
To learn problem-solving information, an animation with verbal narration was shown to be effective (Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992). People who saw an animation with verbal narration did better on a bicycle pump problem-solving test than people who got no training, saw the animation only, or heard the verbal description only.
<p>
To perform mathematical problem-solving, graphical presentations of information can improve performance compared to textual presentations (Moyer, Sowder, Threadgill-Sowder, & Moyer, 1984; Reed, 1985; Threadgill-Sowder & Sowder, 1982; Threadgill-Sowder, Sowder, Moyer, & Moyer, 1985). For example, one study (Threadgill-Sowder, Sowder, Moyer, & Moyer, 1985) found that grade school students who scored in the lowest quartile on a cognitive restructuring test (Hidden Figures Test) were able to improve their scores when the story problems in the test were presented using drawings that organized the problem data. Another study (Moyer, Sowder, Threadgill-Sowder, & Moyer, 1984) found that children in grades three to 11 solved mathematical word problems better with text and illustrations of the problem elements than text alone. The illustrations were more helpful to the low-ability readers than the readers with more ability. It appears the illustrations helped make the word problems more concrete, easier to understand, and, therefore, easier to solve.
<h3>Recognition Information</h3>
<p>
To communicate information that people need to recognize, pictures are extremely effective. In one study (Shepard, 1967), people looked at 600 pictures, sentences, or words. On an immediate test, recognition accuracy was 98% for pictures, 90% for sentences, and 88% for words. Another study (Nickerson, 1968) found that people had 63% recognition accuracy for a group of 200 black and white photographs one year after initial viewing. Other researchers (Standing, Conezio, & Haber, 1970) showed people 2,560 photographs for 10 seconds each. After three days, the study participants recorded recognition accuracy of over 90%. Read and Barnsley (1977) showed adults pictures and text from the elementary school books they used 20 to 30 years ago. Recognition accuracy rates for pictures and text were better than chance, with pictures alone being recognized more accurately than text alone. Finally, Stoneman & Brody (1983) found that children in visual or audiovisual conditions recognized more products in commercials than children in an auditory only condition. Pictures seem to allow very rich cognitive encoding that allows surprisingly high recognition rates, even years after the initial encoding took place.
<h3>Spatial Information</h3>
<p>
Illustrations are superior to text when learning spatial information. For example, Bartram (1980) arranged for college students to learn how to get from a starting point to a destination using a minimum number of buses. The researcher presented the bus route information via maps or lists and asked the students to provide as quickly as possible the correct list of bus numbers in the correct order. Bartram measured the time it took to correctly complete each bus route task. The study found that the students learned the bus route information more quickly when they used a map than when they used lists. Bartram believed that the students performed a spatial task, and the maps were superior to lists because the map presentation of information is consistent with people's preferred internal representation of spatial information.
<p>
In an exploratory study, Bell and Johnson (1992) allowed four people to select pictures or text for communicating instructions for loading a battery into a camera. Qualitative results showed a strong preference for pictures rather than text. The researchers believed that the information to be communicated was spatial, and that the results supported the hypothesis that spatial information should be presented pictorially.
<p>
A study by Garrison (1978) supported the idea that spatial relations are recalled and recognized better by children when the spatial relations are presented via story text and illustrations rather than story text alone. Also, a series of studies by Dwyer (1967, 1978) found that illustrated text was better than text alone when students were tested on spatial information using a drawing test.
<p>
Pictures appear to be an effective way to learn spatial information. This may be because spatial information tends to be encoded spatially (e.g., Kosslyn, 1973, 1975, 1976; Kosslyn, Ball, & Reiser, 1978) rather than verbally or by what it means (i.e., semantically). 
<h3>Small Amounts of Verbal Information</h3>
<p>
Sound appears to be an effective way to communicate a small amount of verbal information for a short period of time. For example, Murdock (1968) found that recognition for items in a nine item verbal list was better with an auditory presentation than with a visual presentation. Another study (Watkins & Watkins, 1980) found better short-term memory for a few verbal items when the items were presented via the auditory mode rather than the visual mode. A review of the related literature (Penney, 1975) concluded that, for tasks involving short-term memory, auditory presentation was better than visual presentation. This conclusion appears to be appropriate for about six verbal items. These results are consistent with Baddeley's (1983, 1988) concept of an articulatory loop for retaining verbal information in working memory and Conrad's (1964) finding that verbal information was coded via sound in short-term memory.
<h3>Story Details</h3>
<p>
For recalling story details, video with a soundtrack appears to be effective. Baggett (1979) found that, after a seven-day delay, college students who saw a dialogueless movie made fewer errors when recalling the story structure than college students who heard only equivalent text. On an immediate test of factual recall, children who saw a movie with an audio narration did better than children who heard a similar narration via radio (Barrow & Westley, 1959). Children recalled more story details when the story was presented via television with a narrated soundtrack than radio (soundtrack alone) (Beagles-Roos & Gat, 1983). Another study (Meringoff, 1980) found that children remembered more story actions when they saw a televised film with story narration than when they were read a very similar illustrated story. 
<p>
Static pictures also appear to help children learn auditory, oral prose. Levin and Lesgold (1978) reviewed a dozen studies that examined the effect of pictures on children's ability to learn auditory, oral, fictional, stories. The pictures reflected the contents of the stories and learning was measured by short answers to factual questions. The reviewers found that related pictures improved learning of the oral prose.
<p>
It appears that both dynamic and static pictures help people learn story details and prose. This may be due to the ability of pictures to serve as a rich cognitive node to which verbal information can be connected and subsequently retrieved.
<p>
There is empirical support for concluding that certain media combinations seem to be better than others for helping people to learn specific kinds of information. These combinations may encourage the information to be processed in a way that is easier to encode, store, retrieve, and use. 
<p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This examination of a wide variety of empirical studies shows that multimedia information helps people learn--sometimes. Computer-based multimedia instruction may help people to learn more information in less time than traditional classroom lectures. This is especially the case when the computer-based multimedia instruction is interactive and learner-paced. The learning advantage for redundant multimedia over "monomedia" is not consistent. But this inconsistency is resolved when one takes into consideration the specific circumstances in which the media are presented. In particular, there is empirical support for concluding that multimedia information is most effective when:
<ol>
<li>It encourages the dual coding of information.
<li>The media clearly support one another.
<li>The media are presented to learners with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned.
</ol>
<p>
There is some empirical support for using specific multimedia to help people learn specific kinds of information. These advantages appear to be due to the ability of certain multimedia combinations to support the way people understand, organize, and access the information.
<h3>Unanswered Questions</h3>
<p>
Although this paper identified when and why multimedia seems to help people learn in several situations, some unanswered questions still remain. For example, is there an overall theory that we can apply to explain these empirical results and to predict future results? Since the media may affect how the learning material is encoded and retrieved, information encoding and retrieval theories (e.g., Anderson, 1976, 1983a, 1983b, 1993; Anderson & Reder, 1979; Mayer, Steinhoff, Bower, & Mars, 1995; Paivio, 1971, 1986, 1991; Reder, 1980) are possibilities. The effects of dual (verbal and pictorial) coding and elaboration are particularly promising (e.g., Najjar, 1995, 1996).
<p>
In many learning situations, we present information using multimedia, but test learning using pencil and paper. If we use a different technique to present information, should we use a different technique to test learning? Multimedia learning may be artificially low because the media we use in our tests do not match the media we use in our information presentation.
<p>
Also, there is informal support for concluding that using multimedia to support learning by building (e.g., Papert, 1991), collaborative learning (e.g., Scardamalia, Bereiter, McLean, Swallow, & Woodruff, 1989), and case-based teaching (e.g., Schank, 1991) help people to learn. Can we get strong, formal, empirical support for these promising multimedia-based learning techniques?
<p>
When used properly, multimedia can help people to learn.

<H2><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></H2>
<P>
An interactive, multimedia instructional system prototype, called ErgoTrainer, has been proposed, built, and evaluated. ErgoTrainer is based on the constructivist perspective of instruction. It aids students in gaining ergonomic knowledge and learning the skill of ergonomic job analysis while performing a simulated job analysis on a real industry job. Through the use of case-studies and hands-on experience, a learning environment is constructed which promotes both exploratory constructivist based learning as well as guided exploration. The use of multimedia promotes authenticity and hopefully leads to transfer of the learned knowledge to the workplace. The results of initial evaluation of the prototype are positive.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Introduction</CENTER></H2>
<P>
Ergonomics remains an important issue in industry today. Preventing and solving harmful ergonomic situations in the workplace can lead to greater productivity, profit, and employee moral. Currently, the School of Continuing Education at the Georgia Institute of Technology presents a week long course in ergonomics for industry personnel. This course covers basic ergonomic data, including anthropometric charts, data on human limitations, and the principles of workplace design; and how to conduct a survey of the workplace for harmful ergonomic activities. An important aspect of this course is learning to apply the basic ergonomic data while conducting a survey, that is, using the knowledge of human abilities and limitations to identify harmful ergonomic activities that are present while a worker is doing his or her job.
<P>
This paper discusses the ErgoTrainer prototype. The first section discusses learning issues. The second section explains the reasons for using interactive multimedia. The next section provides a description of the ErgoTrainer prototype. The fourth section discusses the interactive portions of the ErgoTrainer prototype while the last section summarizes the results of the evaluation.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Learning Issues</CENTER></H2>
<P>
Several different concepts influenced the design of ErgoTrainer.  These concepts are drawn from our beliefs as to how students learn best.  We believe that learning is a constructivist process [1,2,3]. That is, the student must construct their own understanding of new knowledge.  We also believe that this construction happens best in a rich environment which supports learning-by-doing, in which students fail safely but ultimately succeed, and in which their process is supported.
<P>
In order to create this learning environment, we based the design of ErgoTrainer on Schank, Fano, and Jona's goal-based scenario (GBS)[4].  Schank et al. describe GBSs as "problems in the domain of the student's interest that present him with definable goals and encourage learning in service of achieving those goals." In ErgoTrainer, the goal is to perform an ergonomic job analysis and the students need to understand basic ergonomics knowledge to accomplish this goal. This provides an opportunity to tie basic ergonomic knowledge to the task for which it is useful. A goal-based scenario is structured around teaching students a skill.  Other learning (i.e., facts) takes place while the student pursues the goal of accomplishing the taught skill.  It is thought that information is more readily learned and remembered if the reason for learning the information is made explicit in a relevant task [5,4].  By connecting the presentation of the basic ergonomic information to the task of completing a job analysis, ErgoTrainer makes the importance of the basic ergonomic information obvious.
<P>
To provide the student with freedom to learn as he or she wants, ErgoTrainer has been developed to allow the student to fail.  That is, the student can perform the skill incorrectly.  At that point the student is notified that he or she has answered incorrectly and is allowed to try again with a hint pointing in the correct direction. Eventually, the student will be able to look up the necessary information in an attached reference section.  Hints, given when the student answers incorrectly or when the student asks for a hint, are provided as a form of scaffolding [6,7].  Scaffolding provides students with support which allows them to accomplish a task they would not be able to accomplish without support.  However, as the student becomes more proficient, scaffolding fades.  ErgoTrainer's scaffolding fades by allowing the students to choose the amount of scaffolding of which they take advantage.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Why Interactive Multimedia?</CENTER></H2>
<P>
Learning takes place when students are motivated and enjoy what they are learning. This is often the hallmark of multimedia systems [8].
<P>
The rich environment of the ErgoTrainer prototype was designed with multimedia to simulate a real work environment. It is thought that authenticity, that is, a match between the learning environment and the environment in which the skill is to be used, promotes transfer of learned knowledge to the appropriate situation [9]. To achieve this rich environment, multimedia appeared appropriate [10]. The subject, ergonomics, is best portrayed in a graphic, and sometimes dynamic, manner. Text, graphics, and videos have been combined to present a realistic ergonomic work environment.
<P>
Aiding constructivist learning requires that the instructional system be interactive. Little has been written about what constitutes an interactive system. However, Borsook and Higginbotham-Wheat [11] have suggested seven dimensions of interactivity which they claim are the "key ingredients of interactivity." These dimensions shed light on the aspects required for a system to be considered interactive. After an introduction to the ErgoTrainer prototype, the prototype will be discussed in terms of the seven dimensions.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Description of ErgoTrainer</CENTER></H2>
<P>
ErgoTrainer is instructional courseware designed to teach industry personnel about the tools and processes used to complete an ergonomic job analysis. In ErgoTrainer, the student analyzes a real industry job, displayed in a video--in this case, a worker cutting chicken nuggets--by completing a checklist identical to one that actual ergonomists use when evaluating workplaces. This checklist is also one recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for identifying hazards in the workplace. The student is lead through the checklist one item at a time.
<P>
In the course of completing the checklist, the student selects and uses job analysis tools, represented by buttons, which are located on the screen at all times. Ergonomic job analysis often requires that specific tools be used to collect information about potentially hazardous activities a worker may engage in and potentially hazardous environments a worker might encounter. The tools provide the student with the information that would be gained if the tools were used in the real workplace. For example, when the thermometer button is clicked, the system reports that the temperature is 50 degrees. The job analysis tools in ErgoTrainer consist of: a ruler, a weight scale, a stopwatch, a goniometer (a tool for measuring body angles), a light meter, and a thermometer. ErgoTrainer's introduction identifies each tool for the student at the start of the program. In addition to the tools, the full checklist with an explanation of how to fill it out is displayed during the introduction.
<P>
A Help screen, which briefly describes the tools and their functionality, is available to the student at all times. In addition, a Hint button is available to the student as well, which yields information specific to the content of the current checklist item.
<P>
After the introduction, the student encounters the main job analysis screen (see Figure 1), which features a piece of digitized video in the center of the screen. Independent Start and Stop buttons allow the student to proceed through the video clip at their own pace. The student uses the tool buttons to gather information for a particular checklist item, then checks a single number on the checklist. In addition to the tools there is a Job Description button. When pressed, the job description button gives the student information about the job which cannot be obtained from the tool buttons or the video, like the number of hours the job is done and how the worker is paid.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<B>Figure 1 - ErgoTrainer Job Analysis Screen</B></CENTER><BR> 

The Feedback Area, located immediately below the tool buttons, provides the student with the tool information and the job description, and rates the student's response as correct or incorrect.

When the entire checklist has been finished, a full, completed checklist is shown on the screen to the student (see Figure 2). The completed checklist indicates the correct response to each checklist item, as well as the sum total. The total indicates the level of ergonomic hazard. If the total is greater than 10, the student is advised that a detailed job analysis should be conducted to identify the specific motions or environmental conditions which are ergonomically hazardous.

<H2><CENTER>Interactivity and ErgoTrainer</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The ErgoTrainer prototype embodies all seven of Borsook and Higginbotham-Wheat's interactivity dimensions to some degree. The seven dimensions are immediacy of response, non-sequential access of information, adaptability, feedback, options, bi-directional communication, and grain-size. The dimensions and their relationship to ErgoTrainer are discussed below.
<P>
<I>Immediacy of response</I>. This dimension refers to the length of time it takes the computer to respond to the user; the more immediate the response the better. ErgoTrainer attempts to respond immediately to all user actions. Reaction time is a function of the machine that ErgoTrainer is running on as opposed to limitations in ErgoTrainer.
<P>
<I>Non-sequential access of information</I>. A system with this dimension allows the user to access the information it contains in an unspecified order. ErgoTrainer embodies this dimension to the limit of not controlling the actions that the user takes within a checklist item. Within a checklist item information can be accessed in any order the student desires. However, the checklist items must be done in order.
<P>
<I>Adaptability</I>. This dimension implies that a computer system can adapt to the user in some manner.  ErgoTrainer does a limited amount of adapting.  ErgoTrainer only adapts in the sense that it allows non-sequential access to the information it contains.
<P>
<I>Feedback</I>. This dimension refers to the system's ability to provide information about the situation. Feedback says more than "right" or "wrong"; it is also provides information on how to correct the situation. In ErgoTrainer the feedback provides the student with information which allows the student to determine what to do next. For example, when the student selects an incorrect checklist item rating, the feedback not only lets the student know that he or she is incorrect but also tells the student what he or she needs to do to figure out the correct rating.
<P>
<I>Options</I>. Interactive programs provide options for the user to choose from. Allowing the student to page through sequential information is not providing options. The user should have more than one course of action to take. In ErgoTrainer, the student has the option of pressing any button he or she wants. If an inappropriate button is pressed, then the student is given feedback on why it was not an appropriate button at this time.
<P>
<I>Bi-directional communication</I>. Information should flow from the user to the computer as well as from the computer to the user. In ErgoTrainer, the student's actions provide the user to computer communication while feedback provides the computer to user communication. The actions imply when the student is asking for help or does not understand the material, then ErgoTrainer provides the appropriate feedback, thus effecting bi-directional communication.
<P>
<I>Grain-size</I>. "Grain-size refers to the length of time re-quired of a given sequence before allowing further input. [11, p.13]." For example, a 10-minute video which the students cannot control is not the appropriate grain-size for interactive systems. The grain-size within a checklist item in ErgoTrainer is quite small. The student receives immediate feedback and the student can always interrupt ErgoTrainer. Overall, though, ErgoTrainer requires that the student to complete all the checklist items in order to finish ErgoTrainer.
<P>
Overall, ErgoTrainer scores quite high in these interactivity dimensions.  The interactivity is what we hope makes the task authentic and interesting to students.  The next section discusses the evaluation and the results.

<H2><CENTER>Evaluation and Results</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The evaluation of ErgoTrainer consisted of three phases. The first phase consisted of connoisseur-based studies [12] with the goal of determining if the design of the content and interface of ErgoTrainer `made sense' to experts in the two areas. The second phase was a pilot test with one student with the goal of determining if a potential user could actually use ErgoTrainer without aid from the developers. The third phase was a structured evaluation with fifteen students currently enrolled in an ergonomics course. The goal of the third phase was to determine how well the intended students could use ErgoTrainer to learn about ergonomic job analysis. The students had completed almost four days of ergonomic instruction, including job analysis, when we ran our evaluation. The focus of this evaluation was usability and motivation. Learning effects were not measured because it would be difficult to determine the learning effect of ErgoTrainer as opposed to the learning effect of the class, and the time limit did not allow for individual interviews which might have teased out the learning effect of ErgoTrainer. During the third phase, students completed surveys to collect demographic and opinion data.
<P>
To summarize the demographic results, we determined that our audience contained fewer engineers than we expected and that all of the students used computers at work, with most of the students owning home computers. In addition, ten of the fifteen students have previously used some kind of computer-based instruction software and most of them enjoyed the experience.
<P>
The opinion questionnaire concentrated on ErgoTrainer's ease of use and ability to motivate. All of the students enjoyed using ErgoTrainer and all but one thought it was easy to use.  They especially liked the incorporation of video. Almost all the students commented on the video as soon as it appeared on the screen. About a third of the students were confused at some point in the program and suggested clearer prompts and better tool icons.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Conclusion</Center></H2>
<P>
On the whole, the ErgoTrainer prototype was a success. It provided the students with the ability to complete an ergonomic job analysis with many of the benefits of being in a real situation, without the consequences of making errors in the real job. The students enjoyed using it and would like to see other ergonomic topics covered in a similar manner. The students became very involved in the system and tried not to make any mistakes. This serious attitude seems to support the theory that the environment is authentic and interesting.
<P>
Even though we did not evaluate learning issues, we believe that the system can be improved by the use of more cases (i.e., different job videos) and by slowly providing the student with less support in using the tools. Currently, the students are told which tools will provide them with helpful information for each checklist item.  Future efforts will let the students determine this for themselves. ErgoTrainer requires some revisions and evaluation of the learning principles, but it proved to be a promising start.
<P>
Interactivity and multimedia provided for a learning experience that is similar to the real job the students will have to do. In some senses, ErgoTrainer is a simulation of an ergonomic job analysis, it has this feel because of the multimedia and interactivity.
<P>
ErgoTrainer is interactive, but it could be made even more interactive. This could be accomplished in two ways: 1) Allow access to the checklist items in any order and allow the students to backtrack to previous checklist items, and 2) Keep track of the students actions in order to provide more detailed and appropriate feedback. Multimedia and interactivity can be important ingredients in creating authentic tasks which increase the likelihood of transfer from the learning environment to the job, and the ErgoTrainer prototype is a step in the direction of interactive multimedia training.<BR>

<P>
We have proposed, built, and evaluated a prototype multimedia instructional system, called ErgoTrainer. ErgoTrainer aids students, both students taking classes like the one taught at Georgia Tech and students learning on their own, in gaining basic ergonomic knowledge and learning the skill of job surveillance. The evaluation was successful and the results were positive.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Introduction</CENTER></H2>
<P>
It is important to understand the underlying principles before designing a new system. To that extent this paper first explains the ideas behind the ErgoTrainer prototype. The next section provides a description of the capabilities. The third section discusses the evaluation and results. The paper concludes with observations and conclusions.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Learning Concepts</CENTER></H2>

That is, the student must construct their own understanding of new knowledge. We also believe that this construction happens best in a rich environment which supports learning-by-doing, in which students fail safely but ultimately succeed, and in which their process is scaffolded.
<P>
In order to create this learning environment, we based the design of ErgoTrainer on Schank, Fano, and Jona's goal-based scenario (GBS)[4]. Schank et al. describe GBSs as "problems in the domain of the student's interest that present him with definable goals and encourage learning in service of achieving those goals." In ErgoTrainer, the goal is to perform an ergonomic job analysis and the students need to understand basic ergonomics knowledge to accomplish this goal. This provides an opportunity to tie basic ergonomic knowledge to the task for which it is useful. A goal based scenario is structured around teaching students a skill.

The rich environment was also designed to simulate a real work environment. It is thought that authenticity, that is, a match between the learning environment and the environment in which the skill is to be used, promotes transfer of learned knowledge to the appropriate situation [8]. To achieve this rich environment, a multimedia tool was designed. The subject, ergonomics, is best portrayed in a graphic, and sometimes dynamic, manner. Text, graphics, and videos have been combined to present a realistic ergonomic work environment. The ErgoTrainer prototype is described in the following section.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>ErgoTrainer Description</CENTER></H2>
<P>
ErgoTrainer is instructional courseware designed to teach about tools and processes used to complete an ergonomic job analysis. The user completes a job analysis to determine possible ergonomic hazards in the workplace. In ErgoTrainer, the student analyzes a real industry job, displayed in a video--in this case, a worker cutting chicken nuggets--by completing a checklist identical to one that actual ergonomists use when evaluating workplaces. This checklist is also one recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for identifying hazards in the workplace. The student is lead through the checklist one item at a time.
<P>
In the course of completing the checklist, the student selects and uses job analysis tools, represented by buttons, which are located on the screen at all times. Ergonomic job analysis often requires that specific tools be used to collect information about potentially hazardous activities a worker may engage in and potentially hazardous environments a worker might encounter. The tools provide the student with the information that would be gained if using the tools in the real workplace. For example, when the thermometer button is clicked, the system reports that the temperature is 50 degrees. The job analysis tools in ErgoTrainer consist of: a ruler, a weight scale, a stopwatch, a goniometer (a tool for measuring body angles), a light meter, and a thermometer. ErgoTrainer's introduction identifies each tool for the student at the start of the program. In addition to the tools, the full checklist with an explanation of how to fill it out is displayed during the introduction.
<P>
A Help screen, which briefly describes the tools and their functionality, is available to the student at all times. In addition, a `Hint' button is available to the student as well, which yields information specific to the content of the current checklist item.
<P>
After the introduction, the student encounters the main job analysis screen (see Figure 1), which features a piece of digitized video in the center of the screen that shows a worker cutting chicken nuggets. Independent `Start' and `Stop' buttons allow the student to proceed through the video clip at their own pace. The student uses the tool buttons to gather information for a particular checklist item, then checks a single number on the checklist. In addition to the tools there is a `Job Description' button. When pressed, the job description button gives the student information about the job which can not be obtained from the tool buttons or the video, like the number of hours the job is done and how the worker is paid.<BR><BR>

<H2>Multimedia in Manufacturing Education Laboratory
</H2><P>
The <A 
HREF="http://www.gtri.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech Research
Institute</A> (GTRI) is a not-for-profit applied research organization that is part of the <A 
HREF="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of 
Technology</A>.  Most of our work is funded by state and federal government organizations.  The purpose of the <A 
HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/MiME">Multimedia in
Manufacturing Education Laboratory</A> is to develop innovative learning technologies and to conduct research on the use of these technologies in industrial and educational settings.
<H2>Research Problem
</H2><P>
We are investigating the use of wearable computers to help us with two applied research problems.  The first problem is the collection of real-time quality assurance data by mobile poultry plant workers in a very noisy environment.  The challenges on this project include:
<BR>
<ul>
<li>Providing hands-free operation
<li>Sharing the data in real-time with plant managers
<li>Supporting user comfort 
<li>Allowing audio interactions in a noisy environment
<li>Creating a simple user interface
<li>Keeping costs down.
</ul>
<p>
The second research problem is the performance of a poultry plant water reduction audit by a mobile facilities engineer who may not have conducted such an audit before.  The challenges on this project include:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Providing hands-free operation
<li>Integrating information, software tools, and procedures
<li>Organizing information in a way that is obvious to both novice and expert users
<li>Allowing the user to get support for a task as the user actually performs the task
<li>Allowing the user to learn and control what is learned and when it is learned
<li>Allowing users to enter data in a non-sequential, user-defined order
<li>Providing information using the most appropriate medium
<li>Customizing the procedures and feedback to reflect the steps already completed.
</ul>
<H2>Results
</H2><P>
We developed a customized wearable computer and two software applications.  The first-generation wearable computer consists of:
<br>
<ul>
<li>A compact computer (about the size of a portable cassette player) that the worker wears on a belt.  Combined with our customized applications and a wireless local area network, the computer allows the worker to enter and receive information wherever the worker goes.
<li>A microphone/earphone headset that allows the system to accept voice commands and to provide audio information while protecting the worker's hearing and keeping the worker's hands free for other tasks.
<li>A finger-operated pointing device that can be adjusted easily for right- or left-handed workers.  The cursor positioning and selection device serves as a backup for the voice input system.
<li>A head-mounted display with a tiny computer screen that does not block the worker's vision. The small display allows the worker to continue to work while looking at text, drawings, and videos.
<li>A wireless local area network that allows the worker to send data to and receive data from a central computer in the poultry plant.  The wireless LAN allows the plant manager to see the quality assurance data as it is collected.
</ul>
<br>
<p>
For the quality assurance data problem, we demonstrated the ability of a mobile worker to use voice to enter data using our first-generation wearable computer.  Next, we plan to store the data as a database file, use the wireless local area network to send the data to a computer in the Quality Assurance manager's office, then allow the manager to download it into a spreadsheet.
<p>
For the water reduction audit problem, we are developing a multimedia performance support system that integrates the steps, measurements, and reference material needed to perform a water reduction audit.  The system consists of reference information, just-in-time task-specific training, expert advice on how to complete the tasks, and  automated calculations.  We plan to demonstrate the system to the intended users this summer.
<p>
Also, we plan to continue to refine our wearable computer to make it lighter and more powerful.
<H2>Implications
</H2><P>
Our work has the following implications for wearable computing technology:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Wearable computers may allow mobile workers to collect and transmit real-time data
<li>Wearable computers may provide multimedia information to help mobile workers as they actually perform a task
<li>It may be possible to use voice input to operate wearable computers in noisy environments.
</ul>
<br>
<p>
In the future, wearable computers need to be smaller, lighter, more powerful, more robust, and cheaper.  Voice recognition systems also need to be more accurate.  Finally, after wearable computers and voice recognition systems satisfy these requirements, attention will shift to developing customized, easy-to-use applications that allow users to perform their tasks.

</CENTER>

<BR>
<H2>Problem</H2>
<p>
For training to be effective, it should be consistent with several challenging guidelines. These guidelines include:
<ul>
<li>Give training when the learner needs it.
<li>Give training where (physically) the learner needs it.
<li>Train the learner on only the information that the learner needs.
<li>Allow the learner to control the training.
<li>Use the medium (e.g., text, audio, drawings, video) that most effectively communicates  the information being learned.
<li>Emphasize performance rather than knowledge.
<li>Shorten the time between learning and application.
</ul>
<H2>Solution</H2>
<p>This demonstration/poster will show how we met these challenging guidelines by combining two new technologies.
<H3>Wearable Computer</H3>
<p>
The first new technology is a custom-designed wearable computer.  Figure 1 shows a front view of our wearable computer.  The wearable computer uses an Intel 486 chip running at 75 MHz with 16 MB of RAM, a credit card-sized motherboard, and a 500 MB hard drive.  The computer includes an SVGA video controller, 16 bit sound, and a wireless network.  To power the computer, we developed easy-to-replace, rechargeable, nickel metal hydride battery packs.  We also developed a unique power management system that maximizes battery life and provides battery status to the user.  The computer currently runs the Windows 3.1 operating system.

<br>
<br>
<IMG ALIGN=middle border=1 hspace=5 SRC="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/EPSS/wear2front.gif">
<BR>
<p>
Figure 1.  Front view of wearable computer components.
<p>
The user enters and receives information from the computer using a combination microphone/earphone and a head-mounted, monochrome, 640 x 480 pixel, liquid crystal display. The user utilizes speaker-dependent voice recognition as the primary way to control the computer. The computer sits in a light, water-resistant, waist pack. Including all components, our wearable computer system weighs about 2.4 kg (5.3 pounds).
<p>
Our wearable computer provides many advantages for helping a user to perform tasks. For example, the
<ul>
<li>See-through display allows the user to work while looking at text, drawings, and video
<li>Earphone allows the user to hear explanatory audio narration while looking at information on the display
<li>Miniature microphone, voice recognition software, and our applications allow the user to control the computer via voice so the user's hands are free for other tasks
<li>Computer allows the information designer to use the best medium (e.g., text, graphics, video, sound) to communicate information to the user
<li>Batteries, computer, wireless network, and head-mounted display allow the user to be mobile, getting information when and where the user needs it
<li>Batteries and power management system allow the user to work between four and eight hours at a time without replacing the batteries.
</ul>
<H3>Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS)</H3>
<p>
The second new technology is a new concept in training called an EPSS.  Traditional training systems train the learner before the learner performs the task.  An EPSS trains the learner while the learner performs the task.  To do this, an EPSS uses specialized software that integrates information, tools, and methodologies to help a user perform a specific task.  An EPSS provides this relevant, just-in-time information when the user needs it and when the user asks for it.  This information can include:
<ul>
<li>Just-in-time, task-specific training
<li>Expert advice about a job task
<li>Reference information about a job task or closely related set of tasks
<li>Application help functions
<li>Automated tools for task performance.
</ul>
<p>
During ED-MEDIA 97, we will demonstrate our origami EPSS.  The EPSS teaches users how to fold a paper jumping frog.  We organized the training information in the origami EPSS into the following intuitive categories:
<ul>
<li>A brief description of the training goal
<li>The steps to follow to meet the goal
<li>A tool that helps the user correct his or her work
<li>An on-line library of background information.
</ul>
<p>
Figure 2 shows the main menu of our origami EPSS.

<p>
We will encourage attendees to put on our wearable computer and use the origami EPSS to fold a paper jumping frog.
<H2>Summary</H2>
<p>
Our wearable computer and EPSS give mobile users the training and task support they need, when they need it, where they need it, under the users' control.  Our system also eliminates the gap between learning and applying skills.

These new technologies are most effective when:
&Sigma;	The user needs to learn how to perform specific tasks (as opposed to facts or general concepts).
<ul>
<li>The user performs the tasks infrequently.
<li>The user must be mobile to perform the tasks.
<li>The user's hands must be available to perform the tasks.
<li>The user needs to send and receive information.
<li>Multiple media (e.g., text, drawings, video, sound) make it easier to communicate the information to the user. 
</ul>

<H2>Introduction
</H2><P>
Factory Automation Support Technology (FAST) is a new project for Georgia Tech researchers.  FAST is intended to:  1) train employees as they perform their jobs, rather than before they perform their jobs, and 2) meet the needs of today's mobile work force.  To meet these needs, FAST combines performance support software with wearable hardware.  We hope that this will decrease the amount of nonproductive training time while improving worker performance.
<H2>FAST Performance Support System
</H2><P>
The goal of a performance support system is to provide employees with the right information, in the right quantity and detail, at the right time.  Performance support systems allow less proficient employees to perform as more experienced employees by providing them with appropriate knowledge.  A typical performance support system provides a combination of one or more of the following capabilities:  reference information about a job task or closely related set of tasks; just-in-time, task-specific training; expert advice about a job task; advice on how to use the performance support system effectively; application help functions; and automated tools for task performance.
<H2>FAST Wearable Hardware
</H2><P>
To support mobile workers in factory environments, we are designing and developing special wearable hardware.  This hardware includes:  a small computer that can be worn on a belt which allows for portability and transmission of data in real-time to other computer systems, a visor which is worn like safety glasses to display computer information to the user via a miniaturized CRT, earphones for listening to auditory information provided by the computer, and a microphone to allow for voice-activated, hands-free operation of the computer.  This hardware enables workers to get information at the task site and, since their hands are not tied up operating the computer, to continue to perform the task as they are receiving the information. This equipment enhances the software-based performance support system by making it accessible to employees at all times.  We hope that the convenience, comfort, and helpfulness of FAST will encourage employees to want to use the system.
<H2>Summary
</H2><P>
This project addresses several research issues including:  how do you combine training and performance support for both novices and experts, how do you integrate a computer tool into a non-computer task, and does combining training and performance support increase the transfer of learning from training to work?  A FAST demonstration has been implemented and work on a real system for the poultry industry has begun.  The project is a partnership between the Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Georgia poultry industry.

<H2>Project Description</H2>
This focus of this project is on developing interactive learning systems for use in manufacturing education both at Georgia Tech and within industry.  Specific projects will be identified through a team approach of students, faculty, industry, and designers.  Our current ideas revolve around design education employing case histories and interactive simulation.<P>

Our foundation for these efforts is based on the belief that learning is a constructive process in which the learner builds a personal representation of the world around him or her.  This internal construction occurs primarily through experience that is ideally situated in rich context.  It is our intention to employ technology to create greater opportunities for students to experience the real context of manufacturing systems and thus encourage transfer and connection of classroom based instruction to the real world.

<A NAME="intro"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>
Traditional classroom based engineering education often falls short of preparing students for the complete process of manufacturing -- that is the complete cycle of design, engineering, production, marketing, and delivery of goods.  Some of these shortfalls include:<P>


*	Restricted access to practicing manufacturing experts because of the high cost of bringing them to the classroom, limited individual availability, and the logistical impossibility of actual plant visits.<P>


*	Curriculum demands which do not permit the inclusion of rapidly emerging issues such as open engineering systems, environmentally aware manufacturing, or information enabled manufacturing.<P>
<p>
*	Few opportunities to experience or participate in an actual manufacturing process first hand while in school.
<p>
We propose to address the above shortfalls through rapid development and deployment of a technology enabled curriculum (TEC).  Advanced media technologies will be exploited to create virtual, time shifted, and/or remote visits to real world manufacturing systems.  Through the power of interactive multimedia and advanced telecommunications students will be enabled to directly participate as members of actual engineering design teams while remaining at school.
<P>
	
Our foundation for these efforts is based on the belief that learning is a constructive process in which the learner builds a personal representation of the world around him or her.  This internal construction occurs primarily through experience which is ideally situated in rich context.  It is our intention to employ technology to create greater opportunities for students to experience the real context of manufacturing systems and thus encourage the transfer and connection of classroom based instruction to the real world.<P>

	
Exploitation of advanced information technology for engineering education at the university level has been limited to date even though a great deal of research has confirmed the advantages of such an approach.  The few attempts which have been made for engineering education in general remain focused on specific disciplines such as physics, electrical engineering, or mechanics.  This program represents the first attempt to apply interactive educational technology across a complete multidisciplinary engineering curriculum .  This project proposes to leap-frog traditional instructional methods and create the infrastructure and resources necessary to assure engineering/manufacturing education remains at the forefront of innovation.  Many experts believe that life-long self-paced learning through interactive media represents the future.  We propose to lead the way in engineering/manufacturing education.<P>

	
In short, our goal is to revolutionize the engineering/manufacturing educational process on a local and eventually national level through the exploitation of the latest advances in instructional technology, learning theory, and multimedia systems.  Our approach radically reaches forward to focus on the rapid development and deployment of learner-centered technology enabled curriculum materials throughout the entire engineering/manufacturing curriculum.<P>



<A NAME="ap"><H3>Activities Planned</H3></A><P>

	
Three main activities are proposed in this program: the creation of a manufacturing focused multimedia development resource, rapid infusion of educational technology into the manufacturing curriculum, and the production and dissemination of interactive courseware.  Much of the infrastructure is already in place at Georgia Tech necessary to realize these goals including appropriate personnel, specialized hardware and software, management system, and commitment to multimedia based instruction.  What is needed is an interdisciplinary campus wide effort focused specifically on the needs of manufacturing education.  MIME will serve as the focal point for such an effort.<P>

	
Initial projects to be undertaken will be closely linked with new and existing degree programs across the entire campus.  Curriculum needs of these programs will drive all research and development efforts.  The first task to be undertaken will focus on conducting a thorough needs analysis of manufacturing education and subsequently identifying those needs which can be best met through technology.  Or goal is for real learning needs to drive the technology rather than the technology driving the learning.<P>



<A NAME="ctme"><H3>Commitment To Manufacturing Education</H3></A><P>

	
Georgia Tech (GT) has a long history of involvement in manufacturing engineering education.  Recently, GT was ranked as the number one university in manufacturing education by U.S.  News & World Reports.  This achievement was made possible by an across the board commitment of the administration and the State of Georgia to focus on manufacturing education and research and development.  In November of 1991 the $15 million, 120,000 square foot Manufacturing Research Center was officially opened.  Funding for the project continues to come from a combination of state and industry matching funds.  An additional $40 million Manufacturing Related Disciplines Complex dedicated to manufacturing education is schedule to begin construction in the near future.  GT also serves as a model in industry/university partnering through its multi-university/industry Material Handling Research Center (MHRC) and Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems (CIMS) graduate certificate program.<P>

	
Through these programs Georgia Tech has over ten years of experience in interdisciplinary manufacturing related education. The CIMS program continues to serve as the focus for these efforts awarding over 500 graduate certificates to date. Current enrollment stands at approximately 200 and involves 25% of the faculty across nine academic units. This program continues to be funded through a consortia of industry representatives and will serve as a solid foundation for future efforts such as this proposal.<P>



<A NAME="in"><H3>Innovativeness</H3></A><P>

	
Exploitation of advanced information technology for manufacturing education at the university level has been virtually non-existent to date even though a great deal of research has confirmed the advantages of such an approach.  The few attempts which have been made for engineering education in general remain focused on specific disciplines such as physics, electrical engineering, or mechanics.  MIME represents the first attempt to apply interactive educational technology across a complete multidisciplinary curriculum such as manufacturing.  This project proposes to leap-frog traditional instructional methods and create the infrastructure and resources necessary to assure manufacturing education remains at the forefront of innovation.  Many experts believe that life-long self-paced learning through interactive media represents the future.  We propose to lead the way in manufacturing education.<P>

	
Another innovation lies in our intention to make all materials produced available for low-cost delivery.  We intend to exploit recent advancements in consumer oriented playback systems to ensure that required hardware investments do not limit the acceptance and rapid dissemination of the materials produced.  A hierarchical delivery model is planned whereby emerging multimedia standards are employed to allow creation of interactive courseware which allows increasing levels of user interactivity depending on the capabilities of the host platform.  In this way initial materials can developed rapidly, released for immediate use, and later enhanced as the technology evolves and time permits.<P>



<A NAME="tp"><H3>Target Populations</H3></A><P>

	
Realizing that many defense workers may be unable directly attend a university, a remote instructional delivery mechanism is required.  Multimedia-based instruction by its' digital nature offers new opportunities to address remote, distant, or otherwise restricted populations such as this.  By focusing entirely on electronic delivery all materials will be immediately available for study at defense industry locations at the convenience of the students.  By coordinating and integrating materials development with new and existing manufacturing curriculums it will be possible to offer academic credit for completed coursework.  Initial demonstration projects include a focus on the needs of students returning to school from the defense industry.  At least one project will provide a means to identify specific areas of expertise for which advanced placement or credit may be appropriate as well as to deliver refresher material.  In this manner defense engineers will receive maximum credit for their work experience while also creating a study plan tailored to their specific needs and interests.
	Currently Georgia Tech stands as the national leader in awarding engineering degrees to women, second behind the University of Puerto Rico in awarding engineering degrees to underrepresented minorities, and behind only Howard and North Carolina AT&T in awarding engineering degrees to African Americans.  Such diversity offers tremendous opportunity to attract members of underrepresented minorities into manufacturing engineering as a career.<P>


Equally important is the recruitment of women and members of underrepresented minority groups into the manufacturing profession.  Graduate students from these groups will be actively recruited and special attention will be placed on their retention.  Also, one of our collaborators, Dr. Erika Rogers, is a faculty member at Clark Atlanta University, one of the nation's prominent black universities.  One aspect of that collaboration will be to facilitate graduate recruitment from CAU's student population.  We will also make a special effort in the creation of electronic materials (e.g., multimedia-based video interviews and images) to represent a cross-section of the nation's population, including women and people of color. <P>



<A NAME="ii"><H3>Industry Involvement</H3></A><P>

	
Industry will be actively involved in all phases of this program through existing partnerships already in place at Georgia Tech.  These alliances include major manufacturing companies which are currently committing significant financial and personnel resources to manufacturing related programs at Georgia Tech.  Industry advisory board members from both the CIMS program and the MARC program will serve as both as project reviewers and field participants as required.<P>



<A NAME="mdt"><H3>Multi-Disciplinary Teams</H3></A><P>

	
It is anticipated that faculty from nearly every department on campus will have a stake in this program either as a developer or user of materials developed under this program.  Faculty from the schools of mechanical, electrical, industrial, and civil engineering have already expressed interest in participating in the activities of MIME.  Additional faculty from architecture, literature culture and communication, and the college of computing have also expressed a desire to play a role.  Exact participants will be identified through an assessment process whereby real learning needs are identified.  Manufacturing by its' very nature requires a broad multi-disciplinary approach as evidenced by campus wide CIMS certificate program already in existence.<P>



<A NAME="pi"><H3>Problem Identified</H3></A><P>

	
Manufacturing by its' vary nature is a broad multidisciplinary field requiring general knowledge of the entire enterprise including the design, production, and delivery of finished products.  The manufacturing engineer requires knowledge from the diverse fields of robotics, materials, CAD/CAM, communication systems, budgeting, management, continuous quality improvement, and training the workforce.  Integrating this knowledge is a formidable task requiring a balance of technical depth with a broad understanding of the problems facing industry.  Equally important is an understanding of the collaborative team-oriented approach of real-world problem solving.<P>

	
Today, it is nearly impossible to provide a student with the required breadth of experience required while including time for in-depth study of any emerging issues.  Often decisions have to be made to limit the classroom time spent studying any particular topic.  As a result, little time is left for students to connect what they hear in the classroom with the real manufacturing world.  What is needed is a new instructional medium which allows the students to interact with real world manufacturing issues in an off-line, out of class manner without the presence of an instructor.  Students need experience applying the concepts presented in the classroom before they reach the actual manufacturing floor.<P>

	
Additionally, changing pressures in society continually present new issues which should be dealt with during the educational experience.  Examples of such issues include manufacturing ethics, environmentally friendly production processes, interactive consumer technologies and their effect on production, team building, rapid prototype design, self-directed work groups, and the life-long training of the workforce to name a few.  Current curriculum constraints simply do not permit all of these topics to be covered in the traditional classroom; yet, many of these exact topics have been identified as issues crucial to the future success of American manufacturing.  <P>
Finally, education is undergoing a technological revolution of its' own as many educators search for ways to enhance learning through the wise application of interactive information systems.  Surprisingly, much of this effort to date has not occurred in higher education even though many universities are better equipped technology wise than their lower grade counterparts.  In particular, the literature is almost completely free of attempts to incorporate interactive learning technology into manufacturing education.<P>


Recently McDermott (1993) summed many of the shortcomings of traditional classroom based technical education with the following list of observations on teaching and learning:<P>



*	Ability to solve standard quantitative problems is not adequate criterion of functional understanding.  Even though the criterion for functional understanding is often measured by the ability of a student to solve quantitative problems, there is little correlation between this type of performance and the ability to solve real-world previously unencountered problems.<P>


*	Traditional instruction does not generally produce a coherent conceptual framework in students for relating a number of concepts.   To apply a concept in a variety of contexts students must not only be able to define the concept but equally important they must be able to relate it to associated concepts while differentiating it from others.<P>


*	Many conceptual misunderstandings are not overcome by traditional instruction.  Instead, students must be challenged multiple times to resolve their misunderstandings.  They need time and opportunity to apply the same concepts in many contexts, to reflect upon their experience and to generalize from the results.<P>


*	Traditional instruction does not usually result in growth of general reasoning ability.  Often students perceive a topic as a collection of facts and formulas and do not recognize the critical role of reasoning in applying this information.  They are unlikely to change unless the course material is presented such that this ability is cultivated.<P>


*	Connections between concepts, formal representations, and the real world are often lacking at the conclusion of traditional instruction.  Students need repeated practice in applying their conceptual knowledge to the real world.<P>


*	Teaching by telling, traditional lecture, is an ineffective means of instruction for most students.  Instead, every student must become an active participant in his or her education.  No matter how accomplished a lecturer might be, meaningful learning will not occur if students are not intellectually active and involved in what they are studying.<P>


	
Educating the next generation of manufacturing engineers through traditional educational techniques alone exaggerates all of the above problems and concerns.  For manufacturing is ultimately concerned with using real live processes and equipment to create real products. The effective manufacturing engineer must develop a strong conceptual link between what he or she hears in the classroom and what really goes on in the real world.  <P>


 

<A NAME="oebwm"><H3>Overcoming Educational Barriers With Multimedia</H3></A><P>
 
	
Obviously educational change is needed.  Many have hailed interactive multimedia as the saving grace of education in the United States.  Interactive multimedia is revolutionizing the way people work, communicate, and most importantly learn.  By combining text, graphics, animation, simulation, sound, and video multimedia applications engage people from multiple perspectives by touching many senses at one time.  Additionally, since the technology is computer based, this new medium offers rich interactive capabilities previously unavailable in any communication medium.  Although a variety of delivery systems are available the typical interactive multimedia platform is based on industry standard computers connected to a number of media sources such as CD-ROM, CDI, DVI, videodisc, interactive television, or a network link.  Hardware systems capable of supporting interactive applications are becoming readily available throughout business, campus communities and increasingly the home.<P>

	
Research has shown that people differ considerably in the manner they learn best.  Some respond to highly structured presentations, others prefer free-form exploration.  Some people are highly visually oriented while others are best served through auditory presentation.  Suffice it to say that no two individuals possess the exact same learning style.  Interactive multimedia allows the student to select that form of presentation which suits him or her individually.  It has been said that people remember:<P>


<EM>	20% of what they see,<P>

	
40% of what they see and hear,<P>

	
70% of what they see, hear, and do
</EM><P>


Interactive multimedia provides a medium which takes maximum advantage of the way people learn by offering opportunities to do all of the above.<P>


Instructionally sound application of this new media offers a cost-effective method to relieve many of the bottlenecks in manufacturing education discussed.  Research has shown that delivering instruction through multimedia learning typically occurs 38-70% faster than through traditional teaching methods.  Additionally, learners show significant gains in understanding, transference to the real world, and long-term retention. Finally, the digital nature of the technology allows an instructor to rapidly incorporate current events and issues into the curriculum in near real time.<P>

	 
Many institutions experimenting with this new educational tool have discovered that other positive side-effects result from its' use.  Multimedia delivery of instruction forces the students to take greater responsibility for his or her learning than traditional classroom based instruction.  This occurs due to the self-paced self-directed nature of the medium.  As a result, the technology becomes a catalyst to true educational reform whereby the teacher assumes the role of coach and mentor rather than sole information provider. In the end many students experience significant increases in motivation and go on to seek out material beyond the requirements of a class.<P>

	
 	
Another advantage this new instructional media offers is the power of interactivity with people, events, and systems which are otherwise unavailable to the average student.  For example consider the case of a seminar with Dr. Edward's Deeming the renowned expert on quality.  Few people ever have the opportunity to interact with him personally.  Interactive multimedia could be used to simulate such an interaction allowing a student to compose his or her own questions to explore with Dr. Deeming.  Through the power of interactive video technology a response could be selected from an indexed collection of similar questions and a short video of Dr. Deeming responding to the question displayed.  Or suppose a teacher is discussing new electronics assembly procedures for surface mount devices.   Traditional instruction would offer a reference to a recent article on the subject.  The technology enabled curriculum might instead provide an exploratory hypermedia reference document which allows the student to search a number of articles, view both still and motion video of the actual process, and electronically store an indexed set of notes for later recall.<P>

	
In summary, the benefits of interactive multimedia applicable to a practice oriented manufacturing curriculum include:<P>



*	Per user cost of delivery reduced over lifetime of course.<P>


*	Overall mastery of subject material substantially increased.<P>


*	Remote delivery possible.<P>


*	Access as needed rather than when provided.<P>


*	Significant reduction in time to master subject matter.<P>

*	Collaborative design and development required.<P>


*	Realistic simulation of actual manufacturing processes possible.<P>


*	Rapid update and inclusion of current material.<P>


*	Consistent presentation of subject matter regardless of instructor.<P>


*	Rapid widespread distribution through electronic networks.<P>




<A NAME="mime"><H2>Multimedia in Manufacturing Education (MIME)</H2></A><P>
<p>	
Why then has higher education not endorsed multimedia-based instruction with open arms?  In fact many institutions are attempting to do just that; however, the development of quality engaging courseware has proven to require a completely new approach to teaching as well as new technical skills.  Interactive multimedia development differs dramatically from traditional text or note preparation.  Literature abounds with well intentioned examples of multimedia projects which succeed technically demonstrating the latest bells and whistles of interactive video, digital teleconferencing, or high speed networking yet fail to instruct in a meaningful way.  Clearly more than just technology expertise is needed.  Clearly the problem involves more than just hardware and software.  Many faculty are eager to take advantage of multimedia but do not possess the time, skill, knowledge, or resources to do so.  Help is needed.    <p>	
In order to realize the full potential of interactive multimedia for manufacturing education we propose to create a national resource dedicated to rapidly producing manufacturing related multimedia-based courseware which is tightly integrated with existing multidisciplinary manufacturing education programs.  This resource will be staffed with a renaissance team of professionals dedicated solely to maximizing the effectiveness of multimedia based education.  Coupled with extensive evaluation and research such a program offers the potential to significantly enhance manufacturing education on a national level.<p>	
This resource center will be known as MIME (Multimedia In Manufacturing Education), a multimedia courseware research and development organization dedicated to meeting the needs of interdisciplinary manufacturing education including:<p><p>
*	Enhancement of new and existing manufacturing curricula through the addition of self-paced non-traditional interactive educational software.<p>
*	Creation of the infrastructure necessary to deliver manufacturing related course material on-site at defense industry facilities through self-study interactive courses.<p>
*	Supporting faculty in the creation and use of educational technologies for manufacturing education.<p>
*	Teaching future manufacturing engineers how to use multimedia technology to train the future workforce and communicate effectively.<p>
*	Demonstration of the effectiveness of learning theory centered multimedia-based instruction across the entire manufacturing education curriculum.<p>
*	Improving the effectiveness of interactive media-based engineering instruction in general.  <p>
*	Providing a dedicated multimedia production facility for manufacturing related courseware development.  <p>
*	Addressing the individual needs of various groups of students regardless of their backgrounds.<p>
*	Increasing the opportunity to build interpersonal team skills.<p>
*	Focusing on development of process oriented higher order problem solving skills development.<p><p>	
Specifically, we propose to create a dedicated resource center staffed by a small number of professionals skilled in the design, development, and evaluation of learner-centered interactive multimedia.  This staff will then work with groups of graduate students and faculty to implement a demonstration set of manufacturing related curricular materials employing multimedia in an instructionally sound and consistent manner.  Once completed, the educational materials will be disseminated widely and lessons learned will be shared with other institutions.<p> 	
An investment in research to advance the current capabilities of interactive multimedia technology is also planned.  One of the limitations of current multimedia systems for education, however, is that they emphasize a ``browsing'' paradigm.  That is, they are designed primarily to allow the user to navigate through subject-related resource material in an engaging and informative manner.  A more powerful use of this technology is to embed it in an intelligent tutoring system designed for the manufacturing curriculum.  <p>
Such a program would pose interactive problem-solving situations appropriate to the level of the student, and assist him/her in the completion of graded assignments.  The advantages of such an approach are many.  The use of stand-alone technology allows the student to work at his/her own pace.  However, more importantly, the development of such an intelligent multimedia tutor allows students to work on a large variety of real-world manufacturing problems, without requiring the physical presence of the instructor.<p>	The program would not only present questions, and supplementary resource materials, but, through its intelligent interaction, would help to guide the student through the reasoning process, giving advice, or redirecting the student's focus-of-attention at appropriate times. The nature of the student's errors or misunderstandings would guide the type of assistance provided, and the system would employ its multimedia capabilities in a manner that would be most helpful to the student at the time. <p>	
In order to provide a mechanism to assist and enhance the student's learning experience with this type of technology, it is important to have a strong cognitive foundation.  Since multimedia emphasizes visual information as well as text-based information, it is important to understand the relationship between the student's perceptual and problem-solving capabilities, and how to exploit this knowledge to present information in a manner which leads to improved student performance.  This suggests two needs:  1) a methodology for quickly extracting information about how students learn this particular type of material and 2) a mechanism for easily incorporating the resultant knowledge into an intelligent tutoring system.  	<p>	
Both of these needs can be addressed to a great extent by research which has already been conducted in building a Visual Interaction Assistance system (VIA, Rogers, 1992).   This system was designed to provide intelligent assistance in a visual reasoning task, and is based on a cognitive model of the interaction between perception and problem-solving employed in such a task.  Although VIA emphasizes actual problem-solving rather than teaching problem-solving, the experimental methodology developed for collecting and analyzing protocol data, the cognitive model itself, and the blackboard-style design of the system provide solid foundations for extension to an intelligent multimedia tutoring environment. <p> 

<A NAME="ci"><H3>Curriculum Integration</H3></A><p>	
To achieve any measure of success the products of MIME must be designed as integral components of the manufacturing curriculum.  The creation of the new product realization degree program at Georgia Tech coupled with the existing experience in manufacturing education offers an unusual opportunity to meet this goal.  As teams of interdisciplinary faculty meet and design the new courses required for these programs, MIME representatives will work as active members of the same teams.  Projects will be formalized employing multimedia technology to best meet the instructional objectives/needs of particular courses rather than to simply demonstrate the power of the technology.  This will insure that the maximum benefit of the technology is achieved as well as provide an opportunity for the instructors to buy into the concept of Technology Enabled Curriculum (TEC).  <p>	
In order to insure that the instructional materials produced match the needs of the curriculum the following instructional systems design (ISD) iterative model will be used in creating the multimedia materials:<p>	
This model consists of five interrelated phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation.  The dotted lines show that the process is iterative in nature and not a completely linear process.  As the instructional system progresses the designer must move back and forth among the various phases of development.  The lines from the evaluation phase lead to all other phases such that adjustments are made to the course where needed.  Just as for any system to work well all of its' parts must be compatible and work towards the same goal, so must instructional programs. Taking a systems approach to instructional development will ensure that all the parts of the curriculum function as a dynamic integrated whole.<p> 

<A NAME="dopt"><H3>Description of Project Tasks</H3></A><p>	
A phased approach to the problem is planned consisting of first assembling the necessary dedicated resources.  Second, work will begin on the development of an initial demonstration application while working with curriculum committees to identify additional projects.  Third, an assessment and evaluation of the completed demonstrations and the development process will be conducted.  As a final phase we will begin to disseminate the materials to other institutions and produce a plan for continued efforts.<p><p>

<A NAME="p1"><H4>Phase 1 - Resource Coordination - Needs Assessment</H4></A><p>	
The initial phase of this program will consist of assembling the necessary resources which must be dedicated to MIME.  This effort will mainly consist of outfitting a small development laboratory with the hardware and software necessary to produce the instructional multimedia materials.  This will include at least two separate development stations, a desktop video editing facility, a color flat bed scanner, video/audio digitization hardware, audio editing hardware and software, appropriate recording equipment, graphics, digital photo, and digital video editing software, and a multi-platform authoring package such as Authorware Professional or Director.  The emphasis will be on developing only that capability which must be dedicated to this effort.  Specialized imaging or animation workstations are available in other locations across campus.  Since the need for access to this type of high end equipment will be intermittent, we do not intend to duplicate such resources.  <p>	
Although much of the equipment required to produce the multimedia materials are already available at different locations throughout Georgia Tech, none are dedicated to manufacturing education. Experience has shown that shared access works well for small efforts; however, the mission of MIME mandates a core of dedicated resources.<p>	
Our goal is to develop materials which can be easily distributed to other locations throughout the country and require a minimal investment in multimedia hardware to run.  Additionally, we hope to serve as a model for other institutions in showing the way to develop instructional multimedia with only small investments in additional infrastructure.  Our intention is to exploit the capabilities of multimedia technology without limiting future access because of unrealistic playback hardware expectations and/or requirements.<p>	
Additionally, we will conduct a thorough learning needs assessment of manufacturing education with input from students, alumni, faculty, and industry.  From this information we will identify specific learning needs best addressed  through interactive multimedia.  Only after this assessment is complete will we begin working on specific projects.<p> 

<A NAME="p2"><H4>Phase 2 - Demonstration Applications</H4></A><p>	
The next phase of the program will consist the of identifying and producing the first demonstration application.  Initially, a number of targeted projects are imagined to demonstrate the effectiveness of this innovative approach to manufacturing education:<p><p>
*	Infusion of manufacturing Experts Into The Classroom (EITC) through case-based presentation and dialogue with leading manufacturing engineers discussing real world issues.  This will allow the normal seminar type course to be delivered remotely as needed and in greater depth as normal time constraints are extended.<p>
*	Development of interactive pre-assessment and refresher materials to be used at defense industry sites by experienced engineers returning to graduate school.<p>
*	Interactive practice oriented case studies of contemporary manufacturing issues such as environmental awareness, ethical practice, and self-directed work teams.<p>
*	Simulated interactive design review and evaluation using intelligent virtual characters and interactive video.<p>
*	Computer enabled design collaboration using the new high tech media enabled classroom described in the companion proposal.<p>	
EITC interactive case study development is envisioned as the initial project undertaking.  We choose to focus on this area for a number of reasons: 1) a broad cross curriculum immediate need for this type of material, 2) potential for rapid access to the needed experts through existing corporate partners with Georgia Tech, 3) availability of supporting media resources from the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME).  As part of this project we propose to work with the SME to adapt much of their large existing instructional film library to an interactive format and to update it with new material developed as part of this program.  This will not be a simple conversion of one media to another.  Instead, the real advancement will come from maximizing the interactivity of the presentation and the inclusion of in-depth supporting materials.  The focus will be on explicitly defining the connection between the concepts taught in the classroom and their real world application.   <p>
As a first step it is imagined that the initial release of this material will be designed for minimal playback hardware requirements.  The recent introductions of consumer oriented technologies such as Compact Disc Interactive (CDI), PhotoCD, and SegaCD offer to drastically lower the cost of delivery and hence the barriers to widespread use of educational multimedia.  A side benefit to the  consumerization of multimedia has been the advent of the first true multi-platform delivery standards such as MPEG-1 for digital motion video,  (CDI) for combining CD quality audio with interactive graphics and digital video, and the rapid acceptance of the low-cost SegaCD home gaming system.  As part of our effort to obtain matching funds we will explore formal relationships with many multimedia providers.   <p>	
All other project formulations will be made in conjunction with interdisciplinary curriculum development teams.  History has shown that very little if any improvement in education will result from the use of technology if the development is done without the direct faculty involvement.<p>

<A NAME="p3"><H4>Phase 3 - Evaluation/Assessment</H4></A><p>	
Many educators have accepted the notion that multimedia automatically increases learning by its' very nature.  Many commercial products extol the advantages of learning with multimedia and virtually guarantee increased comprehension, reduced learning time, and greater motivation for any subject presented with multimedia.  Obviously this notion is overly simplistic. Reeves (1992) states, " Interactive Multimedia cannot guarantee learning any more than a library in a school can guarantee learning."   Although this new instructional media offers truly revolutionary   capabilities it is only through intelligent design and execution will learning be enhanced.  <p>	
As part of this overall program it is necessary to evaluate/assess the multimedia materials from two separate viewpoints.  The first form of evaluation should focus on insuring that the materials developed are usable by the targeted population.  Information uncovered from these early tests will then guide the authors in revising the user interface design of the presentation.  This type of evaluation is known as formative evaluation and is best conducted throughout the entire development cycle.  Effort in this direction shapes the final product to meet the immediate needs of the intended user audience.<p>	
Crismond and Wilson (1992) have developed an extensive evaluation tool at MIT to examine the effects on learning for the Engineering Design Instructional Computer System created at MIT.  The goal of this type of evaluation/assessment is totally learning centered.  Rather than focus on the media itself the examiner probes what kind of learning takes place.  This requires comparing the performance of various groups subjected to different treatments of the subject.  Here the goal is not to compare one media to another (i.e. text vs. multimedia) but instead to determine what the students are actually learning and how does this compare to the original objectives.  Such a test is typically based on analyzing the results from pre and post tests before and after the study period.  Results from such a study are again used to revise the instructional materials and optimize the entire system for maximum learning.<p>	
Throughout this phase of the project an effort will be made to include representatives from industry both as reviewers and learners.  It is important to understand all targeted audiences especially those at remote defense industry locations.<p> 

<A NAME="p4"><H4>Phase 4 - Dissemination and Adoption</H4></A><p>	
Initially, our primary objective is to develop multimedia materials which impact manufacturing education here at Georgia Tech.  This institution has already developed a strong philosophical commitment to technology enabled curriculum; however, little concrete deployment has yet to occur.  MIME will serve as the local leader in this area as it completes projects destined for the many academic disciplines involved in manufacturing.  Students will benefit from not only the specific materials created under this project but more importantly from an overall change in teaching.  As faculty involved in manufacturing adopt the concept of technology enabled curriculum they will be encouraged and supported to become departmental advocates.  MIME will work with these faculty to improve other manufacturing related courses eventually empowering the faculty themselves to develop much of their own TEC material in the future.  The impact will then extend far beyond those directly involved in this specific program.<p>	
Also, all course materials will eventually be packaged for transfer to other institutions and for use by defense industry personnel in remote locations.  To support this effort complete user and facilitator documentation will be developed to accompany the multimedia courseware.  The material will then be distributed through the educational efforts of various professional societies such as SME, ASME, and IEEE.  Other commercial distribution organizations such as Intellimation and EduCorp will also be given the opportunity to distribute the materials.  Wherever possible materials suitable for distribution electronically will be posted to the appropriate servers on Internet.  Finally, lessons learned in all phases of this project will be published widely and informal assistance offered to others wishing to do similar curriculum development.<p>	<p>

<H2>Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS)
</H2><P>
An electronic performance support system (EPSS) is customized software that
integrates information, tools, and procedures to help users as they actually
perform a task.  A typical performance support system provides a combination
of the following capabilities:
<BR>
<UL><LI>Just-in-time, task-specific information such as step-by-step procedures
<LI>Reference information, such as machine specifications, for a job task
<LI>Expert advice about a job task
<LI>Automated tools to help the user perform tasks.

</H2><P>
Our team created a simple multimedia EPSS to teach users how to fold a Japanese
paper jumping frog.  The media we used included text, drawings, audio narration,
and videos.  To free the user's hands while folding the paper, we provided
a voice recognition interface to the EPSS.

We organized the information into sections that provided the step-by-step
procedure for folding the paper jumping frog, assistance with correcting
problems, and background information on origami.

<H2>Abstract
</H2><P>
An electronic performance support system (EPSS) uses technology to integrate
procedures, information, and tools to help users perform a task.  An EPSS
gives its users the information the users need to perform a task as they
actually perform the task.  This paper describes the process, hardware, and
software that our team used to create a simple origami EPSS.  This paper
also describes the rationale behind our design decisions and lists the lessons
that we learned from this experience.
<H2>Introduction
</H2><P>
This paper describes how our team developed a simple EPSS.  An EPSS integrates
procedures, information, and tools to help users as they perform a task (Gery,
1991).  A typical training system trains a person away from the job before
the person needs the training.  An EPSS gives people the information they
need when and where they need it -- on the job.
<P>
Our EPSS had two purposes:
<BR>
<OL><LI>To demonstrate to visitors and prospective customers a simple EPSS,
and
<LI>To give us experience using the technology needed to create multimedia
EPSSs.
</OL><P>
We wanted our demonstration EPSS to teach an unfamiliar, fun, slightly complex
task.  We decided to build a demonstration EPSS to help teach users how to
do origami, the ancient Japanese art of paper-folding.  The goal of our system
was to allow users to learn to fold a simple jumping frog.
<P>
After selecting the task that we wanted our EPSS to teach, we used paper
and pencil to sketch out the main menu and options that we wanted to include.
 The main menu included selections for learning which skill the system taught
("What do I do?"), the steps for performing the skill ("How do I do it?"),
support for de-bugging the user's performance ("Is this right?"), and a library
of background information on origami ("Origami library").  Paper and pencil
allowed us to show our ideas to other team members and to quickly, easily,
and cheaply make changes to the general design.
<P>
Our next step was to create a computer-based skeleton of our design.  Since
we (1) planned to use our system for educational (rather than presentation)
purposes, (2) wanted to include multimedia, and (3) wanted our system to
run on both Apple Macintosh and IBM-compatible personal computers, we selected
Macromedia Authorware for Macintosh as our authoring software.  Using Authorware
on an Apple Power Macintosh 8100/80AV, we laid out our main menu and some
of the more obvious sub-menus.  The main menu is shown in Figure 1.
<BR>
<BR>

SRC="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/imb/gifs/OrigMainMenu.gif">
<BR>

<P>
Since the heart of the EPSS was the steps
for folding the jumping frog, we began assembling the material that we wanted
to include in this section.  In our first attempt, we used Claris MacDraw
Pro and Aldus SuperPaint to begin drawing each of the steps in the jumping
frog paper-folding process.  We believed that by having complete control
over each drawing, we could simplify the drawings (origami uses unusual,
special instructional arrows) and add new drawings that might be helpful.
<P>
However, this technique proved to be painfully slow, and we soon decided
to simply scan in the drawings that we needed rather than re-create each
drawing ourselves.  We scanned the black and white drawings from our origami
book into an Apple Power Macintosh 7100/66AV using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet
IIc and Adobe Photoshop software.  After we scanned in the drawings, we rotated
each drawing to the proper angle, removed stray marks, improved the contrast,
and increased the image size.  We saved each image as a pict file and used
our network to import the images into our Authorware application.  We also
added controls to allow the user to move sequentially between drawings ("Next,"
"Previous"), to return to the main menu ("Main Menu"), and to exit the
application ("Quit").
<P>
It became clear, though, that we needed to supplement the drawings with verbal
instructions.  However, adding text to the display did not make sense because
the displayed text would not allow users to look at the drawing while reading
the verbal instructions.  So, we used Motion Works International SoundMate,
VideoFusion QuickFlix, and an Apple Macintosh microphone to record auditory
verbal instructions for making the fold shown in each drawing.  Then we used
Authorware to attach the auditory instructions to each drawing.  When the
user moved to each drawing in the jumping frog paper-folding process, the
audio instructions played automatically.  These media allowed the user to
look at the drawing while simultaneously hearing the verbal instructions.
 Figure 2 shows the drawing for making the fold for step 1.  The figure includes
the "Show Video" button that was added later.

<BR>

<P>
We soon realized, however, that we were using static drawings to show a
motion-based procedure.  The static drawings allowed a user to dwell on a
drawing of a fold until the user understood it.  However, we thought that
there might be some learning advantages to providing to the user a video
of someone actually making the fold that the user had to make.  So, we used
QuickFlix and a VideoLabs FlexCam NTSC camera to record a three minute video
of one of us using office paper to fold the paper jumping frog.  We also
used QuickFlix to copy in the auditory instructions for each step of the
paper-folding process.  
<P>
Then we imported the file into Authorware and broke the file into 11 audio-video
segments that matched each of the 11 steps shown in the static drawings.
 Using Authorware, we connected the audio-video segments to the screen that
showed each drawing.  On each screen, we also added a "Show Video" button
to allow the user to see the video for that drawing.  So, the user could
(1) look at the static drawing for a fold while hearing the audio instructions,
and (2) look at a video showing the fold actually being made while hearing
the audio instructions.  To allow the user to stop the video, we also added
a "Clear Video" button to the screen whenever the user played a video.
<P>
However, we were not satisfied with our video.  We wanted to replace it with
a video showing someone folding brightly-colored, traditional origami paper
rather than plain white office paper.  Origami paper is differently colored
on the front and back of the paper, so we thought that it might be easier
to understand a fold that was shown using origami paper rather than a fold
that was shown using office paper.  We also wanted to insert pauses into
the video so that the user could hear part of the instructions for making
a fold before the video began showing the fold.  So, we used QuickFlix and
the VideoLabs camera to re-shoot the video using origami paper.  We imported
the file into Adobe Premiere because it has more advanced video editing features
than QuickFlix.  Then we inserted short (e.g., two second) pauses where needed
to allow the audio instructions for a fold to start before the video began
showing the fold.  Figure 3 shows an image from a video.
<BR>

<BR>

<P>
After reviewing the improved video, we realized that there were many long
periods of boring, slightly eerie silence between audio instructions.  To
be consistent with our origami theme, we decided to add to the video a background
audio track of traditional Japanese music.  We used Optical Media International's
Disc-to-Disk to transfer a song from a compact disk of traditional Japanese
music to our computer.  Then we imported the song into Premiere, set it up
to play simultaneously with our narrated audio track, adjusted its volume
so that it could be heard without drowning out the audio instructions, and
trimmed its length to match that of our video.  When we demonstrated our
work to our colleagues, most people thought the song was too slow and sleepy.
 This was not surprising since the song was a traditional Japanese lullaby.
 So, we repeated the procedure and replaced the song with a more upbeat tune.
<P>
Next we added a section to help users correct their performance.  On our
system main menu, we called this section "Is this right?" and added material
that helped users de-bug their folding frogs.  On the main menu for this
section, we displayed drawings from four different stages of the 11 step
jumping frog folding procedure.  We added textual instructions that asked
the user to first unfold the frog until it looked like one of the drawings,
then to click on the appropriate drawing.  
Figure 4 shows the "Is this right?" screen.  When the user clicked on a drawing,
we programmed Authorware to present the jumping frog tutorial at that step
in the paper-folding procedure.  This technique provided debugging support
to our users while re-using our previous work on the jumping frog tutorial.

<P>
To provide background reference material for the jumping frog paper-folding
task, we also developed an on-line origami library.  On our system main menu,
we called this section "Origami Library" and added textual information about
the history of origami, types of paper that are used, symbols for paper-folding
instructions, and ways to preserve origami creations.  
Figure 5 shows the "Origami Library" menu screen.
We supplemented the
textual information with illustrations from Corel Gallery and Microsoft
PowerPoint clip art.  We also added a background image from a World Wide
Web page on origami.  To change illustration colors and to add textual labels,
we imported the illustrations into Adobe Photoshop, made the changes, saved
the illustrations as pict files, and used our network to import the changed
illustrations into Authorware.  Figure 6 shows one of the Origami Library
History screens.

<P>
Our next development step was to port our completed EPSS from Authorware
for Macintosh to Authorware for Microsoft Windows.  This allowed us to run
our system on both Macintosh and IBM-compatible computers.  We ran into several
technical problems here.  For example, we had to change the Macintosh file
names to match the eight character prefix, three character suffix syntax
required by Windows.  We also had to put the sounds into QuickTime movie
files.
<P>
We thought it would be helpful if the user could operate the EPSS while folding
the paper.  That way, the user could match what the user saw on the video
with what the user was folding.  So, we used Verbex voice recognition software
to create a voice interface to our EPSS.  Since Verbex had trouble
differentiating some of our commands (for example, "What do I do?" and "How
do I do it?") we had to change some of our commands to phrases that were
more different (for example, "Give assignment" and "Provide steps"). 
<H2>Conclusions
</H2><P>
We estimate that it took 150 labor hours to build our demonstration multimedia
EPSS.  To develop the system, we needed to use a wide variety of skills that
included computer programming, graphics design, hardware maintenance, user
interface design, and writing.  We used 15 different software packages and
14 significant hardware items (see Table 1).  Along the way, we learned several
lessons.  They were: 
<BR>
<OL><LI>Use an interdisciplinary design team.  Our team included educational
technologists, a graphic designer, training experts, and a user interface
designer.  No one person had all the skills needed to build the high-quality,
easy-to-use EPSS that we wanted.  We usually assigned work to the person
who could do it best.  But we also found that each of us had to expand our
skills into new, unfamiliar areas.
<LI>Plan for development to take a lot longer than you expected.  We found
that it often took 10 times longer to accomplish a specific development step
than we expected.  Major time-consuming tasks included learning the
idiosyncrasies of various multimedia software packages, figuring out how
to correct authoring bugs, and recovering from occasional network crashes.
<LI>Iterate.  Iterate.  Iterate.  We found that it was very worthwhile to
frequently perform a series of short develop-test-fix steps.  This technique
allowed us to find errors when we were most familiar with what we had done
to create them, change design directions before we expended significant resources
on a design that did not work well, and keep our system working so that we
could continue development.  We also found that we got the most helpful feedback
when we asked non-team members to try our system.
<LI>Know when to stop, because you can always do more.  One of the benefits
of using multimedia is that it provides you with a tremendous amount of design
flexibility.  For example, you can present the same information using different
media or you can improve the quality of the media that you are already using.
 This flexibility is also one of the biggest challenges of multimedia
user-interface design.  We were constantly tempted to make our system even
better, but had to ruthlessly limit ourselves to changes that obviously helped
users perform their tasks.
</OL><P>
Our system showed customers and visitors what a multimedia EPSS was and how
it could help meet their human performance needs.  Users enjoyed the system
and seemed to think that we effectively utilized multimedia to improve learning.
 In addition, our team got valuable experience with the complex task of designing
and developing multimedia EPSSs.
<P>
We plan to perform objective and subjective evaluations of our demonstration
EPSSs.  The objective measurements may include the speed and accuracy with
which study participants learn to fold paper jumping frogs using the multimedia
EPSS versus the origami book.  The subjective measurements may include ratings
for how much the participants liked using the learning system, how effectively
they thought the learning system helped them to learn, and how likely they
would be to use the learning system in the future.  We will use the results
of this study to improve the proof-of-concept EPSS that we plan to build
for quality control inspectors in poultry plants.

<H2><CENTER>Introduction</CENTER></H2>
<P>
Ergonomics remains an important issue in industry today. Preventing and solving harmful ergonomic situations in the workplace can lead to greater productivity, profit, and employee moral. Currently, the School of Continuing Education at the Georgia Institute of Technology presents a week long course in ergonomics for industry personnel. This course covers basic ergonomic data, including anthropometric charts, data on human limitations, and the principles of workplace design; and how to conduct a survey of the workplace for harmful ergonomic activities. An important aspect of this course is learning to apply the basic ergonomic data while conducting a survey, that is, using the knowledge of human abilities and limitations to identify harmful ergonomic activities that are present while a worker is doing his or her job.
<P>
We have proposed, built, and evaluated a prototype interactive, multimedia instructional system, called ErgoTrainer. ErgoTrainer aids students, both students taking classes like the one taught at Georgia Tech and students learning on their own, in gaining basic ergonomic knowledge and learning the skill of job surveillance.
<P>
This paper discusses the ErgoTrainer prototype. The first section explains the reasons for using interactive multimedia. The next section provides a description of the ErgoTrainer prototype. The third section discusses the interactive portions of the ErgoTrainer prototype while the last section summarizes the results of the evaluation.<BR>

</H2><P>Learning takes place when students are motivated and enjoy what they are learning. This is often the hallmark of multimedia systems (Hsi & Agogino, 1994). We believe that learning is an active, constructivist process and that students construct their own new knowledge by interacting with rich learning environments (Honebein, Duffy, & Fishman, 1993; Papert, 1991; Piaget, 1954).
<P>
The rich environment of the ErgoTrainer prototype was designed to simulate a real work environment. It is thought that authenticity, that is, a match between the learning environment and the environment in which the skill is to be used, promotes transfer of learned knowledge to the appropriate situation (Royer, 1979). To achieve this rich environment, multimedia appeared appropriate (Kozma, 1991). The subject, ergonomics, is best portrayed in a graphic, and sometimes dynamic, manner. Text, graphics, and videos have been combined to present a realistic ergonomic work environment.
<P>
Aiding constructivist learning requires that the instructional system be interactive. Little has been written about what constitutes an interactive system. However, Borsook and Higginbotham-Wheat (1991) have suggested seven dimensions of interactivity which they claim are the "key ingredients of interactivity." These dimensions shed light on the aspects required for a system to be considered interactive. After an introduction to the ErgoTrainer prototype, the prototype will be discussed in terms of the seven dimensions.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Description of ErgoTrainer</CENTER></H2>
<P>
ErgoTrainer is instructional courseware designed to teach industry personnel about the tools and processes used to complete an ergonomic job analysis. In ErgoTrainer, the student analyzes a real industry job, displayed in a video--in this case, a worker cutting chicken nuggets--by completing a checklist identical to one that actual ergonomists use when evaluating workplaces. This checklist is also one recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for identifying hazards in the workplace. The student is lead through the checklist one item at a time.
<P>
In the course of completing the checklist, the student selects and uses job analysis tools, represented by buttons, which are located on the screen at all times. Ergonomic job analysis often requires that specific tools be used to collect information about potentially hazardous activities a worker may engage in and potentially hazardous environments a worker might encounter. The tools provide the student with the information that would be gained if the tools were used in the real workplace. For example, when the thermometer button is clicked, the system reports that the temperature is 50 degrees. The job analysis tools in ErgoTrainer consist of: a ruler, a weight scale, a stopwatch, a goniometer (a tool for measuring body angles), a light meter, and a thermometer. ErgoTrainer's introduction identifies each tool for the student at the start of the program. In addition to the tools, the full checklist with an explanation of how to fill it out is displayed during the introduction.
<P>
A Help screen, which briefly describes the tools and their functionality, is available to the student at all times. In addition, a Hint button is available to the student as well, which yields information specific to the content of the current checklist item.
<P>
After the introduction, the student encounters the main job analysis screen (see Figure 1), which features a piece of digitized video in the center of the screen. Independent Start and Stop buttons allow the student to proceed through the video clip at their own pace. The student uses the tool buttons to gather information for a particular checklist item, then checks a single number on the checklist. In addition to the tools there is a Job Description button. When pressed, the job description button gives the student information about the job which cannot be obtained from the tool buttons or the video, like the number of hours the job is done and how the worker is paid.<BR><BR>

<P>
The Feedback Area, located immediately below the tool buttons, provides the student with the tool information and the job description, and rates the student's response as correct or incorrect.
<P>
When the entire checklist has been finished, a full, completed checklist is shown on the screen to the student (see Figure 2). The completed checklist indicates the correct response to each checklist item, as well as the sum total. The total indicates the level of ergonomic hazard. If the total is greater than 10, the student is advised that a detailed job analysis should be conducted to identify the specific motions or environmental conditions which are ergonomically hazardous.<BR><BR>

<H2><CENTER>Interactivity and ErgoTrainer</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The ErgoTrainer prototype embodies all seven of Borsook and Higginbotham-Wheat's interactivity dimensions to some degree. The seven dimensions are immediacy of response, non-sequential access of information, adaptability, feedback, options, bi-directional communication, and grain-size. The dimensions and their relationship to ErgoTrainer are discussed below.
<P>
<I>Immediacy of response.</I> This dimension refers to the length of time it takes the computer to respond to the user; the more immediate the response the better. ErgoTrainer attempts to respond immediately to all user actions. Reaction time is a function of the machine that ErgoTrainer is running on as opposed to limitations in ErgoTrainer.
<P>
<I>Non-sequential access of information.</I> A system with this dimension allows the user to access the information it contains in an unspecified order. ErgoTrainer embodies this dimension to the limit of not controlling the actions that the user takes within a checklist item. Within a checklist item information can be accessed in any order the student desires. However, the checklist items must be done in order.
<P>
<I>Adaptability.</I> This dimension implies that a computer system can adapt to the user in some manner.  ErgoTrainer does a limited amount of adapting.  ErgoTrainer only adapts in the sense that it allows non-sequential access to the information it contains.
<P>
<I>Feedback.</I> This dimension refers to the system's ability to provide information about the situation. Feedback says more than "right" or "wrong"; it is also provides information on how to correct the situation. In ErgoTrainer the feedback provides the student with information which allows the student to determine what to do next. For example, when the student selects an incorrect checklist item rating, the feedback not only lets the student know that he or she is incorrect but also tells the student what he or she needs to do to figure out the correct rating.
<P>
<I>Options.</I> Interactive programs provide options for the user to choose from. Allowing the student to page through sequential information is not providing options. The user should have more than one course of action to take. In ErgoTrainer, the student has the option of pressing any button he or she wants. If an inappropriate button is pressed, then the student is given feedback on why it was not an appropriate button at this time.
<P>
<I>Bi-directional communication.</I> Information should flow from the user to the computer as well as from the computer to the user. In ErgoTrainer, the student's actions provide the user to computer communication while feedback provides the computer to user communication. The actions imply when the student is asking for help or does not understand the material, then ErgoTrainer provides the appropriate feedback, thus effecting bi-directional communication.
<P>
<I>Grain-size.</I> "Grain-size refers to the length of time required of a given sequence before allowing further input. (Borsook & Higginbotham-Wheat, 1991, p. 13)." For example, a 10-minute video which the students cannot control is not the appropriate grain-size for interactive systems. The grain-size within a checklist item in ErgoTrainer is quite small. The student receives immediate feedback and the student can always interrupt ErgoTrainer. Overall, though, ErgoTrainer requires that the student to complete all the checklist items in order to finish ErgoTrainer.
<P>
Overall, ErgoTrainer scores quite high in these interactivity dimensions.  The interactivity is what we hope makes the task authentic and interesting to students.  The next section discusses the evaluation and the results.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>ErgoTrainer Evaluation and Results</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The evaluation of ErgoTrainer consisted of three phases. The first phase consisted of connoisseur-based studies (Flagg, 1990) with the goal of determining if the design of the content and interface of ErgoTrainer `made sense' to experts in the two areas. The second phase was a pilot test with one student with the goal of determining if a potential user could actually use ErgoTrainer without aid from the developers. The third phase was a structured evaluation with fifteen students currently enrolled in an ergonomics course. The goal of the third phase was to determine how well the intended students could use ErgoTrainer to learn about ergonomic job analysis. The students had completed almost four days of ergonomic instruction, including job analysis, when we ran our evaluation. The focus of this evaluation was usability and motivation. Learning effects were not measured because it would be difficult to determine the learning effect of ErgoTrainer as opposed to the learning effect of the class, and the time limit did not allow for individual interviews which might have teased out the learning effect of ErgoTrainer. During the third phase, students completed surveys to collect demographic and opinion data.
<P>
To summarize the demographic results, we determined that our audience contained fewer engineers than we expected and that all of the students used computers at work, with most of the students owning home computers. In addition, ten of the fifteen students have previously used some kind of computer-based instruction software and most of them enjoyed the experience.
<P>
The opinion questionnaire concentrated on ErgoTrainer's ease of use and ability to motivate. All of the students enjoyed using ErgoTrainer and all but one thought it was easy to use.  They especially liked the incorporation of video. Almost all the students commented on the video as soon as it appeared on the screen. About a third of the students were confused at some point in the program and suggested clearer prompts and better tool icons.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Conclusion</CENTER></H2>
<P>
On the whole, the ErgoTrainer prototype was a success. It provided the students with the ability to complete an ergonomic job analysis with many the benefits of being in a real situation, without the consequences of making errors in the real job. The students enjoyed using it and would like to see other ergonomic topics covered in a similar manner. The students became very involved in the system and tried not to make any mistakes. This serious attitude seems to support the theory that the environment is authentic and interesting.
<P>
Interactivity and multimedia provided for a learning experience that is similar to the real job the students will have to do. In some senses, ErgoTrainer is a simulation of an ergonomic job analysis, it has this feel because of the multimedia and interactivity.
<P>
Even though ErgoTrainer is interactive, it could be made even more interactive. This could be accomplished in two ways: 1) Allow access to the checklist items in any order and allow the students to backtrack to previous checklist items, and 2) Keep track of the students actions in order to provide more detailed and appropriate feedback. Multimedia and interactivity can be important ingredients in creating authentic tasks which increase the likelihood of transfer from the learning environment to the job, and the ErgoTrainer prototype is a step in the direction of interactive multimedia training.<BR>

Abstract: Factory Automation Support Technology (FAST) is a new project for
Georgia Tech researchers.  FAST uses special hardware and performance support
software to improve the performance of users on work tasks by giving users
the right information, in the right quantity, at the right time.  The special
hardware is a wearable, voice-activated computer that allows users to operate
the system while keeping their hands free to perform their tasks.  The
performance support software will provide helpful, relevant, just-in-time
information that users need to perform their tasks.  So, FAST will improve
the user's performance by providing helpful information when and where the
user needs it.  This paper provides some background information about the
FAST system, discusses issues to be addressed by this research, and describes
our planned development of proof-of-concept systems in the poultry industry.
<H2>Introduction
</H2><P>
Today's workplace is continuously changing.  There is increasing automation,
down-sizing or right-sizing, and more mobile work forces.  The increasing
levels of automation require that employees know how to maintain and keep
the automation running.  More sophisticated automation often requires that
the work force be better educated.  When organizations down-size or right-size,
machines are often used to replace human labor, but fewer employees are available
to deal with the more sophisticated equipment.  More work has to be done
by fewer people.  Since automation is often scattered throughout a factory,
if not throughout the world, maintainers must travel to the automation to
do their work.  These mobile workers cannot be supported by current static
technologies such as desktop personal computers.
<P>
To meet these challenges we need to rethink both technological support and
training. This new workplace environment often requires more training which
means that training needs to become more efficient.  There are several drawbacks
to the way training is currently done.  These drawbacks are summarized below.
<BR>
<UL><LI>Training is costly and time-consuming [Gery 1991].  Training takes
employees off the job and sometimes requires employees to travel to a different
location.  
<LI>Training is not immediate [Zemke and Zemke 1995, Gery 1991, Carr 1992].
 Training is often forgotten by the time it is finally needed on the job.
 Also, since a lot of training is not performed in the context of the job,
it is difficult for employees to transfer what they are learning in training
to the actual job that they do at work [Royer 1979].
<LI>Training is geared towards increasing knowledge as opposed to increasing
productivity [Carr 1992].  Since the true business goal of training is to
improve the productivity of the work force, training is currently not directly
serving this goal.
<LI>Training is trainer-centered as opposed to learner-centered [Connor 1983].
 The trainer decides what the employee should know as opposed to the employee
asking for the information that the employee needs to get the job done.
<LI>Training is evaluated on learner satisfaction and attainment of classroom
goals instead of job performance [Carr 1992].  Good job performance is the
true goal of training.
</UL><P>
Performance support systems have been promoted as a solution to these training
drawbacks [Gery 1991, Stevens and Stevens 1995] [see Table 1].  The goal
of performance support systems is to provide employees with the right
information, in the right quantity and detail, at the right time [Gery 1991].
 This includes just-in-time training in the tasks the employee needs to do.
 In other words, performance support systems allow less proficient employees
to perform as more experienced employees.  Industry is interested in performance
support systems because they not only improve employee performance but also
reduce the time normally used for training.  Performance support systems
train employees as they are performing their jobs, rather than before they
perform their jobs.  This is a major shift in the way training is currently
conducted.

The goal of the FAST project is to combine the latest technology in wearable
computers with an educational performance support system.  The following
sections describe the FAST hardware and software in turn.  Later sections
discuss our research goals and plans for implementation.
<H2>FAST Wearable Computer
</H2><P>
The FAST hardware consists of a wearable, voice-activated computer system.
 This computer system was assembled in our lab and is equivalent to a 486
25Mhz desktop computer. This computer system consists of several components
[see Figure 1].  These components are described below.
<BR>
<UL><LI>A see-through display allows the user to work while looking at text,
drawings, and video that are pertinent to the user's job.
<LI>A miniature microphone/earphone provides audio information to the user
and accepts voice input from the user which keeps the user's hands free for
job-related tasks.
<LI>A wireless communications link sends and receives up-to-date information
to and from the plant computer system.
<LI>A wearable computer allows the user to enter and receive information
wherever the user goes.
<LI>A battery pack to supply power for all the components (battery not shown
in Figure 1).
</UL><P>
This computer system enables employees to get information at the task site
and, since their hands are not busy operating the computer, to continue to
perform a task as they are receiving the information.  This wearable computer
system complements software-based performance support systems by making them
accessible to employees at all times and in all places during their work
day.  
<P>
We have spent some time looking at the ergonomic issues involved in a wearable
computer.  For example, where should the computer be worn to keep it out
of the way but have it accessible in case the buttons need to be used?  We
hope that the convenience, comfort, and helpfulness of FAST will encourage
employees to want to use the system.

<BR>
<H2>FAST Educational Performance Support System
</H2><P>
The software component of the FAST system is an educational performance support
system.  Performance support systems usually consist of several types of
information. A typical performance support system provides a combination
of the following capabilities [Gery 1991, Reynolds and Araya 1995, Stevens
and Stevens 1995]:
<BR>
<UL><LI>Reference information about a job task or closely related set of
tasks
<LI>Just-in-time, task-specific training
<LI>Expert advice about a job task
<LI>Advice on how to use the performance support system effectively
<LI>Application help functions
<LI>Automated tools for task performance
</UL><P>
The three most common kinds of support information are:  reference information,
task-specific training, and expert advice.  Reference information describes
the task and other related tasks that the employee may need to perform. 
This reference information supports employees by making immediately available
information which they previously had to memorize or look for in a manual.
 For example, if a quality control inspector in a factory needs to check
that a machine reading is within tolerances, these tolerances can be supplied
by a performance support system.  As a result, the employee does not have
to remember the tolerances or to go back to her desk to compare the reading
to the specifications in a manual.  The reference section not only makes
employees more efficient but it also allows them to learn more deeply about
a given task.  The reference information is always available for the employee
to read and provides the theory behind the job tasks it supports.
<P>
Just-in-time, task-specific training reduces pre-job training by helping
employees to learn while doing their jobs.  For example, instead of looking
up information in a textbook that was used six months ago in a training class,
an employee can, for example, quickly access the on-line procedures for resetting
a piece of machinery that has gone out of tolerance limits.  This can be
done while the employee is standing in front of the piece of machinery.
 Just-in-time, task-specific training does not take the employee away from
the job, so it is not as time-consuming or expensive as traditional training.
 Since this type of training is done while employees are doing their jobs,
it is used immediately in the context of the job at hand.  Just-in-time,
task-specific training is also geared towards increasing productivity by
helping the employees do their jobs as opposed to teaching the employees
about their jobs.  Finally, this type of training is learner-centered because
employees ask for help when they need it to perform a task, and the help
gives them the specific information that they request.
<P>
Educational performance support systems often contain specific advice on
performing job tasks and using the performance support system to its greatest
advantage.  The advice is usually provided by an expert system.  Expert job
advice aids employees in reasoning about their tasks.  For example, an expert
job advisor may help an employee troubleshoot a piece of machinery to determine
why it is out of tolerance limits.  There can also be expert systems which
advise on the use of the performance support system as opposed to the actual
job task.  An expert performance support system advisor provides information
about the performance support system.  For instance, when the outcome of
a procedure does not match the expected one, the expert performance support
system advisor may suggest that the employee use the expert job advisor.
<P>
Two other types of information are application help functions and automated
tools for task performance.  These types of information are most helpful
when a supported task involves the use of a computer.  For example, application
help information can assist an employee with using an application necessary
to do his or her job  (e.g., a spreadsheet program).  Automated tools help
an employee perform a high-level task by doing lower-level tasks automatically.
 For example, an automated tool may aid a quality assurance employee by
calculating the average and total of quality data that is entered.
<H2>Additional Research Issue
</H2><P>
Besides the issues discussed above, an additional issue the FAST project
hopes to address is the question of how to support employees with computer
technology who do not normally work with computers to complete their tasks.
 Most performance support systems to date have been designed to aid workers
who currently have a computer in their work place and who use that computer
to perform their tasks (e.g., airline reservations agents, insurance providers).
 However, for tasks on which a computer is not currently used, there are
other issues to consider.  For example, what will be the effect of introducing
computers into the job?  Will computer literacy be a factor?  How do you
make the computer an integral part of the system?
<H2>Poultry Application
</H2><P>
We are currently implementing the FAST concept for two different poultry
industry applications.  The first application is a proof-of-concept performance
support system and wearable computer for quality control inspectors in poultry
processing plants.  The FAST hardware components will enable quality control
inspectors to directly input inspection data into a computer using voice
entry while their hands are busy manipulating poultry products.  The software
educational performance support system will tell an inspector how to do specific
inspections, how to compute measurement averages for the shift, what to do
if a measurement exceeds quality standards, and how to notify supervisors
if quality standards are not met.  The software performance support system
will also automatically integrate the quality information into daily reports.
 We are currently working closely with quality control personnel at a poultry
plant in Georgia to develop this proof-of-concept performance support system.
<P>
The second application is an initial educational performance support system
to aid plant personnel in conducting water reduction audits.  The system
will allow an employee to walk to various sites inside and outside the poultry
facility and perform specific tasks as defined by the performance support
system.  The performance support system will use text, audio, drawings, and
video to show the employee how to measure water flow, adjust water valves,
and calculate water usage.  We are working with environmental engineers at
Georgia Tech who currently perform this task at various sites across the
state of Georgia.
<H2>Summary
</H2><P>
By combining an educational performance support system and wearable computer
technology, Factory Automation Support Technology (FAST) addresses the learning
needs of workers while they perform their jobs. FAST addresses the drawbacks
of current training methods by providing learner-centered training when and
where it is needed.  FAST is not only addressing training issues but also
changes taking place in today's workplace.  These changes include increasing
automation, down-sizing, and more mobile work forces.  FAST has been implemented
as a demonstration system [<A HREF="edmedia1s.html">Najjar,
Ockerman, Thompson,
and Treanor (in press)]
</A>
and is currently being implemented in two poultry industry applications.

<H2>Training Challenges
</H2><P>
For training to be effective, it should be consistent with several challenging
guidelines.  These guidelines include:
<BR>
<UL><LI>Give training when the learner needs it
<LI>Give training where (physically) the learner needs it
<LI>Train the learner on only the information that the learner needs to do
their job
<LI>Allow the learner to control the training process
<LI>Use the medium (e.g., text, audio, drawings, video) that most effectively
communicates the information being learned
<LI>Emphasize performance rather than knowledge
<LI>Shorten the time between learning and application.
</UL><P>
Our project, Factory Automation Support Technology (FAST), meets these
challenging guidelines by combining two new technologies&aelig;a wearable
computer and an electronic performance support system.
<H2>Wearable Computer
</H2><P>
We are designing a customized wearable computer.  Figure 1 shows the computer's
major components.

<P>
These are the features of the wearable computer:
<BR>
<UL><LI>See-through display allows user to work while looking at text, drawings,

<LI>Wearable computer allows the user to enter and receive information wherever
the user goes
</UL><H2>Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS)
</H2><P>
The goal of performance support systems is to provide to employees the right
information, in the right quantity and detail, at the right time.  Performance
support systems allow less proficient employees to perform as more experienced
employees.  A typical performance support system provides a combination of
the following capabilities:
<BR>
<UL><LI>Reference information about a job task or closely related set of
tasks
<LI>Just-in-time, task-specific training
<LI>Expert advice about a job task
<LI>Advice on how to use the performance support system effectively
<LI>Application help functions
<LI>Automated tools for task performance
</UL><H2>Training Benefits
</H2><P> 
A wearable computer and an EPSS may improve the effectiveness of training
in certain situations.  In particular, these new technologies may be appropriate
when:
<BR>
<UL><LI>The user needs to learn how to perform specific tasks (as opposed
to facts or general concepts)
<LI>The user performs the tasks infrequently
<LI>The user must be mobile to perform the tasks
<LI>The user's hands must be available to perform the tasks
<LI>Multiple media (e.g., text, drawings, video, sound) are needed to communicate
the information to the user.
</UL><H2>Applications
</H2><P>
We used the FAST system to build one demonstration system and are working
on two industry applications.
<BR>
<UL><LI>Demonstration system shows how to make a jumping paper frog and provides
reference information about origami
<LI>One industrial application system trains environmental managers to perform
a water reduction audit
<LI>Second industrial application helps mobile Quality Assurance personnel
enter quality measurements while using their hands to take the measurements
</UL><H2>The Future
</H2><P>
We are already making plans to improve the wearable computer.  Our
second-generation computer will be faster, smaller, lighter, and use less
power than the current version.  We will also apply the lessons we learn
from building our EPSSs to making future systems even more effective.
<H2>Discussion Questions
</H2><P>
<UL><LI>How does this system change the way we design training?
<LI>How is training designed for this system different than other on-line
training systems?
<LI>What are some other applications of this technology?
<LI>What problems does this training technology present?
<LI>How can this training technology be made more effective?
<LI>In what environments will this training technology be helpful and in
what environments will it be a hindrance?

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Multimedia is being used increasingly to provide computer-based instruction. One reason for this trend may be the assumption that multimedia information helps people learn. To find out whether there is empirical support for this assumption, this paper reviews studies from a wide variety of fields to show that multimedia may be able to help people learn more information more quickly compared to traditional classroom lecture. Redundant multimedia does not always improve learning compared to "monomedia." Specific situations in which multimedia information may help people to learn include (a) when the media encourage dual coding of information, (b) when the media support one another, and (c) when the media are presented to learners with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned. There is empirical support for concluding that specific multimedia can be used to help people learn specific kinds of information.
<h2>Multimedia Information and Learning</h2>
<p>
Multimedia is the use of text, graphics, animation, pictures, video, and sound to present information. Since these media can now be integrated using a computer, there has been a virtual explosion of computer-based multimedia instructional applications. These applications run the gamut from serious computer-based tutorials for adults to the new category of "edutainment" products for children. These very diverse applications seem to share a common assumption--multimedia information helps people learn.
<p>
This assumption seems to be based more on personal opinion than on scientifically-based fact. People enjoy multimedia, prefer multimedia learning materials, and believe that multimedia helps them learn (e.g., Bosco, 1986; Bryant, Brown, Silberberg, & Elliot, 1980; Fletcher, 1989, 1990; Holliday, Brunner, & Donais, 1977; Rigney & Lutz, 1976; Samuels, Biesbrock, & Terry, 1974; Sewell & Moore, 1980). These beliefs are exploited by the marketers of multimedia hardware, software, and services to hype their products. One widely cited (e.g., "Eloquent Idea," 1992; Hofstetter, 1994; Staff, 1990) and completely unsupported assertion is that "People generally remember 10% of what they read, 20% of what they hear, 30% of what they see, [and] 50% of what they hear and see ..." (Treichler, 1967, p. 15).
<p>
So, people generally believe that multimedia helps them learn. But do empirical studies support this belief? This paper tries to cut through the hype and the enthusiasm to determine whether there is empirical support for the assumption that multimedia information presentation improves learning.
<h2>Classroom Lecture versus Multimedia Instruction</h2>
<p>
A good place to start is the classroom. The current, standard form of instruction is traditional classroom lecture. It seems reasonable to compare learning when the information is presented via classroom lecture to learning when the information is presented via computer-based multimedia.
<p>
Meta-analyses (Bosco, 1986; Fletcher, 1989, 1990; Khalili & Shashaani, 1994; Kulik, Bangert, & Williams, 1983; Kulik, Kulik, & Bangert-Drowns, 1985; Kulik, Kulik, & Cohen, 1980; Kulik, Kulik, & Schwalb, 1986; Schmidt, Weinstein, Niemic, & Walberg, 1985) examined over 200 studies that compared learning information that was presented in a traditional classroom lecture to learning the same information presented via
computer-based multimedia instruction. The students were in K-12, higher education, industry, and the military. The information that was learned included biology, chemistry, foreign languages, and electronic equipment operation. The control group usually
learned the information via classroom lecture or lecture combined with hands-on equipment experience. The comparison group usually learned the information via interactive videodisc
or some other kind of computer-based instruction. The researchers most often measured learning using tests of achievement or performance. Over this wide range of students and topics, the meta-analyses found that learning was higher when the information was presented via computer-based multimedia systems than traditional classroom lectures.
<p>
Another very significant finding was that learning appeared to take less time when multimedia instruction was used. For example, Kulik, Bangert, and Williams (1983) found one study that recorded an 88% savings in learning time with computerized instruction (90 minutes) versus classroom instruction (745 minutes) and another study that recorded a 39% savings in learning time (135 minutes for computerized instruction versus 220 minutes for classroom instruction). Both studies involved computer simulation instruction in physics. Kulik, Kulik, and Schwalb (1986) identified 13 studies in which students using computers mostly for tutoring learned in 71% less time than students in traditional classroom instruction. In a comparison involving eight studies, Kulik, Kulik, and Cohen (1980) found that computer-based instruction took about 2.25 hours per week while traditional classroom instruction took about 3.5 hours, a 36% savings in learning time. However, as impressive as these findings are, there may be other explanations for these results.
<h3>Instructional Method</h3>
<p>
For example, computer-based instruction may force the instructional designer to better organize and structure the learning material compared to traditional classroom lecture. This improved information organization may be responsible for the learning advantages associated with computer-based multimedia instruction.
<h3>Interactivity</h3>
<p>
Interactivity can be thought of as mutual action between the learner, the learning system, and the learning material (Fowler, 1980). Computer-based multimedia instruction tends to be more interactive than traditional classroom lectures.
<p>
Interactivity appears to have a strong positive effect on learning (Bosco, 1986; Fletcher, 1989, 1990; Verano, 1987). One researcher (Stafford, 1990) examined 96 learning studies and, using a statistical technique called effect size (difference between means of control and experimental group divided by standard deviation of the control group), concluded that interactivity was associated with learning achievement and retention of knowledge over time. Similar examinations of 75 learning studies (Bosco, 1986; Fletcher, 1989, 1990) found that people learn the material faster and have better attitudes toward learning the material when they learn in an interactive instructional environment.
<p>
So, the learning advantage of computer-based multimedia instruction over traditional classroom lecture may be due to the increased interactivity of multimedia instruction rather than the multimedia information itself.

<h3>Control of Learning Pace</h3>
<p>
Computer-based multimedia instruction allows the learner to personally set the pace of learning. Traditional classroom instruction does not. Self-paced learning is probably a more effective way to learn because the learner can move on to new material when the learner is ready. So, control of the learning pace is another possible explanation for the learning advantages associated with computer-based multimedia instruction.
<h3>Novelty</h3>
<p>
Information presented via multimedia may be more novel and stimulating than information presented via traditional classroom lecture. This explanation has some support from empirical studies. Analyses (Clark, 1983, 1985; Clark & Craig, 1992; Khalili & Shashaani, 1994; Kulik, Bangert, & Williams, 1983) of nearly 40 multimedia studies found that, compared to traditional classroom lecture, learning improvements were higher for groups that used multimedia for four weeks or less, but the learning advantage tailed off fairly strongly after eight weeks. The initial, higher learning advantages for multimedia may have been due to the novelty of the multimedia instruction. As students became more familiar with the multimedia, however, the novelty wore off, and the learning advantages decreased. It appears that the novelty of multimedia information has a slight, temporary, positive effect on learning.
<p>
So, computer-based multimedia information presentation appears to offer general learning advantages over the traditional classroom lecture presentation of information. Computer-based multimedia information seems to improve the level and rate of learning.  However, instructional method, interactivity, control of learning pace, and novelty are alternative explanations for these advantages.
<h2>Redundant Multimedia versus "Monomedia"</h2>
<p>
One way to try to eliminate the alternative explanations is to compare learning when the information, instructional method, interactivity, and pace are the same, and novelty is reduced. For example, this situation occurs when the same verbal information is presented using audio and printed text together (redundant multimedia) versus audio text alone ("monomedia"). Any performance differences found in these conditions are probably due to the media. 
<p>
Some studies (Levie & Lentz, 1982; Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992; Nugent, 1982; Pezdek, Lehrer, & Simon, 1984; Severin, 1967) looked at this kind of information presentation. These studies found that two redundant media seem to improve learning better than one medium. For example, Mayer and Anderson (1991) had college students (a) hear a verbal description simultaneously with an animation explaining how a bicycle pump works (redundant multimedia), (b) hear the verbal description only ("monomedia"), (c) see the animation only ("monomedia"), or (d) receive no training. On a problem-solving test, the students who heard a verbal description simultaneously with the animation (redundant multimedia) performed better than the other students. In another study (Nugent, 1982), the highest learning levels were obtained when elementary school students were presented information via combined text and pictures (redundant multimedia) or combined audio and pictures (redundant multimedia) compared to the same content presented via text alone ("monomedia"), audio alone ("monomedia"), or pictures alone ("monomedia").
<p>
However, redundant multimedia does not always lead to improved learning. For example, Severin (1967) found that children who learned animal names using two media (audio combined with print) did not show better animal name recognition than children who learned with one medium (print alone).
<p>
These inconsistent results may be due to the way in which the media are used. The next section identifies specific circumstances in which multimedia appears to improve learning. It seems that some situations more effectively improve multimedia learning than other situations.
<h2>Situations in which Multimedia Helps People Learn</h2>
<p>
There is empirical support for concluding that multimedia information provides learning advantages in several specific situations.
<h3>When the Media Support Dual Coding of Information</h3>
<p>
According to dual coding theory (Paivio, 1971, 1986, 1991; Clark & Paivio, 1991), information is processed through one of two generally independent channels. One channel processes verbal information such as text or audio. The other channel processes nonverbal images such as illustrations and sounds in the environment. Information can be processed through both channels. This occurs, for example, when a person sees a picture of a dog and also processes the word "dog." Information processed through both channels is called referential processing and has an additive effect on recall (Mayer & Anderson, 1991; Paivio, 1967, 1991; Paivio & Csapo, 1973). Learning is better when the information is referentially processed through two channels than when the information is processed through only one channel. Referential processing may produce this additive effect because the learner creates more cognitive paths that can be followed to retrieve the information.
<p>
Empirical multimedia studies support this idea. For example, in the Severin (1967) study mentioned earlier, animal name recognition accuracy was highest when children were presented the names via simultaneous audio and pictures (verbal and nonverbal channels). Children who received the same information via audio and print (two verbal channels) did not outperform students who received the information via print alone (verbal channel). Similarly, in the Nugent (1982) study, the highest learning levels were found when students were presented information via combined text and pictures (verbal and nonverbal channels) or combined audio and pictures (verbal and nonverbal channels) compared to the same content presented via text alone (verbal channel), audio alone (verbal channel), or pictures alone (nonverbal channel). 
<p>
In the Mayer and Anderson study (1991), the students who heard a verbal description simultaneously with the animation (verbal and nonverbal channels) performed better on a problem-solving test than the students who heard the description only (verbal channel), saw the animation only (nonverbal channel), or got no training. The same researchers (Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992) also performed a series of studies in which an auditory explanation of bicycle pump or automobile brake operation was presented before or during an explanation showing the same information. The mechanically-naive students who heard the explanation with the animation (combined verbal and nonverbal channels) performed better on a creative problem-solving test than the students who heard the verbal explanation before the animation (separate verbal and nonverbal channels).
<p>
However, there are cases in which presenting verbal and nonverbal media did not appear to lead to dual coding of the information, and, hence, improved learning. For example, in a classroom test, Samuels (1967) found that a related picture accompanying a simple short story interfered with the ability of poor first grade readers to learn to read the 50 words in the short story. In a laboratory study, Samuels (1967) presented words alone or words with identifying pictures to kindergarten children who were learning to read four words. After the children saw each word or word and picture, the experimenter read the word to the children. When the experimenter tested learning using only words, the children who saw only words performed better than the children who saw words with pictures. For this latter test, it appears that the pictures distracted the children. A review of related literature (Samuels, 1970) also concluded that pictures interfered with learning to read.
<p>
The studies described in this section support the idea that, except for learners who may be distracted by illustrations, learning may be improved when multimedia information encourages learners to referentially process the information in a dual coding fashion.
<h3>When the Media Support One Another</h3>
<p>
Multimedia information seems to improve learning when the media show closely related, supportive information. For example, Bransford and Johnson (1972) presented short, ambiguous text passages to high school students. Before seeing each passage, one group of students saw a picture that explained the ambiguous text. The researchers believed that this picture provided a context for understanding the ambiguous text. The students who saw the picture recalled more ideas from the text than the students who did not see the picture. It appears that the picture helped the students to interpret the meaning of the text.
<p>
In a review of the literature on text and illustrations, Levie and Lentz (1982) found that text that was accompanied by illustrations showing what was described in the text was learned better by children than text that was not accompanied by illustrations. For example, Peeck (1974) asked fourth grade children to read a story with supportive illustrations or without illustrations, measured learning via multiple choice, verbal recognition tests, and found that retention was better when the text was accompanied by supportive illustrations. Levie and Lentz estimated that children reading illustrated text learned one-third more than children reading non-illustrated text, especially when the illustrations supported information presented in the text. These results are consistent with the dual coding theory described above. Supportive illustrations may also make abstract relationships more concrete and simplify the complex (Winn, 1987, 1989).
<p>
Levie and Lentz (1982) also found that illustrations that did not show what was described in the text did not improve learning. For example, Sewell and Moore (1980) added to textual material small cartoons that did not support the textual information. Although the students enjoyed the cartoons, the cartoons did not affect learning. Evans and Denney (1978) found that the short phrases in picture-phrase combinations were recalled better as the pictures and phrases became more related. Using verbal captions, Bahrick and Gharrity (1976) showed that pictures helped people recall captions that were related to the pictures, but not captions that were unrelated.
<p>
Also, as Samuels' (1967) work with poor first grade readers suggested earlier, there appear to be some cases in which the addition of the nonverbal medium actually decreases learning. Poor first grade readers appeared to be distracted by the supporting illustrations that were added to the text. 
<p>
These results suggest that the mere presence of illustrations does not improve the learning of textual information. The illustrations must show information that is presented in the text and the learners must be able to avoid getting distracted by the nonverbal media. It appears that supportive illustrations help explain the textual material and allow learners to build connections between the verbal (text) and nonverbal (illustrations) information (Paivio, 1971, 1991; Clark & Paivio, 1991). This referentially processed, dual coded information leads to improved learning.
<h3>When Media are Presented to Learners with Low Prior Knowledge or Aptitude in the Domain Being Learned</h3>
<p>
Multimedia information appears to be more effective for learners with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned. Mayer (1993) believes that this is because the multimedia helps low domain knowledge learners to connect the new knowledge to prior knowledge or, for learning systems such as a bicycle pump, to build a cognitive model of the system. Multimedia may also make more important information more obvious. However, learners with high domain knowledge have a rich source of prior knowledge that can be connected to the new knowledge. These learners can make these connections or build cognitive models with text alone. Also, learners with high domain knowledge are more likely to know which information is important and on which information they should focus their attention.
<p>
In one study (Mayer & Gallini, 1990), college students read text with and without illustrations that explained the operation of automobile drum brakes. For college students with low prior knowledge of automobile drum brake operation, the illustrations improved their recall of explanative information and their ability to solve problems related to the explanations. For college students with high prior knowledge, the explanative illustrations did not affect their performance. Another study (Kunz, Drewniak, & Schott, 1989) found that for college students with low prior meteorology knowledge, use of pictures in text correlated positively with comprehension. But, for college students with high prior meteorology knowledge, use of pictures in text did not correlate with comprehension.
<p>
Studies by Blake (1977) and Wardle (1977, cited in Levie & Lentz, 1982) found that aptitude affected learning from multimedia. In the Blake (1977) study, college students with low or high aptitude in spatial and mental abilities learned the pattern of movement of five chess pieces via moving pictures (film), static pictures, or static pictures with arrows indicating motion. The students with low aptitude performed better in the conditions with moving pictures or static pictures with motion arrows than the condition with static pictures alone. However, the students with high aptitude performed similarly on all three kinds of pictures.
<p>
Wardle (1977, cited in Levie & Lentz, 1982) gave 800-word textual passages on various science topics to seventh grade students. Some of the passages included supporting illustrations. During a comprehension test, the students were allowed to look at the materials. Poor readers performed better when the passages included illustrations. For good readers, the illustrations had no effect.
<p>
The results of these studies suggest that multimedia is most effective for people with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned. This may be because experts already have a cognitive model and large amounts of information for new knowledge to connect to, but novices do not. Alternatively, novices may not know which information is important and on which information they should focus their attention.
<p>
So, empirical studies support the idea that multimedia may help people learn. Multimedia that encourages the information to be processed referentially, building dual coded verbal and pictorial cognitive representations, seems to improve learning. For example, relevant, supportive illustrations improved the learning of textual stories.  Multimedia also seems to be more effective for helping learners with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned.
<h2>Allocating Media for Presenting Information</h2>
<p>
Multimedia may also improve learning by allowing instructional designers to use the most effective medium to present specific information. Although media selection models based on learning objectives (e.g., Allen, 1974), data-to-medium rules (e.g., Arens, 1992; Arens, Miller, Shapiro, & Sondheimer, 1988), communication goals (e.g., Elhadad, Seligmann, Feiner, & McKeown, 1989; Feiner & McKeown, 1990, 1991a, 1991b) or learner characteristics, tasks, and instructional settings (e.g., Reiser & Gagne&acute;, 1982) are available, these models appear to be based on experienced judgment rather than on empirical studies. To improve the ability of instructional designers to make effective media allocation decisions, the following section summarizes the limited number of empirical studies that suggest how to allocate specific media for successfully presenting specific kinds of information to be learned. The results are shown in Table 1.

<h3>Assembly Instructions</h3>
<p>
To learn assembly instructions, it appears that text and pictures work well. Bieger and Glock (1986) found that people assembled with fewer errors when they received spatial information via text, but they performed the assembly task more quickly when they received spatial information via pictures. In another study (Stone & Glock, 1981), college students who used text with pictures made fewer errors on an assembly task than college students who used text alone. Apparently the best way to learn an assembly task is to acquire both spatial and verbal knowledge about the task steps. 
<p>
<h3>Procedural Information</h3>
<p>
To present procedures for operating a device, it appears that using a diagram and explanatory text helps people acquire a cognitive model of how the device works. Studies (e.g., Kieras, 1984; Kieras & Bovair, 1983, 1984) found that this device model allows people to infer procedures more quickly than people who learn about the device by using repetition without full comprehension.  Motion sometimes helps people learn procedures better than still pictures (e.g., Spangenberg, 1973).
<p>
Another study (Palmiter & Elkerton, 1991) found that text was better than animation for presenting procedural information. On an immediate test, people who saw animated demonstrations learned HyperCard authoring procedures faster and more accurately than people who saw only text. However, seven days later the people who saw only text were faster and as accurate as the people who saw animated demonstrations. Perhaps the textual procedures were learned better than the animated demonstrations due to differences in processing effort (e.g., Jacoby, Craik, & Begg, 1979; Salomon, 1984; Walker, Jones, & Mar, 1983). The text learners may have expended more effort to read and understand the information, resulting in improved long-term encoding of the information. But the people who watched the animated demonstrations may have passively observed the demonstrations without processing the information as well. The immediate test did not emphasize these differences in long-term encoding. However, the delayed test did. The results of the delayed test suggest that the animated procedures faded from memory much more than the textual procedures.
<h3>Problem-Solving Information</h3>
<p>
To learn problem-solving information, an animation with verbal narration was shown to be effective (Mayer & Anderson, 1991, 1992). People who saw an animation with verbal narration did better on a bicycle pump problem-solving test than people who got no training, saw the animation only, or heard the verbal description only.
<p>
To perform mathematical problem-solving, graphical presentations of information can improve performance compared to textual presentations (Moyer, Sowder, Threadgill-Sowder, & Moyer, 1984; Reed, 1985; Threadgill-Sowder & Sowder, 1982; Threadgill-Sowder, Sowder, Moyer, & Moyer, 1985). For example, one study (Threadgill-Sowder, Sowder, Moyer, & Moyer, 1985) found that grade school students who scored in the lowest quartile on a cognitive restructuring test (Hidden Figures Test) were able to improve their scores when the story problems in the test were presented using drawings that organized the problem data. Another study (Moyer, Sowder, Threadgill-Sowder, & Moyer, 1984) found that children in grades three to 11 solved mathematical word problems better with text and illustrations of the problem elements than text alone. The illustrations were more helpful to the low-ability readers than the readers with more ability. It appears the illustrations helped make the word problems more concrete, easier to understand, and, therefore, easier to solve.
<h3>Recognition Information</h3>
<p>
To communicate information that people need to recognize, pictures are extremely effective. In one study (Shepard, 1967), people looked at 600 pictures, sentences, or words. On an immediate test, recognition accuracy was 98% for pictures, 90% for sentences, and 88% for words. Another study (Nickerson, 1968) found that people had 63% recognition accuracy for a group of 200 black and white photographs one year after initial viewing. Other researchers (Standing, Conezio, & Haber, 1970) showed people 2,560 photographs for 10 seconds each. After three days, the study participants recorded recognition accuracy of over 90%. Read and Barnsley (1977) showed adults pictures and text from the elementary school books they used 20 to 30 years ago. Recognition accuracy rates for pictures and text were better than chance, with pictures alone being recognized more accurately than text alone. Finally, Stoneman & Brody (1983) found that children in visual or audiovisual conditions recognized more products in commercials than children in an auditory only condition. Pictures seem to allow very rich cognitive encoding that allows surprisingly high recognition rates, even years after the initial encoding took place.
<h3>Spatial Information</h3>
<p>
Illustrations are superior to text when learning spatial information. For example, Bartram (1980) arranged for college students to learn how to get from a starting point to a destination using a minimum number of buses. The researcher presented the bus route information via maps or lists and asked the students to provide as quickly as possible the correct list of bus numbers in the correct order. Bartram measured the time it took to correctly complete each bus route task. The study found that the students learned the bus route information more quickly when they used a map than when they used lists. Bartram believed that the students performed a spatial task, and the maps were superior to lists because the map presentation of information is consistent with people's preferred internal representation of spatial information.
<p>
In an exploratory study, Bell and Johnson (1992) allowed four people to select pictures or text for communicating instructions for loading a battery into a camera. Qualitative results showed a strong preference for pictures rather than text. The researchers believed that the information to be communicated was spatial, and that the results supported the hypothesis that spatial information should be presented pictorially.
<p>
A study by Garrison (1978) supported the idea that spatial relations are recalled and recognized better by children when the spatial relations are presented via story text and illustrations rather than story text alone. Also, a series of studies by Dwyer (1967, 1978) found that illustrated text was better than text alone when students were tested on spatial information using a drawing test.
<p>
Pictures appear to be an effective way to learn spatial information. This may be because spatial information tends to be encoded spatially (e.g., Kosslyn, 1973, 1975, 1976; Kosslyn, Ball, & Reiser, 1978) rather than verbally or by what it means (i.e., semantically). 
<h3>Small Amounts of Verbal Information</h3>
<p>
Sound appears to be an effective way to communicate a small amount of verbal information for a short period of time. For example, Murdock (1968) found that recognition for items in a nine item verbal list was better with an auditory presentation than with a visual presentation. Another study (Watkins & Watkins, 1980) found better short-term memory for a few verbal items when the items were presented via the auditory mode rather than the visual mode. A review of the related literature (Penney, 1975) concluded that, for tasks involving short-term memory, auditory presentation was better than visual presentation. This conclusion appears to be appropriate for about six verbal items. These results are consistent with Baddeley's (1983, 1988) concept of an articulatory loop for retaining verbal information in working memory and Conrad's (1964) finding that verbal information was coded via sound in short-term memory.
<h3>Story Details</h3>
<p>
For recalling story details, video with a soundtrack appears to be effective. Baggett (1979) found that, after a seven-day delay, college students who saw a dialogueless movie made fewer errors when recalling the story structure than college students who heard only equivalent text. On an immediate test of factual recall, children who saw a movie with an audio narration did better than children who heard a similar narration via radio (Barrow & Westley, 1959). Children recalled more story details when the story was presented via television with a narrated soundtrack than radio (soundtrack alone) (Beagles-Roos & Gat, 1983). Another study (Meringoff, 1980) found that children remembered more story actions when they saw a televised film with story narration than when they were read a very similar illustrated story. 
<p>
Static pictures also appear to help children learn auditory, oral prose. Levin and Lesgold (1978) reviewed a dozen studies that examined the effect of pictures on children's ability to learn auditory, oral, fictional, stories. The pictures reflected the contents of the stories and learning was measured by short answers to factual questions. The reviewers found that related pictures improved learning of the oral prose.
<p>
It appears that both dynamic and static pictures help people learn story details and prose. This may be due to the ability of pictures to serve as a rich cognitive node to which verbal information can be connected and subsequently retrieved.
<p>
There is empirical support for concluding that certain media combinations seem to be better than others for helping people to learn specific kinds of information. These combinations may encourage the information to be processed in a way that is easier to encode, store, retrieve, and use. 
<p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This examination of a wide variety of empirical studies shows that multimedia information helps people learn--sometimes. Computer-based multimedia instruction may help people to learn more information in less time than traditional classroom lectures. This is especially the case when the computer-based multimedia instruction is interactive and learner-paced. The learning advantage for redundant multimedia over "monomedia" is not consistent. But this inconsistency is resolved when one takes into consideration the specific circumstances in which the media are presented. In particular, there is empirical support for concluding that multimedia information is most effective when:
<ol>
<li>It encourages the dual coding of information.
<li>The media clearly support one another.
<li>The media are presented to learners with low prior knowledge or aptitude in the domain being learned.
</ol>
<p>
There is some empirical support for using specific multimedia to help people learn specific kinds of information. These advantages appear to be due to the ability of certain multimedia combinations to support the way people understand, organize, and access the information.
<h3>Unanswered Questions</h3>
<p>
Although this paper identified when and why multimedia seems to help people learn in several situations, some unanswered questions still remain. For example, is there an overall theory that we can apply to explain these empirical results and to predict future results? Since the media may affect how the learning material is encoded and retrieved, information encoding and retrieval theories (e.g., Anderson, 1976, 1983a, 1983b, 1993; Anderson & Reder, 1979; Mayer, Steinhoff, Bower, & Mars, 1995; Paivio, 1971, 1986, 1991; Reder, 1980) are possibilities. The effects of dual (verbal and pictorial) coding and elaboration are particularly promising (e.g., Najjar, 1995, 1996).
<p>
In many learning situations, we present information using multimedia, but test learning using pencil and paper. If we use a different technique to present information, should we use a different technique to test learning? Multimedia learning may be artificially low because the media we use in our tests do not match the media we use in our information presentation.
<p>
Also, there is informal support for concluding that using multimedia to support learning by building (e.g., Papert, 1991), collaborative learning (e.g., Scardamalia, Bereiter, McLean, Swallow, & Woodruff, 1989), and case-based teaching (e.g., Schank, 1991) help people to learn. Can we get strong, formal, empirical support for these promising multimedia-based learning techniques?
<p>
When used properly, multimedia can help people to learn.

<H2><CENTER>Abstract</CENTER></H2>
<P>
An interactive, multimedia instructional system prototype, called ErgoTrainer, has been proposed, built, and evaluated. ErgoTrainer is based on the constructivist perspective of instruction. It aids students in gaining ergonomic knowledge and learning the skill of ergonomic job analysis while performing a simulated job analysis on a real industry job. Through the use of case-studies and hands-on experience, a learning environment is constructed which promotes both exploratory constructivist based learning as well as guided exploration. The use of multimedia promotes authenticity and hopefully leads to transfer of the learned knowledge to the workplace. The results of initial evaluation of the prototype are positive.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Introduction</CENTER></H2>
<P>
Ergonomics remains an important issue in industry today. Preventing and solving harmful ergonomic situations in the workplace can lead to greater productivity, profit, and employee moral. Currently, the School of Continuing Education at the Georgia Institute of Technology presents a week long course in ergonomics for industry personnel. This course covers basic ergonomic data, including anthropometric charts, data on human limitations, and the principles of workplace design; and how to conduct a survey of the workplace for harmful ergonomic activities. An important aspect of this course is learning to apply the basic ergonomic data while conducting a survey, that is, using the knowledge of human abilities and limitations to identify harmful ergonomic activities that are present while a worker is doing his or her job.
<P>
This paper discusses the ErgoTrainer prototype. The first section discusses learning issues. The second section explains the reasons for using interactive multimedia. The next section provides a description of the ErgoTrainer prototype. The fourth section discusses the interactive portions of the ErgoTrainer prototype while the last section summarizes the results of the evaluation.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Learning Issues</CENTER></H2>
<P>
Several different concepts influenced the design of ErgoTrainer.  These concepts are drawn from our beliefs as to how students learn best.  We believe that learning is a constructivist process [1,2,3]. That is, the student must construct their own understanding of new knowledge.  We also believe that this construction happens best in a rich environment which supports learning-by-doing, in which students fail safely but ultimately succeed, and in which their process is supported.
<P>
In order to create this learning environment, we based the design of ErgoTrainer on Schank, Fano, and Jona's goal-based scenario (GBS)[4].  Schank et al. describe GBSs as "problems in the domain of the student's interest that present him with definable goals and encourage learning in service of achieving those goals." In ErgoTrainer, the goal is to perform an ergonomic job analysis and the students need to understand basic ergonomics knowledge to accomplish this goal. This provides an opportunity to tie basic ergonomic knowledge to the task for which it is useful. A goal-based scenario is structured around teaching students a skill.  Other learning (i.e., facts) takes place while the student pursues the goal of accomplishing the taught skill.  It is thought that information is more readily learned and remembered if the reason for learning the information is made explicit in a relevant task [5,4].  By connecting the presentation of the basic ergonomic information to the task of completing a job analysis, ErgoTrainer makes the importance of the basic ergonomic information obvious.
<P>
To provide the student with freedom to learn as he or she wants, ErgoTrainer has been developed to allow the student to fail.  That is, the student can perform the skill incorrectly.  At that point the student is notified that he or she has answered incorrectly and is allowed to try again with a hint pointing in the correct direction. Eventually, the student will be able to look up the necessary information in an attached reference section.  Hints, given when the student answers incorrectly or when the student asks for a hint, are provided as a form of scaffolding [6,7].  Scaffolding provides students with support which allows them to accomplish a task they would not be able to accomplish without support.  However, as the student becomes more proficient, scaffolding fades.  ErgoTrainer's scaffolding fades by allowing the students to choose the amount of scaffolding of which they take advantage.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Why Interactive Multimedia?</CENTER></H2>
<P>
Learning takes place when students are motivated and enjoy what they are learning. This is often the hallmark of multimedia systems [8].
<P>
The rich environment of the ErgoTrainer prototype was designed with multimedia to simulate a real work environment. It is thought that authenticity, that is, a match between the learning environment and the environment in which the skill is to be used, promotes transfer of learned knowledge to the appropriate situation [9]. To achieve this rich environment, multimedia appeared appropriate [10]. The subject, ergonomics, is best portrayed in a graphic, and sometimes dynamic, manner. Text, graphics, and videos have been combined to present a realistic ergonomic work environment.
<P>
Aiding constructivist learning requires that the instructional system be interactive. Little has been written about what constitutes an interactive system. However, Borsook and Higginbotham-Wheat [11] have suggested seven dimensions of interactivity which they claim are the "key ingredients of interactivity." These dimensions shed light on the aspects required for a system to be considered interactive. After an introduction to the ErgoTrainer prototype, the prototype will be discussed in terms of the seven dimensions.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Description of ErgoTrainer</CENTER></H2>
<P>
ErgoTrainer is instructional courseware designed to teach industry personnel about the tools and processes used to complete an ergonomic job analysis. In ErgoTrainer, the student analyzes a real industry job, displayed in a video--in this case, a worker cutting chicken nuggets--by completing a checklist identical to one that actual ergonomists use when evaluating workplaces. This checklist is also one recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for identifying hazards in the workplace. The student is lead through the checklist one item at a time.
<P>
In the course of completing the checklist, the student selects and uses job analysis tools, represented by buttons, which are located on the screen at all times. Ergonomic job analysis often requires that specific tools be used to collect information about potentially hazardous activities a worker may engage in and potentially hazardous environments a worker might encounter. The tools provide the student with the information that would be gained if the tools were used in the real workplace. For example, when the thermometer button is clicked, the system reports that the temperature is 50 degrees. The job analysis tools in ErgoTrainer consist of: a ruler, a weight scale, a stopwatch, a goniometer (a tool for measuring body angles), a light meter, and a thermometer. ErgoTrainer's introduction identifies each tool for the student at the start of the program. In addition to the tools, the full checklist with an explanation of how to fill it out is displayed during the introduction.
<P>
A Help screen, which briefly describes the tools and their functionality, is available to the student at all times. In addition, a Hint button is available to the student as well, which yields information specific to the content of the current checklist item.
<P>
After the introduction, the student encounters the main job analysis screen (see Figure 1), which features a piece of digitized video in the center of the screen. Independent Start and Stop buttons allow the student to proceed through the video clip at their own pace. The student uses the tool buttons to gather information for a particular checklist item, then checks a single number on the checklist. In addition to the tools there is a Job Description button. When pressed, the job description button gives the student information about the job which cannot be obtained from the tool buttons or the video, like the number of hours the job is done and how the worker is paid.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<B>Figure 1 - ErgoTrainer Job Analysis Screen</B></CENTER><BR> 

The Feedback Area, located immediately below the tool buttons, provides the student with the tool information and the job description, and rates the student's response as correct or incorrect.

When the entire checklist has been finished, a full, completed checklist is shown on the screen to the student (see Figure 2). The completed checklist indicates the correct response to each checklist item, as well as the sum total. The total indicates the level of ergonomic hazard. If the total is greater than 10, the student is advised that a detailed job analysis should be conducted to identify the specific motions or environmental conditions which are ergonomically hazardous.

<H2><CENTER>Interactivity and ErgoTrainer</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The ErgoTrainer prototype embodies all seven of Borsook and Higginbotham-Wheat's interactivity dimensions to some degree. The seven dimensions are immediacy of response, non-sequential access of information, adaptability, feedback, options, bi-directional communication, and grain-size. The dimensions and their relationship to ErgoTrainer are discussed below.
<P>
<I>Immediacy of response</I>. This dimension refers to the length of time it takes the computer to respond to the user; the more immediate the response the better. ErgoTrainer attempts to respond immediately to all user actions. Reaction time is a function of the machine that ErgoTrainer is running on as opposed to limitations in ErgoTrainer.
<P>
<I>Non-sequential access of information</I>. A system with this dimension allows the user to access the information it contains in an unspecified order. ErgoTrainer embodies this dimension to the limit of not controlling the actions that the user takes within a checklist item. Within a checklist item information can be accessed in any order the student desires. However, the checklist items must be done in order.
<P>
<I>Adaptability</I>. This dimension implies that a computer system can adapt to the user in some manner.  ErgoTrainer does a limited amount of adapting.  ErgoTrainer only adapts in the sense that it allows non-sequential access to the information it contains.
<P>
<I>Feedback</I>. This dimension refers to the system's ability to provide information about the situation. Feedback says more than "right" or "wrong"; it is also provides information on how to correct the situation. In ErgoTrainer the feedback provides the student with information which allows the student to determine what to do next. For example, when the student selects an incorrect checklist item rating, the feedback not only lets the student know that he or she is incorrect but also tells the student what he or she needs to do to figure out the correct rating.
<P>
<I>Options</I>. Interactive programs provide options for the user to choose from. Allowing the student to page through sequential information is not providing options. The user should have more than one course of action to take. In ErgoTrainer, the student has the option of pressing any button he or she wants. If an inappropriate button is pressed, then the student is given feedback on why it was not an appropriate button at this time.
<P>
<I>Bi-directional communication</I>. Information should flow from the user to the computer as well as from the computer to the user. In ErgoTrainer, the student's actions provide the user to computer communication while feedback provides the computer to user communication. The actions imply when the student is asking for help or does not understand the material, then ErgoTrainer provides the appropriate feedback, thus effecting bi-directional communication.
<P>
<I>Grain-size</I>. "Grain-size refers to the length of time re-quired of a given sequence before allowing further input. [11, p.13]." For example, a 10-minute video which the students cannot control is not the appropriate grain-size for interactive systems. The grain-size within a checklist item in ErgoTrainer is quite small. The student receives immediate feedback and the student can always interrupt ErgoTrainer. Overall, though, ErgoTrainer requires that the student to complete all the checklist items in order to finish ErgoTrainer.
<P>
Overall, ErgoTrainer scores quite high in these interactivity dimensions.  The interactivity is what we hope makes the task authentic and interesting to students.  The next section discusses the evaluation and the results.

<H2><CENTER>Evaluation and Results</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The evaluation of ErgoTrainer consisted of three phases. The first phase consisted of connoisseur-based studies [12] with the goal of determining if the design of the content and interface of ErgoTrainer `made sense' to experts in the two areas. The second phase was a pilot test with one student with the goal of determining if a potential user could actually use ErgoTrainer without aid from the developers. The third phase was a structured evaluation with fifteen students currently enrolled in an ergonomics course. The goal of the third phase was to determine how well the intended students could use ErgoTrainer to learn about ergonomic job analysis. The students had completed almost four days of ergonomic instruction, including job analysis, when we ran our evaluation. The focus of this evaluation was usability and motivation. Learning effects were not measured because it would be difficult to determine the learning effect of ErgoTrainer as opposed to the learning effect of the class, and the time limit did not allow for individual interviews which might have teased out the learning effect of ErgoTrainer. During the third phase, students completed surveys to collect demographic and opinion data.
<P>
To summarize the demographic results, we determined that our audience contained fewer engineers than we expected and that all of the students used computers at work, with most of the students owning home computers. In addition, ten of the fifteen students have previously used some kind of computer-based instruction software and most of them enjoyed the experience.
<P>
The opinion questionnaire concentrated on ErgoTrainer's ease of use and ability to motivate. All of the students enjoyed using ErgoTrainer and all but one thought it was easy to use.  They especially liked the incorporation of video. Almost all the students commented on the video as soon as it appeared on the screen. About a third of the students were confused at some point in the program and suggested clearer prompts and better tool icons.<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Conclusion</Center></H2>
<P>
On the whole, the ErgoTrainer prototype was a success. It provided the students with the ability to complete an ergonomic job analysis with many of the benefits of being in a real situation, without the consequences of making errors in the real job. The students enjoyed using it and would like to see other ergonomic topics covered in a similar manner. The students became very involved in the system and tried not to make any mistakes. This serious attitude seems to support the theory that the environment is authentic and interesting.
<P>
Even though we did not evaluate learning issues, we believe that the system can be improved by the use of more cases (i.e., different job videos) and by slowly providing the student with less support in using the tools. Currently, the students are told which tools will provide them with helpful information for each checklist item.  Future efforts will let the students determine this for themselves. ErgoTrainer requires some revisions and evaluation of the learning principles, but it proved to be a promising start.
<P>
Interactivity and multimedia provided for a learning experience that is similar to the real job the students will have to do. In some senses, ErgoTrainer is a simulation of an ergonomic job analysis, it has this feel because of the multimedia and interactivity.
<P>
ErgoTrainer is interactive, but it could be made even more interactive. This could be accomplished in two ways: 1) Allow access to the checklist items in any order and allow the students to backtrack to previous checklist items, and 2) Keep track of the students actions in order to provide more detailed and appropriate feedback. Multimedia and interactivity can be important ingredients in creating authentic tasks which increase the likelihood of transfer from the learning environment to the job, and the ErgoTrainer prototype is a step in the direction of interactive multimedia training.<BR>

Currently, the School of Continuing Education at the Georgia Institute of Technology presents a week long course in ergonomics for industry personnel. This course covers basic ergonomic topics, including anthropometric charts, data on human limitations, and the principles of workplace design, and how to conduct a survey of the workplace for harmful ergonomic activities.

<P>
We have proposed, built, and evaluated a prototype multimedia instructional system, called ErgoTrainer. ErgoTrainer aids students, both students taking classes like the one taught at Georgia Tech and students learning on their own, in gaining basic ergonomic knowledge and learning the skill of job surveillance. The evaluation was successful and the results were positive.

It is important to understand the underlying principles before designing a new system. To that extent this paper first explains the ideas behind the ErgoTrainer prototype.

Several different concepts influenced the design of ErgoTrainer. These concepts are drawn from our beliefs as to how students learn best. We believe that learning is a constructivist process [1,2,3]. That is, the student must construct their own understanding of new knowledge. We also believe that this construction happens best in a rich environment which supports learning-by-doing, in which students fail safely but ultimately succeed, and in which their process is scaffolded.
<P>
In order to create this learning environment, we based the design of ErgoTrainer on Schank, Fano, and Jona's goal-based scenario (GBS)[4]. Schank et al. describe GBSs as "problems in the domain of the student's interest that present him with definable goals and encourage learning in service of achieving those goals." In ErgoTrainer, the goal is to perform an ergonomic job analysis and the students need to understand basic ergonomics knowledge to accomplish this goal. This provides an opportunity to tie basic ergonomic knowledge to the task for which it is useful. A goal based scenario is structured around teaching students a skill. Other learning (i.e., facts) takes place while the student pursues the goal of accomplishing the taught skill. It is thought that information is more readily learned and remembered if the reason for learning the information is made explicit in a relevant task [5,4]. By connecting the presentation of the basic ergonomic information to the task of completing a job analysis, ErgoTrainer makes the importance of the basic ergonomic information obvious.
<P>
To provide the student with freedom to learn as he or she wants, ErgoTrainer has been developed to allow the student to fail. That is, the student can perform the skill incorrectly. At that point the student is notified that he or she has answered incorrectly and is allowed to try again with a hint pointing in the correct direction. Eventually, the student will be able to look up the necessary information in an attached reference section. Hints, given when the student answers incorrectly or when the student asks for a hint, are provided as a form of scaffolding [6,7]. Scaffolding provides students with support which allows them to accomplish a task they would not be able to accomplish without support. However, as the student becomes more proficient, scaffolding fades. ErgoTrainer's scaffolding fades by allowing the students to choose the amount of scaffolding of which they take advantage.
<P>
The rich environment was also designed to simulate a real work environment. It is thought that authenticity, that is, a match between the learning environment and the environment in which the skill is to be used, promotes transfer of learned knowledge to the appropriate situation [8]. To achieve this rich environment, a multimedia tool was designed. The subject, ergonomics, is best portrayed in a graphic, and sometimes dynamic, manner. Text, graphics, and videos have been combined to present a realistic ergonomic work environment. The ErgoTrainer prototype is described in the following section.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>ErgoTrainer Description</CENTER></H2>
<P>
ErgoTrainer is instructional courseware designed to teach about tools and processes used to complete an ergonomic job analysis. The user completes a job analysis to determine possible ergonomic hazards in the workplace. In ErgoTrainer, the student analyzes a real industry job, displayed in a video--in this case, a worker cutting chicken nuggets--by completing a checklist identical to one that actual ergonomists use when evaluating workplaces. This checklist is also one recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for identifying hazards in the workplace. The student is lead through the checklist one item at a time.
<P>
In the course of completing the checklist, the student selects and uses job analysis tools, represented by buttons, which are located on the screen at all times. Ergonomic job analysis often requires that specific tools be used to collect information about potentially hazardous activities a worker may engage in and potentially hazardous environments a worker might encounter. The tools provide the student with the information that would be gained if using the tools in the real workplace. For example, when the thermometer button is clicked, the system reports that the temperature is 50 degrees. The job analysis tools in ErgoTrainer consist of: a ruler, a weight scale, a stopwatch, a goniometer (a tool for measuring body angles), a light meter, and a thermometer. ErgoTrainer's introduction identifies each tool for the student at the start of the program. In addition to the tools, the full checklist with an explanation of how to fill it out is displayed during the introduction.
<P>
A Help screen, which briefly describes the tools and their functionality, is available to the student at all times. In addition, a `Hint' button is available to the student as well, which yields information specific to the content of the current checklist item.
<P>
After the introduction, the student encounters the main job analysis screen (see Figure 1), which features a piece of digitized video in the center of the screen that shows a worker cutting chicken nuggets. Independent `Start' and `Stop' buttons allow the student to proceed through the video clip at their own pace. The student uses the tool buttons to gather information for a particular checklist item, then checks a single number on the checklist. In addition to the tools there is a `Job Description' button. When pressed, the job description button gives the student information about the job which can not be obtained from the tool buttons or the video, like the number of hours the job is done and how the worker is paid.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<B>Figure 1 - ErgoTrainer Job Analysis Screen</B></CENTER><BR> 
<P>
The Feedback Area, located immediately below the tool buttons, provides the student with the tool information and the job description, and rates the student's response as correct or incorrect.
<P>
When the entire checklist has been finished, a full, completed checklist is shown on screen to the student (see Figure 2). The completed checklist indicates the correct response to each checklist item, as well as the sum total. The total indicates the level of ergonomic hazard. If the total is greater than 10, the student is advised that a detailed job analysis should be conducted to identify the specific motions or environmental conditions which are ergonomically hazardous.<BR><BR>

<H2><CENTER>ErgoTrainer Evaluation and Results</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The evaluation of ErgoTrainer consisted of three phases. The first phase consisted of connoisseur-based studies [9] with the goal of determining if the design of the content and interface of ErgoTrainer `made sense' to experts in the two areas. The second phase was a pilot test with one student with the goal of determining if a potential user could actually use ErgoTrainer without aid from the developers. The third phase was a structured evaluation with fifteen students currently enrolled in an ergonomics course. The goal of the third phase was to determine how well the intended students could use ErgoTrainer to learn about ergonomic job analysis. The students had almost four days of ergonomic instruction, including job analysis, when we ran our evaluation. The focus of the evaluation was usability and motivation. Learning effects were not measured because it would be difficult to determine the learning effect of ErgoTrainer as opposed to the learning effect of the class, and the time limit did not allow for individual interviews which might have teased out the learning effect of ErgoTrainer. During the third phase, students completed surveys to collect demographic and opinion data.
<P>
To summarize the demographic results, we determined that our audience contained fewer engineers than we expected and that all of the students used computers at work with most of the students also owning home computers. In addition, ten of the fifteen subjects have used some kind of computer-based instruction software and most of them enjoyed the experience.
<P>
The opinion questionnaire concentrated on ErgoTrainer's ease of use and enjoyableness of use. All of the students enjoyed using ErgoTrainer and all but one thought it was easy to use. They especially liked the incorporation of video. Almost all the students commented on the video as soon as it appeared on the screen. About a third of the students were confused at some point in the program and suggested clearer prompts and better tool icons.
<BR>

<H2><CENTER>Conclusion</Center></H2>
<P>
On the whole, the ErgoTrainer prototype was a success. It provided the students with the ability to complete an ergonomic job analysis with all the benefits of being in a real situation, without the consequences of making errors on the real job. The students enjoyed using it and would like to see other ergonomic topics covered in a similar manner. The students became very involved in the system and tried not to make any mistakes. Although we can not test attitude, this student attitude seems to support the theory that the environment is authentic and interesting.
<P>
Even though we did not evaluate learning issues, we believe that the system can be improved by the use of more cases (i.e., different job videos) and by slowly providing the student with less support in using the tools. Currently, the students are told which tools will provide them with helpful information for each checklist item. Future efforts will let the students determine this for themselves. ErgoTrainer requires some revisions and evaluation of the learning principles, but it proved to be a promising start.

<H2>Multimedia in Manufacturing Education Laboratory
</H2><P>
The <A 
HREF="http://www.gtri.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech Research
Institute</A> (GTRI) is a not-for-profit applied research organization that is part of the <A 
HREF="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of 
Technology</A>.  Most of our work is funded by state and federal government organizations.  The purpose of the <A 
HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/MiME">Multimedia in
Manufacturing Education Laboratory</A> is to develop innovative learning technologies and to conduct research on the use of these technologies in industrial and educational settings.
<H2>Research Problem
</H2><P>
We are investigating the use of wearable computers to help us with two applied research problems.  The first problem is the collection of real-time quality assurance data by mobile poultry plant workers in a very noisy environment.  The challenges on this project include:
<BR>
<ul>
<li>Providing hands-free operation
<li>Sharing the data in real-time with plant managers
<li>Supporting user comfort 
<li>Allowing audio interactions in a noisy environment
<li>Creating a simple user interface
<li>Keeping costs down.
</ul>
<p>
The second research problem is the performance of a poultry plant water reduction audit by a mobile facilities engineer who may not have conducted such an audit before.  The challenges on this project include:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Providing hands-free operation
<li>Integrating information, software tools, and procedures
<li>Organizing information in a way that is obvious to both novice and expert users
<li>Allowing the user to get support for a task as the user actually performs the task
<li>Allowing the user to learn and control what is learned and when it is learned
<li>Allowing users to enter data in a non-sequential, user-defined order
<li>Providing information using the most appropriate medium
<li>Customizing the procedures and feedback to reflect the steps already completed.
</ul>
<H2>Results
</H2><P>
We developed a customized wearable computer and two software applications.  The first-generation wearable computer consists of:
<br>
<ul>
<li>A compact computer (about the size of a portable cassette player) that the worker wears on a belt.  Combined with our customized applications and a wireless local area network, the computer allows the worker to enter and receive information wherever the worker goes.
<li>A microphone/earphone headset that allows the system to accept voice commands and to provide audio information while protecting the worker's hearing and keeping the worker's hands free for other tasks.
<li>A finger-operated pointing device that can be adjusted easily for right- or left-handed workers.  The cursor positioning and selection device serves as a backup for the voice input system.
<li>A head-mounted display with a tiny computer screen that does not block the worker's vision. The small display allows the worker to continue to work while looking at text, drawings, and videos.
<li>A wireless local area network that allows the worker to send data to and receive data from a central computer in the poultry plant.  The wireless LAN allows the plant manager to see the quality assurance data as it is collected.
</ul>
<br>
<p>
For the quality assurance data problem, we demonstrated the ability of a mobile worker to use voice to enter data using our first-generation wearable computer.  Next, we plan to store the data as a database file, use the wireless local area network to send the data to a computer in the Quality Assurance manager's office, then allow the manager to download it into a spreadsheet.
<p>
For the water reduction audit problem, we are developing a multimedia performance support system that integrates the steps, measurements, and reference material needed to perform a water reduction audit.  The system consists of reference information, just-in-time task-specific training, expert advice on how to complete the tasks, and  automated calculations.  We plan to demonstrate the system to the intended users this summer.
<p>
Also, we plan to continue to refine our wearable computer to make it lighter and more powerful.
<H2>Implications
</H2><P>
Our work has the following implications for wearable computing technology:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Wearable computers may allow mobile workers to collect and transmit real-time data
<li>Wearable computers may provide multimedia information to help mobile workers as they actually perform a task
<li>It may be possible to use voice input to operate wearable computers in noisy environments.
</ul>
<br>
<p>
In the future, wearable computers need to be smaller, lighter, more powerful, more robust, and cheaper.  Voice recognition systems also need to be more accurate.  Finally, after wearable computers and voice recognition systems satisfy these requirements, attention will shift to developing customized, easy-to-use applications that allow users to perform their tasks.

<H1><CENTER>Using a Wearable Computer for Mobile Training and Performance Support
</CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
<H2>Problem</H2>
<p>
For training to be effective, it should be consistent with several challenging guidelines. These guidelines include:
<ul>
<li>Give training when the learner needs it.
<li>Give training where (physically) the learner needs it.
<li>Train the learner on only the information that the learner needs.
<li>Allow the learner to control the training.
<li>Use the medium (e.g., text, audio, drawings, video) that most effectively communicates  the information being learned.
<li>Emphasize performance rather than knowledge.
<li>Shorten the time between learning and application.
</ul>
<H2>Solution</H2>
<p>This demonstration/poster will show how we met these challenging guidelines by combining two new technologies.
<H3>Wearable Computer</H3>
<p>
The first new technology is a custom-designed wearable computer.  Figure 1 shows a front view of our wearable computer.  The wearable computer uses an Intel 486 chip running at 75 MHz with 16 MB of RAM, a credit card-sized motherboard, and a 500 MB hard drive.  The computer includes an SVGA video controller, 16 bit sound, and a wireless network.  To power the computer, we developed easy-to-replace, rechargeable, nickel metal hydride battery packs.  We also developed a unique power management system that maximizes battery life and provides battery status to the user.  The computer currently runs the Windows 3.1 operating system.

<br>
<br>
<IMG ALIGN=middle border=1 hspace=5 SRC="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/EPSS/wear2front.gif">
<BR>
<p>
Figure 1.  Front view of wearable computer components.
<p>
The user enters and receives information from the computer using a combination microphone/earphone and a head-mounted, monochrome, 640 x 480 pixel, liquid crystal display. The user utilizes speaker-dependent voice recognition as the primary way to control the computer. The computer sits in a light, water-resistant, waist pack. Including all components, our wearable computer system weighs about 2.4 kg (5.3 pounds).
<p>
Our wearable computer provides many advantages for helping a user to perform tasks. For example, the
<ul>
<li>See-through display allows the user to work while looking at text, drawings, and video
<li>Earphone allows the user to hear explanatory audio narration while looking at information on the display
<li>Miniature microphone, voice recognition software, and our applications allow the user to control the computer via voice so the user's hands are free for other tasks
<li>Computer allows the information designer to use the best medium (e.g., text, graphics, video, sound) to communicate information to the user
<li>Batteries, computer, wireless network, and head-mounted display allow the user to be mobile, getting information when and where the user needs it
<li>Batteries and power management system allow the user to work between four and eight hours at a time without replacing the batteries.
</ul>
<H3>Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS)</H3>
<p>
The second new technology is a new concept in training called an EPSS.  Traditional training systems train the learner before the learner performs the task.  An EPSS trains the learner while the learner performs the task.  To do this, an EPSS uses specialized software that integrates information, tools, and methodologies to help a user perform a specific task.  An EPSS provides this relevant, just-in-time information when the user needs it and when the user asks for it.  This information can include:
<ul>
<li>Just-in-time, task-specific training
<li>Expert advice about a job task
<li>Reference information about a job task or closely related set of tasks
<li>Application help functions
<li>Automated tools for task performance.
</ul>
<p>
During ED-MEDIA 97, we will demonstrate our origami EPSS.  The EPSS teaches users how to fold a paper jumping frog.  We organized the training information in the origami EPSS into the following intuitive categories:
<ul>
<li>A brief description of the training goal
<li>The steps to follow to meet the goal
<li>A tool that helps the user correct his or her work
<li>An on-line library of background information.
</ul>
<p>
Figure 2 shows the main menu of our origami EPSS.

<p>
We will encourage attendees to put on our wearable computer and use the origami EPSS to fold a paper jumping frog.
<H2>Summary</H2>
<p>
Our wearable computer and EPSS give mobile users the training and task support they need, when they need it, where they need it, under the users' control.  Our system also eliminates the gap between learning and applying skills.

These new technologies are most effective when:
&Sigma;	The user needs to learn how to perform specific tasks (as opposed to facts or general concepts).
<ul>
<li>The user performs the tasks infrequently.
<li>The user must be mobile to perform the tasks.
<li>The user's hands must be available to perform the tasks.
<li>The user needs to send and receive information.
<li>Multiple media (e.g., text, drawings, video, sound) make it easier to communicate the information to the user. 
</ul>

<H2>Introduction
</H2><P>
Factory Automation Support Technology (FAST) is a new project for Georgia Tech researchers.  FAST is intended to:  1) train employees as they perform their jobs, rather than before they perform their jobs, and 2) meet the needs of today's mobile work force.  To meet these needs, FAST combines performance support software with wearable hardware.  We hope that this will decrease the amount of nonproductive training time while improving worker performance.
<H2>FAST Performance Support System
</H2><P>
The goal of a performance support system is to provide employees with the right information, in the right quantity and detail, at the right time.  Performance support systems allow less proficient employees to perform as more experienced employees by providing them with appropriate knowledge.  A typical performance support system provides a combination of one or more of the following capabilities:  reference information about a job task or closely related set of tasks; just-in-time, task-specific training; expert advice about a job task; advice on how to use the performance support system effectively; application help functions; and automated tools for task performance.
<H2>FAST Wearable Hardware
</H2><P>
To support mobile workers in factory environments, we are designing and developing special wearable hardware.  This hardware includes:  a small computer that can be worn on a belt which allows for portability and transmission of data in real-time to other computer systems, a visor which is worn like safety glasses to display computer information to the user via a miniaturized CRT, earphones for listening to auditory information provided by the computer, and a microphone to allow for voice-activated, hands-free operation of the computer.  This hardware enables workers to get information at the task site and, since their hands are not tied up operating the computer, to continue to perform the task as they are receiving the information. This equipment enhances the software-based performance support system by making it accessible to employees at all times.  We hope that the convenience, comfort, and helpfulness of FAST will encourage employees to want to use the system.
<H2>Summary
</H2><P>
This project addresses several research issues including:  how do you combine training and performance support for both novices and experts, how do you integrate a computer tool into a non-computer task, and does combining training and performance support increase the transfer of learning from training to work?  A FAST demonstration has been implemented and work on a real system for the poultry industry has begun.  The project is a partnership between the Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Georgia poultry industry.

<h4>
DEVELOPING A VIRTUAL STUDIO FOR LEARNING  HOW  DESIGN & MANUFACTURE
</h4>
<p>
Stakeholders Georgia Tech:  Janet Allen (ME), Jeff Heidler (MIME), Janet
Kolodner (EduTech), Kemper Lewis (SRL), Farrokh Mistree (SRL),David Rosen
(SRL), Chris Thompson (GTRI), and more as folk buy in!
</p>
<p>
Potential stakeholders Georgia Tech:  David Carlson (CoC), Wayne Daley
(GTRI), Kurt Gramoll (AE), Tom
Graver (CIMS), Mark Guzdial (CoC), Benjamin Jung (SRL/MIME),Janet Kolodner
(EduTech), Alan Larson (ME),Kristina McAlvin (SRL),Leon McGinnis (CIMS),

</p>
<p>
Potential stakeholders from Product Realization Consortium:  Sisson (WPI),
Williams (MIT), Taylor (Cornell), Wang (NCAT), and others.
</p>
<p>
Version:  August 22, 1995, Revised August 23, 1995.
</p>

<h4>GOALS</h4>
<p>
Our long-term goal is to create an " intelligent"  learning environment that
facilitates/supports learning  through doing.  Specifically, we are
interested in developing a VIRTUAL PRODUCT REALIZATION STUDIO ... one in
which students learn through doing.
</p>
Our short-term goals are:<br>
<ol>
<li>learn how we can make it easier for  students and faculty to use
exisiting computer resources in learning how design.
<li>learn how to use technology to create a personal learning resource,
<li>create the specs for an intelligent tutorial system for ME 3110
(Creative Decisions and Design) in
particular and lifelong learning in particular.
<li>learn how rich portable technology resources change the learning
processes of small groups.
<li>learn how instructors can integrate technology effectively into
collaborative design projects/classes.
<li>establish the infrastructure necessary to support the paperless
classroom and technology enabled curriculum.
<li>ensure that our work is compatible with that of the Product
Realization Consortium;  leverage as much as we can ...
</ol>
<p>
To get us started in achieving our long term goal we, in Fall 1995, we will
give loaded PowerBooks to students to use in  ME3110 and monitor what they
use and how they use  the resource.
</p>
<h4>HOW?</h4>
<ol>
<li>We will load 6  Apple Powerbooks with the following resources:
	<ul>       
	<li>Communication software:   fax capability,access to Web3110,
	EUDORA,
	file exchange capability for electronic submission of assignements and
	subsequent return to students.
	<li>Planning software: MacProject
	<li>Document preparation software:   Claris Works - word
	processor, spreadsheet, database, drawing, presentation
	<li>Symbol processing software:  Inspiration, Working Model,  ???
	<li>Design resource:   Course notes and other course realted
	material,  DSPT Workbook, Past reports, Gramoll material,  ???
	<li>Collaboration software:  CaMILE, ???.
	<li>HTML authoring/translaton software so that all project
	reports may be published on the WWW for peer review and future reference.
	</ul>
<li>We will offer a 1 unit ME4901 (Special Topics Course).  For these
folk, we will offer SPECIAL
tutorials and human support to facilitate student learning in this
"computer-intensive" environment.
</ol>

<h4>WIN-WIN</h4>
<p>
WIN for students:  We will make the PowerBooks into a "prize."  Students
will be encouraged to form groups who really & truly want to design using
computer technology.  As part of the BIDS in ME3110 we will ask students to
write a proposal.  The BID Memo will be changed.  Based on these
proposals we will decide on how to distribute the PowerBooks.  We will
offer support to overcome software related problems.
</p>
<p>
WIN for developers and faculty:  Student teams will attend extra tutorials,
complete surveys, keep a record of what they used and let us know how we
could have helped them better, etc.   Do extra stuff for 1 unit credit in
ME4901.
</p>

<h4>PROJECTS INVOLVING EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY FOR I995-96</h4>
<ol>
<li>Developing an Intelligent Learning Environment  (Design Learning
System).
<li>Developing a Multimedia Resource-Base.
<li>Combined enhanced WWW based educational resources/tools.
</ol>

<h4>POLICY</h4>
<p>
We want to set a good example to our students.  We do not want them to get
the message that using pirated software is OK.
</p>

<h4>MATERIAL ON WEB</h4>
<ul> Material for ME3110 on Web
<li><a href="http://srl.marc.gatech.edu">SRL home page</a>
<li><a href="http://srl.marc.gatech.edu/education/ME3110/me3110-Web.html">ME 3110 Page</a>
<li><a href="http://srl.marc.gatech.edu/education/ME3110/design-reports/dr-index-choices.html">ME 3110 Design Report Index</a>
</ul>
<p>
Additions for Fall 1995:  Course notes and workbook (text and images); DSPT
Workbook (computer); analysis tools (Multimedia from Kurt Gramoll).
</p>

<h4>LOGISTICS</h4>
<p>
Valery and Jeff attend ME3110 to see whats up and to mentor the teams using
Powerbooks.  Kemper gets involved with the DSPT Tools side of things.  Jeff
work with Kemper to get his "Attention Getting Tools" on line.  Jeff, Chris
and Janet A develop an outline for tutorials.

<A HREF="MMDM.html"><font size=4>Multimedia Design Model</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li><font size=3>The "Multimedia Design Model" is one version of literally scores of instructional systems design (ISD) models that have been designed for education and training.  The model includes four major functions: 1) analysis, 2) design, 3) production, and 4) evaluation.  Each function is divided into a set of specific activities.  A list of the project team members most likely to be involved in a function is also included as well as a list of the interim products likely to come out of that function.  One danger in applying this tool is that you might think you have to check off each activity in a linear manner.  Actual multimedia development projects will include some of these activities and not others.  Additional activities not included in this model may be required.  The team make-up and the specific interim products will also vary considerably according to the nature of a real-world project.  The model is only meant to suggest the types of activities to be followed.  It is a guide, not a blue-print.</font>
</ul>

<A HREF="NAM.html"><font size=4>Needs Assessment Matrix</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Needs Assessment Matrix" is a simple tool that suggests different ways of gathering information regarding audiences, tasks, and content while conducting a needs assessment for an interactive multimedia development project.  The easiest way of obtaining needs assessment information is to interview people, but interviews have limitations as well.  The ideal procedure is to "triangulate" the information you need by collecting it via two or more ways! 
</ul>

<A HREF="NADA.html"><font size=4>Needs Assessment Decision Aid</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Needs Assessment Decision Aid" is a tool designed to help you select the best method (or methods) for collecting information during the needs assessment portion of your analysis effort.  There are three primary information collection methods described in this tool: focus groups, interviews, and questionnaires.  Each has advantages and disadvantages.  The tool includes a list of questions that when you answer them should assist you in selecting the preferred method of collecting the needs assessment data you desire.  Of course, if personnel, temporal, and financial resources permit, it is sound policy to use two or three methods to collect needs data so as to "triangulate" your findings. 
</ul>

<A HREF="NFGP.html"><font size=4>Needs Focus Group Protocal</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Needs Focus Group Protocol" is a  tool that provides:<br> 
1. background information about focus groups as a method of collecting needs assessment data,<br>
2. an actual sample focus group protocol,<br>
3. references to additional information about this data collection method. 
</ul>

<A HREF="NIP.html"><font size=4>Needs Interview Protocal</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Needs Interview Protocol" is a tool that provides:<br> 
1. background information about interviews as a method of collecting needs assessment data,<br>
2. an actual sample interview protocol,<br>
3.  references to additional information about this data collection method.
</ul>

<A HREF="NQ.html"><font size=4>Needs Questionnaire</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Needs Questionnaire" is a tool that provides:<br> 
1. background information about questionnaires as a method of collecting needs assessment data,<br>
2. an actual sample questionnaire,<br>
3. references to additional information about this data collection method. 
</ul>

<A HREF="JCAT.html"><font size=4>Job / Content Analysis Tool</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>A useful approach to defining precisely what an multimedia program ought to contain is to conduct a job or content analysis.  If your program is intended to train people for a specific job, e.g., graphic artist. you will usually conduct a "job analysis."  If your program is aimed at educating people about a specific content or subject area, you will usually conduct a "content analysis."  Both types of analysis are quite similar, and in most cases, your analysis will include both job and content analysis.  If your multimedia program is focused on a clearly defined job, e.g., training a secretary how to use a new word-processing program, then the emphasis will be on "job analysis."  If however, the multimedia program is focused on general knowledge, e.g., the history of World War II, then the emphasis will be on "content analysis." 
</ul>

<A HREF="GAT.html"><font size=4>Goal Analysis Tool</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>An interactive multimedia program can address many different goals.  Before proceeding to the design stage, you will want to obtain agreement about a program's goals among the major parties involved in the development of a multimedia program.  These parties will include the clients, the users, the instructors, or anyone else with a major stake in the program.  The "Goal Analysis Tool," provides a strategy for gradually refining goals and describing the processes by which the attainment of goals can be assessed.  A through goal analysis will provide you with a sound basis for writing precise performance objectives.
</ul>

<A HREF="ART.html"><font size=4>Analysis Report Template</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Just as it is important to conduct a good needs assessment, it is also essential to report the findings in a clear, concise manner that decision-makers can understand and use.  The "Analysis Report Template" tool lists the major topics that should be included in a needs assessment or task analysis report.  The formality of the report will depend upon the size and scope of the project and the nature of your relationship with the client.  It is easy to get so caught up in the analysis phase of a project that there may not be enough time for the equally important design, production, and evaluation phases.  On the other hand, the clearer and more accurate your analysis, the more likely it is that your project will be focused on the real needs of the client and thereby be successful. 
</ul>

<A HREF="PER.html"><font size=4>Project Estimation Rules</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Project Estimation Rules" presented in this tool are based upon the "best guesses" of experienced instructional designers.  There is a lack of science in these estimates, but at least they give you a place to start in estimating the time and resources needed for an interactive multimedia development project.  Many important development aspects are not included in these "rules of thumb," e.g., authoring time and video or graphics production time.  
</ul>


<A HREF="PEW.html"><font size=4>Project Estimation Worksheet</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, you will want to use a spreadsheet program to establish an estimated budget for your multimedia development project.  This "Project Estimation Worksheet" will provide you with some guidance for setting up your own spreadsheet program to calculate the temporal, financial, and personnel resources required for a interactive multimedia design project.

<p>
<A HREF="AssumpC.html"><font size=4>Assumptions Checklist</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>During the "Analysis" phase of a development effort, you and your team gradually constructed a set of assumptions about the interactive product you are developing.  It is sound practice to confirm those assumptions before undertaking the bulk of the design work for the product.  The assumptions should be confirmed with your client and with any vendors that may be collaborating on the project.  The "Assumptions Checklist" is a tool that can help you confirm the assumptions underlying your multimedia development effort. 
</ul>

<A HREF="AC.html"><font size=4>Assessment Checklist</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Assessment Checklist" is designed to help you assure that each of the objectives you have defined for your interactive multimedia product is accompanied by one or more reliable and valid measures.  All too often development teams wait until a product is almost complete before "making up a test" intended to measure its outcomes.  That is generally too late.  By planning for assessment early in the design stage of your product, you will have a much greater chance of designing a program that is actually capable of achieving its objectives.
</ul>

<A HREF="AM.html"><font size=4>Assessment Matrix</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Assessment Matrix" is designed to help you assure that each of the goals or objectives you have defined for your interactive multimedia product is assessed by one or more reliable and valid outcome measures.  All too often development teams wait until a product is almost complete before "making up a test" intended to measure its outcomes.  That is generally too late.  By planning for assessment early in the design stage of your product, you will have a much greater chance of designing a program that is actually capable of achieving its objectives.  This tool will help you to consider alternative assessment procedures because traditional paper and pencil tests are often inadequate indicators of a program's outcomes.  Alternative performance assessment strategies such as "observations" and "portfolios" should be considered.
</ul>

<A HREF="UCC.html"><font size=4>User Characteristics Checklist</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>An important product of the analysis phase of a multimedia development project is a clear description of the salient characteristics of the users of the multimedia program.  In other words, you want to define your "target audience" accurately and in sufficient detail to make sound design decisions.  The checklist presented below includes four major categories of user characteristics: 1) cognitive, 2) personality, 3) social, and 4) physical.  Obviously, any given multimedia program can't be adaptable for every kind of individual difference, but multimedia can be designed to accommodate the user characteristics that are most critical in one or more specific contexts. 
</ul>

<A HREF="OST.html"><font size=4>Objectives Specification Tool</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>A key element in the instructional development process is to specify the objectives for your program as clearly as possible.  Vague or poorly stated objectives often result in instruction that is inappropriate or assessment that is invalid.  For example, consider the following objective: "Trainees will understand the importance of safety procedures on the job."  Such a vague objective provides little direction for how training should be designed or how the performance of this objective can be assessed.  This tool is designed to help you write more specific objectives by providing you with a list of observable verbs.    The tool includes verbs for both the cognitive (knowledge or intellectual processing) domain and affective (attitudes or values) domain. 
</ul>

<A HREF="ORC.html"><font size=4>Objectives Review Checklist</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The objectives for an interactive multimedia program should answer four essential questions about the performance or outcomes of your program: who is to accomplish the performance, what the performance is, the conditions under which the performance will occur, and the criterion or standards by which performance will be judged.  The "Objectives Review Checklist" is a tool that can help assure that your objectives are stated as clearly as possible.  Precise and unambiguous objectives provide useful direction for designing interactive multimedia as well as essential information upon which to base your assessments.  
</ul>

<A HREF="MMFS.html"><font size=4>Multimedia Feasibility Survey</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>In many projects, trainers or teachers will be expected to implement an interactive multimedia program at a local site such as a training center, school, or campus.  Obtaining input from these people as early as possible in the design phase of your project is essential.  You can obtain a great deal of useful information from instructors concerning the feasibility of implementing multimedia.  They can also provide many good ideas for the design of your program.  The information is the survey below could be obtained in a number of ways, e.g., face-to-face or telephone interviews, mailed questionnaires, or focus groups. 
</ul>

<A HREF="Gagne.html"><font size=4>Gagn&eacute;'s 9 Events Template</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Robert Gagn&eacute; is a major contributor to both behavioral and cognitive learning theory.  One of his most notable contributions is a model of instruction that includes nine critical events such as "Grabbing the Learner's Attention" at the beginning of a lesson.  Although the model seems quite simple, it has been shown to be an effective way to organize instruction across a wide variety of subjects.  It is one model of instruction that might be employed in an interactive multimedia program.  Of course, there are other models that may be more appropriate in your situation.
</ul>

<A HREF="EPT.html"><font size=4>Evaluation Plan Template</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>An essential component of evaluating an interactive multimedia program (or any other type of program) is preparing a sound evaluation plan.  The "Evaluation Plan Template" tool includes the major topics that should be included in a reliable and valid evaluation plan.  One unique aspect of this plan template is that it encourages you to consider decisions that must be made and should be affected by the evaluation data you collect.  The strategy seems simple, but is very challenging in actuality.  Working with your team, you need to anticipate as many possible decisions that may be made about the IMM program you are developing or implementing.  For each decision, try to identify questions that must be answered to help you make a better decision.  Then and only then should you decide on the evaluation design and data collection methods to be employed.
</ul>

<p>
<A HREF="DAL.html"><font size=4>Development Activity Log</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Development Activity Log" is one of the most important tools you will use in your work as a producer of interactive multimedia.  Essentially, the tool provides a way for you and your team members to keep records of the amount of time you spend working on a project and to assign that time to specific projects and activities.  It has many uses, e.g., it provides valuable information for any type of cost effectiveness evaluation that you or your clients might wish to conduct.  Of course, this information is also invaluable for basic accountability purposes.
<p>Using this tool involves two real challenges.  One is making sure that you and everyone else connected with the development effort logs time in an accurate manner.  The second is getting the time data tabulated and reported in a timely manner so that it can be used to make better decisions about project resources.  Project Managers need to monitor and motivate the logging of this data.
</ul>

<A HREF="PDO.html"><font size=4>Project Diary Outline</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Interactive multimedia design projects of any size or scope are usually very complex, and therefore demand the coordination of many different types of people working together.  Record-keeping is an essential task of the project manager.  It is a sound strategy to maintain a "Project Diary" throughout a multimedia design effort.  This tool provides an outline of the major components of a "Project Diary," and provides a rationale for the inclusion of the various sections.
</ul>

<A HREF="PSR.html"><font size=4>Project Status Report</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Project Status Report" is a very simple tool with a very important purpose.  Essentially, this tool is one of the primary inputs to your project diary.  The project manager should prepare project status reports at regular intervals, usually once a week, to keep your client and your team informed as to the progress (or lack thereof) with respect to the project.  It may also be useful to issue special project status reports whenever some important milestone has been accomplished, e.g., pressing a CD-ROM disk.  
</ul>

<A HREF="SOF.html"><font size=4>Sign-Off Form</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Sign-Off Form" is an exceptionally useful project management tool, especially when one is working for an external client.  Getting the client to sign-off on every interim product in the development of an interactive multimedia project will provide you with a solid basis for asking for additional resources (time, money, or people) that may be needed when the client wishes to change the program at some late date in the project.

<A HREF="TDG.html"><font size=4>Text Design Guidelines</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Text is an essential element of most interactive multimedia programs.  Text is so dominant in our world that it often over-looked in the design process.  Some programs appear as if the text has simply been "slapped on" the screen.  Text must be as carefully designed into interactive multimedia programs as any other elements (video, sound, graphics, etc.).  The "Text Design Guidelines" tool does not present hard and fast rules for text layout, but does illustrate practical recommendations that should be carefully considered.  
</ul>

<A HREF="PBS.html"><font size=4>Plan For Bidders' Session</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>When contracting out for services, it is financially wise to ask for bids from several different vendors to assure that you get the best value for your money.  A "Bidders' Session" is often held to provide potential vendors with the "Request for Proposal" (RFP) related to the services you require.  The "Bidders' Session" allows the vendors to seek clarifications concerning the RFP before they submit their bids.     
</ul>

<A HREF="RPT.html"><font size=4>Request For Proposal Template</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>A carefully crafted "Request for Proposal" (RFP) is the key to getting the best quality services you require for your project.  This tool provides you with guidance and a template for preparing a good RFP.
</ul>

<A HREF="PAR.html"><font size=4>Production Assistance Request</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Production Assistance Request" is a tool used to specify the types of production services you require from commercial vendors.  The more detail that you can add to such a request, the more likely you are to get the type and quality of production assistance you desire.
</ul>

<A HREF="EVC.html"><font size=4>Establishing Vendor Contracts</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>During the production stage, it is frequently a wise strategy to contract out for certain services such as video production or audio editing.  If you contract out for any services, you are advised to prepare a carefully written "contract" that will protect you, your client, and the vendor as well.  This tool provides you with guidance and a template for "Establishing Vendor Contracts."

<p>
<A HREF="EM.html"><font size=4>Evaluation Matrix</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Although by all appearances, the "Evaluation Matrix" is a very simple tool, it has a powerful purpose.  It helps you to consider a wider range of data collection methods than you might otherwise consider in relation to each of the questions addressed by your evaluation.  Evaluators sometimes get into the habit of using one or other data collection method, e.g., an end-of-training questionnaire, without considering the advantages of alternative methods.  This tool prompts you to consider each evaluation question and to decide which of the many data collection options have the greatest potential for providing the desired information.
</ul>

<A HREF="ARF.html"><font size=4>Anecdotal Record Form</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation data does not have to be reported as "cold hard statistics."  Often you will want to tell the "human story" involved in your development or implementation project.  One way of capturing those important stories and critical incidents that provide the human story is the "Anecdotal Record Form."  Participants in an interactive multimedia design project can use this instrument to describe a noteworthy event and to offer their own interpretation of its relevance.  It is very important to try to complete an Anecdotal Record Form as soon as possible after a critical event has occurred so as not to forget critical information.  It is equally important to separate your description of the incident from your interpretation of it!  
</ul>

<A HREF="ERC.html"><font size=4>Expert Review Checklist</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Expert review is one of the primary evaluation strategies used in both formative (How can this multimedia program be improved?) and summative (What is the effectiveness and worth of this multimedia program?) evaluation.  It is often a good idea to provide experts with some sort of instrument or guide to insure that they critique all of the important aspects of the IMM program that you want reviewed.  This "Expert Review Checklist" has been designed for use by an instructional design expert.  You would employ different sorts of Expert Review Checklists with different types of experts such as a content expert or a human computer interface expert. 
</ul>

<A HREF="FGP.html"><font size=4>Focus Group Protocol</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Focus groups are a powerful means of collecting data about learner or instructor reactions to a new interactive multimedia program.  However, focus groups need to be carefully planned so that you get the kind and quality of information you are seeking.  This "Focus Group Protocol" is a brief example of a list of questions that might be addressed during a focus group regarding an interactive multimedia program.
</ul>

<A HREF="FRL.html"><font size=4>Formative Review Log</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Formative Review Log" is a simple instrument that can be used by anyone you have asked to review your program in its formative stages.  The instrument has three columns, the first for recording the screen or format sheet number that the person is reviewing, the second for writing down observations (e.g., errors, confusing points, or ideas), and the third for recording what actions have been taken in reaction to the feedback provided by members of the project team.  Using an instrument like this with many different types of users will probably have the greatest pay-off for formative evaluation throughout the life of the project. 
</ul>

<A HREF="IL.html"><font size=4>Implementation Log</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>It is one thing to plan and develop a good interactive multimedia program.  It is entirely another thing to implement it as planned.  Many training innovations have failed because implementation factors (such as instructor motivation) were not considered.  It is essential to make every effort to collect information regarding the actual use of an interactive multimedia program as compared to the planned use.  The "Implementation Log" tool has been designed to make that comparison a little more systematic.  
</ul>

<A HREF="IP.html"><font size=4>Interview Protocol</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Interviews are a powerful means of collecting data about learner or instructor reactions to a new interactive multimedia program.  However, interviews need to be carefully planned so that you get the kind and quality of information you are seeking.  This "Interview Protocol" is a brief example of a list of questions that might be addressed during an interview regarding an interactive multimedia program. 
</ul>

<A HREF="Ques.html"><font size=4>Questionnaire</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Questionnaires are undoubtedly the single most frequently used type of evaluation instrument.  Poorly designed questionnaires are often administered at the close of a course or training session as a "smilometer" or "happiness indicator."  They are also often distributed to users of interactive multimedia programs.  If the only thing you find out about your interactive multimedia program with a questionnaire is whether the trainees liked it, you are not making good use of this strategy.  As shown in the "Questionnaire," a wealth of information can be provided by a well-designed instrument. 
</ul>

<A HREF="UIRF.html"><font size=4>User Interface Rating Form</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "User Interface" of an interactive instructional product, e.g, a multimedia program, is a critical element of the product that must be carefully evaluated.  If the user interface is not well-designed, learners will have little opportunity to learn from the program.  This rating form includes ten major criteria for assessing the user interface for an interactive program, such as "ease of use" and "screen design."  Not all of the criteria may be relevant to the particular program you are evaluating, but most of them will.  You may need to add additional criteria to the list.  Novice users of interactive instructional products are generally not good candidates for using this form.  The people rating the user interface should be experienced users of the type of program you are asking them to rate.  Even better, they could be experienced designers of interactive programs.   
</ul>

<A HREF="ERS.html"><font size=4>Evaluation Report Sample</font></A>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The "Evaluation Report Sample" presents one way of structuring an evaluation report.  Evaluation reports are notorious for being weighty volumes that few people read.  Not surprisingly, lengthy reports have little effect on decision-makers.  This tool illustrates a strategy for dividing an evaluation report into two-page sections that each include four parts:<p>

1) an attention-getting headline,<br>
2) a description of the major issues related to the headline,<br>
3) a presentation of data related to the issues, and<br>
4) a bottom-line recommendation or summary of the findings.<p>

People who receive a report in this format can take two or three sections at a time and make them agenda items for their team meetings.  In this way, the evaluation findings are much more likely to have an impact on practical decisions.  
</ul>

<LI>The "Analysis Report Template" tool will help you prepare a clear, readable, and concise presentation of the results of your analysis activities.    
<p>
<LI>Each of the components in the report should be addressed.
<p>
<li>It is a good idea to have the report reviewed by all internal team members before presenting it to your client.  
</ol>

<hr size=2>
<center><H2>Analysis Report Template</H2></center>

<B>Executive:</B>  This section presents an overview of the analysis findings in a format that allows decision makers to make important decisions effectively and efficiently.
<p>
<B>Introduction:</B>  This section introduces the major sections of the report as well as the primary people involved in conducting the analysis and producing the report.  The client is also clearly identified.  
<p>
<B>Background:</B>  This section describes any information which is needed to provide the reader with an understanding of the background for the analysis, e.g., who initiated it and why. 
<p>
<B>Purposes:</B>  This section describes the purpose(s) of the analysis.  For example, a needs assessment might be done to detect training or education needs that aren't being met by existing programs.  Or a needs assessment might be done to confirm the existence of needs or clarify the nature of needs that others have perceived.  A job or task analysis might be undertaken to collect information directly related to the nature of the interactive multimedia product under development.  
<p>
<B>Limitations:</B>  This section spells out any limitations to the interpretation and generalizability of the analysis.  It should also describe threats to the reliability and validity of the instruments (e.g., questionnaires, interview protocols, or focus group protocols) used in the analysis.
<p>
<B>Questions:</B>  A key element of an effective analysis is careful specification of the questions to be addressed by the analysis methods.  The clearer and more detailed these questions are, the more likely that you will be able to provide useful answers to them.  It is usually a good idea to collect needs assessment data in several ways from several sources, especially in projects that are quite costly.  
<p>
<B>Methods:</B>  This section describes the analysis techniques used such as observations and surveys.  Step-by-step descriptions of what was done should be provided.  
<p>
<B>Sample:</B>  This section describes the students, trainers, and other personnel included in the analysis.
<p>
<B>Instrumentation:</B>  This section describes all the instruments and tools that were used during the analysis.  Copies of the tools should be included in the Appendices.  
<p>
<B>Results:</B>  This section spells out the findings.  Graphs and charts should be used wherever they are appropriate.  
<p>
<B>Recommendations:</B>  This section presents recommendations based upon the findings report in the previous section.
<p>
<B>Summary:</B>  This section presents a brief "easy to digest" synopsis of the report.
<p>
<B>References:</B>  This last section lists the sources reviewed or consulted during the analysis.

<uL>
<LI>As a participant in an interactive multimedia design project, you will observe incidents or listen to reports of incidents which relate to the development and impact of the program.  It is important that this kind of anecdotal information be systematically recorded so that the story of the development and outcomes of this project can be understood.  Therefore, you should complete an Anecdotal Record Form whenever you witness or hear of a significant incident relating to the progress and accomplishments of project.  An anecdotal record is a verbal account which exhibits these characteristics:
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Each anecdote should be limited to a single incident.
<p>
<li>It should contain a factual, non-inferential description of the observed or reported incident.  (For example, "The trainees said 'I've never enjoyed using a computer before.' " instead of "The trainee expressed satisfaction with the training system.")
<p>
<li>It should include a description of the situation in which the incident occurs so that the meaning of the behavior can be understood.
<p>  
<li>It should be written as soon as possible after witnessing or hearing about the incident so that all important details can be included.
<p>
<li>It should include a separate section describing your interpretation of or feelings about the anecdote.  Your personal evaluation is important because 	your judgments about the project are valued highly.

DATE:    July 23, 1992
<p>
PLACE:    Beta Site 2      
<p>
NAME OF OBSERVER:        Lucy Schweitzer            
<p>
<B>Description of the incident:</B>  About two hours into the course, one of the trainees suddenly got up and left the class.  I followed him out into the hall and asked if anything was wrong.  He replied: "I can't waste my time sitting in the class because I don't intend to use the new system."  I asked him why and he answered:  "Computers don't work for me.  As soon as I touch one, the program blows up.  You'll be glad I won't use your system because it would just fall apart if I did.  It's nothing against you or your course, I just know it won't work."
<p>
I tried to talk to him more, but he indicated that he had to make some phone calls and left.
<p>
<B>Interpretation:</B>  The "(Insert name here.)" course training  is innovative and user-friendly in our eyes, but in the eyes of a person with high anxiety about technology, it is just another threatening computer program.  I suspect that this person strongly fears computers and that he has an unusually strong degree of "learned helplessness" with respect to them.  It may be worthwhile to conduct some sort of a pre-assessment with respect to "techno-phobia" and makes special efforts to help those who express high anxiety.  Also, this person indicated before the beginning of the course that he was only there because his boss insisted that he attend.  We may need to clarify the enrollment procedures for this and other clients.

<LI>The "Assessment Matrix" tool will help you consider the most appropriate and feasible assessment strategy for each of the goals or objectives of your interactive multimedia program.  (Assessment is different from evaluation in that assessment is focused on estimating student learning whereas evaluation is focused on the effectiveness and worth of programs or products.)  
<p>
<li>List your objectives on the vertical side of the matrix.
<p>
<li>List the feasible assessment methods on the horizontal side of the matrix.  
<p>
<li>Consider each objective carefully and choose the most appropriate assessment method.

<LI>The "Assumptions Checklist" will help you determine whether you and the client agree enough about the basic assumptions underlying the project to continue with it into the design phase of the project.

<li>You should feel free to modify or expand the checklist as needed in your specific situation.     
</ol>  
<p>
<hr size=2>
<center><H2>Assumptions Checklist</H2></center>

This tool presumes that time has passed between the initial estimate of project scope and the approval to begin the project.
<p>
<B>Step 1: Meet with the client (or talk by phone)  and determine:</B> 
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Are the goals and objectives still on target?  
<LI>Is the audience still the same?  
<LI>Is the content still the same?  (Review each proposed element.)
<LI>Are the plans for marketing the product (or implementing the program, or whatever) still the same?  What has changed?  
<LI>Has the amount of money, resources, and/or time available for the development effort changed? 
<LI>Does the client still support the development effort to the extent needed to provide necessary SMEs, documentation, and equipment?
<li>Are implementation plans still the same?  (personnel, dates, locations, etc.?)
</UL>
<p>
<B>Step 2: Review your estimates of project scope, including:</B>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Materials required
<LI>Time needed
<li>Project costs
</UL> 
<p>
If you have been newly assigned to manage the project, have inherited a vague project plan, and there are no detailed records of planned materials, time, or costs, then you should create them at this point.
<p>
<B>Step 3: If necessary, rethink the project goals:</B>
<p>
If serious questions about project scope or other assumptions arise, don't hesitate to raise a red flag.  It is better to rethink the multimedia development project now than to have to cancel it later, after wasting valuable time and resources.
<p>
<B>Step 4: If necessary, reestimate project scope.</B>
<p>
Based on the results of the preceding steps, you may have to create new estimates of project scope (deliverables, time, costs).   You'll need these to be accurate and up-to-date.   
<p>
The result of using this checklist should be with detailed, approved time line, budget, and project plan that justifies continued expenditures of time, money, and resources toward completing the multimedia design effort.

<uL>
<LI>A contract is an essential element in any business relationship.  Your contracts must be legally and financially sound.        
</ul>  
<p>
<hr size=2>
<center><H2>Establishing Vendor Contracts</H2></center>
<p>
After you have selected your vendor, you will need to complete some paperwork before the vendor becomes part of the project team.
<p>
Here's an overview of the process:
<p>
<B>
<OL>
<LI>Negotiate the contract terms and conditions with the vendor.
<LI>Prepare the contract and get it signed by legal office and the vendor.
<LI>Establish Purchase Order and invoicing processes.
<LI>Set up an e-mail account for the vendor, if appropriate.
<li>Obtain IDs for all vendor employees.
</OL>
</B>
<p>
Let's examine each of these in greater detail.
<p>
<B>1. Negotiate the contract terms and conditions with the vendor.</B>
<p>
Negotiating the vendor contract involves two substeps: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare for the negotiation.
<p>
A contract is a written document that spells out what you and your vendor have agreed upon regarding the services of the vendor and your responsibilities.  Typical subsections of a contract are:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Bidding
<LI>Costs and Equipment
<LI>Confidentiality Agreement
<LI>Access to Premises
<LI>Invoices
<LI>Communications
<LI>Reporting
<LI>Review and Acceptance of Work
<LI>Timeliness
<LI>Insurance Verification
<LI>Attendance at Meetings
<li>Back-Up
</UL>
<p>
Review these guidelines, then review the vendor proposal to see if there will be major discrepancies.  If so, prepare to present your company's position to the vendor.
<p>
<li> Conduct the negotiation.
<p>
Meet with the vendor,  review the issues, and obtain agreement.
</ul>
<p>
<B>2. Prepare the contract and get it signed by legal and the vendor.</B>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Obtain a sample contract from your Finance office.   
<LI>Review the sample contract and substitute the particular terms and conditions that fit your project as negotiated with the vendor.
<LI>Present the completed contract to the vendor for approval.
<li>Have the contract word-processed and proofed and then send it to your Legal department for approval.
</UL>
<p>
<B>3. Establish Purchase Order and invoicing processes.</B>
<p>
For details, see the Finance Dept. of your company.  
<p>
<B>4. Set up an e-mail account for the vendor, if appropriate.</B>
<p>
Contemporary ID projects demand rapid exchange of electronic documents.  E-mail is essential.  
<p>
<B>5. Obtain IDs for all vendor employees.</B>
<p>
If your company maintains security procedures, IDs will be required for the vendor employees.

<LI>The "Evaluation Matrix" tool will help you consider the most appropriate and feasible data collection method for each of the questions identified in your evaluation plan.  (Remember that evaluation is different from assessment in that evaluation is focused on the effectiveness and worth of programs or products whereas assessment is focused on estimating student learning.)  
<p>
<li>List your questions on the vertical side of the matrix.
<p>
<li>List the feasible data collection methods on the horizontal side of the matrix.  
<p>
<li>Consider each question carefully and choose the most appropriate data collection method.
<p>
<li>To make your own matrix, copy the matrix below and paste it into a new ClarisWorks file using the "Drawing" option in the "New Document" dialog box.

<LI>The "Evaluation Plan Template" tool will help you prepare a reliable and valid evaluation plan.  
<p>
<li>Each of the components in the plan should be addressed.
<p>
<li>It is a good idea to have the plan reviewed by all team members before attempting to implement it.

<center><H2>Evaluation Plan Template</H2></center>
<p>
<B>Introduction:</B>  This section introduces the major sections of the plan as well as the primary people involved in writing the plan.
<p>
<B>Background:</B>  This section describes any information which is needed to provide the reader with an understanding of the background of the interactive multimedia that is being evaluated. 
<p>
<B>Purposes:</B>  This section thoroughly describes the purposes of the evaluation.  A single plan can address a variety of purposes, but all must be delineated clearly.  Evaluation is always a political process and all parties must accept the purposes for the evaluation to be successful.
<p>
<B>Limitations:</B>  This section spells out any limitations to the interpretation and generalizability of the evaluation.  It should also describe potential threats to the reliability and validity of the evaluation design and instrumentation.
<p>
<B>Audiences:</B>  This section specifies all the primary and secondary audiences or consumers of the evaluation.  In general, it is recommended to open the evaluation up to as many people or agencies as the client will allow.
<p>
<B>Decisions:</B>  This section is probably the most difficult, but it should be included if the evaluation is to have meaningful impact on decision-making.  Trying to anticipate the decisions which can be influenced by an evaluation takes creativity and trust.  Many developers do not wish to anticipate negative outcomes for their efforts, but these too must be considered.
<p>
<B>Questions:</B>  A key element of a sound evaluation plan is careful specification of the questions to be addressed by the evaluation design and data collection methods.  The clearer and more detailed these questions are, the more likely that you will be able to provide reliable and valid answers to them.
<p>
<B>Methods:</B>  This section describes the evaluation designs and procedures.  There are scores of designs and hundreds of procedures which can be used.  The keys to success are matching these options to the purposes and questions of your client and keeping within the budget and time line of the study.
<p>
<B>Sample:</B>  This section specifies exactly which students, trainers, and other personnel will participate in the evaluation.  If necessary, a rationale for sample sizes should also be included.
<p>
<B>Instrumentation:</B>  This section describes all the evaluation instruments and tools to be used in the evaluation.  Actual instruments should be included in appendices for review and approval.  
<p>
<B>Logistics:</B>  This section spells out who will be responsible for the various implementation, analysis, and reporting aspects of the evaluation.
<p>
<B>Time Line:</B>  This section presents the schedule for implementation, analysis, and reporting of the evaluation.
<p>
<B>Budget:</B>  This section "costs out" the finances for the evaluation.

<oL>
<LI>Evaluators often write long reports of evaluations that few people bother to read.  Needless to say, these lengthy reports are unlikely to have much impact on decision-making if people don't even read them.  One way of increasing the likelihood that your evaluation report will be read and acted upon is to report it in easy-to-consume "chunks" of information.  
<p>
<LI>One strategy of "chunking" an evaluation report is to have no section of your evaluation report longer than two pages.  An illustration of this format is presented below.  The example is divided into four parts: 1) an attention-getting headline, 2) a description of the issues involved in that part of the evaluation, 3) evidence that relates to the issue(s), and 4) a bottom line recommendation based upon the evidence

<p>
<B>Although students value the self-paced nature of the L2 Algebra I multimedia program, it is not always implemented.</B>  
<p>
<ul>
<li><B>Issues</B>
<p>
Self-paced learning is an academic ideal held forth by many, but few curricula have implemented this principle on a large scale.  The L2 Algebra I course incorporates genuine self-paced learning, but it is not implemented in each school.  Hence, student satisfaction with the self-paced nature of the L2 Algebra I course varies considerably.  Overall, almost 50% of the 1,400 L2 students surveyed agreed with the statement that "The pace of this course is just right."   However, in those schools where teacher-paced guidelines have been most strictly enforced, as many as 90% disagree with the statement!  Overall student satisfaction with the L2 Algebra I course is much lower in those schools that have abandoned the principle of self-paced learning.  Reasons for instituting teacher-pacing may stem from factors outside the teachers' control (e.g., the inability to issue incomplete grades or no provisions for summer school) to differences in individual teacher styles (an inability to tolerate ambiguity or a need for more control).  Regardless of the source, teacher-pacing seems to be a major violation of the L2 program's design.  
<p>
<li><B>Evidence</B>
<p>
Example comments of students in schools where self-pacing is implemented include:  
<p>
Most of Gary's comments centered around how much he liked the self-paced nature of the instruction.  He told me this: "If you don't understand something, the computer will take you back, if you had a teacher and you didn't understand, you would just have to go on."
<p>
Sheri likes L2 primarily because she enjoys the self-paced instruction.  She also prefers working with a computer to listening to a teacher because she hates "teachers that sit there and talk to you for the whole period."
<p>
Aretha failed algebra last year in a traditional book-based, teacher-led class.  She appreciates the opportunity that L2 has given her to be independent.  "I'm on my own.  Here you go, teach yourself.  No excuses."  
<p>
.....he  [Don] likes it [L2] even more than he thought he would.  Primarily, he likes the self-paced method of instruction.  He told me "with a teacher, if you don't understand and the rest of the class does, they're going to go on without you."
<p>
He [Jeffrey] would recommend the class to his friends because of the self-paced, individualized nature of L2.  "You go at your own pace and the computer pertains to you better than a teacher," he said.
<p>
Charles really likes the self-paced learning in L2.  "I can't think of a better way to learn," he said.  He says that in a book class, the teacher goes too fast.   He says that with L2, "you work your butt off" but that in the book class "everyone is failing."  
<p>
Example comments of students in schools where teacher-pacing exists include: 
<p>
Her initial reaction to L2 was that it was "a lot better than text-based classes! It's self paced!" Her favorite aspect of L2 is that it shows you what to do step by step. She especially disliked the fact that after a short period of self paced use, the rules were changed so that L2 time deadlines were placed on students by the teacher. "We must be to chapter 8 by the fourth six weeks!" 
<p>
The worst thing about L2 is that now they have a teacher imposed pace that if not equaled will result in INCOMPLETES at the end of 6 week grading periods. He [Edward] has already missed one honor roll because of this policy and was peeved.
<p>
Farrah initially liked L2, "...it seemed easier than the teacher. It was self paced, and had individualized instructions. It was self paced!" She expressed definite resentment about the current policy of teacher set pacing.  When asked for her opinion of L2 now Farrah says, "I don't like it. Really - there are only so many days to complete X number of topics. If you don't finish them - you get an incomplete. I have some incompletes. A lot of people do. What are they (the administration) going to do at the end of the year?"
<p>
She [Angela] also expressed her feeling that they had been misled regarding the self paced concept. "Now we have to be at certain points at the end of each grading period. I had to come after school to keep up."
<p>
Matt initially was very excited about the L2 program. The self paced approach really appealed to him. By the time the L2 program was discontinued seven weeks ago his attitude toward the program had drastically changed. Matt's comments reflect this; "When we stopped L2 I disliked the program- a lot. I especially disagree with the time requirements and pass/fail grading policy. You should be given credit for increments in progress. If you haven't finished a chapter by the due date you get an `F' even if you were about 80% finished. This is not right!"
<p>
He [Paul] likes the self-paced aspects of the program, and he said he strongly resents the pressure that the teacher puts on him to make more progress.  He says that when he rushes through a section, he "really doesn't learn anything."
<p>
<li><B>Recommendation</B>
<p>
The National Science Center should work with school administrators, teachers, and parents to assure that the principle of self-paced learning can be implemented within the total educational environment of the local school system.  In those schools where this is not possible, the L2 Algebra I course may be reduced to a supplementary role or eliminated entirely.

<LI>The tool below is merely a template.  You should modify it as needed for your distinct purposes.  
<p>
<LI>Using an focus group is a type of survey activity.  Conducting a survey should be done systematically.  The overall steps in the survey process are:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Organize the survey team.
<LI>Determine the survey goal.
<LI>Select a representative sample.
<LI>Generate the questions.
<LI>Construct the instrument (questionnaire, interview protocol, or focus group protocol).
<LI>Test the instrument.
<LI>Administer the instrument.
<LI>Analyze the data.
<li>Share and use the results.
</UL>  
<p>
<LI>Consider collecting evaluation data with more than one method if time and resources allow.  For example, a questionnaire can be used to collect information about global reactions to an interactive multimedia program.  Then, either interviews or focus groups can be used to collect more detailed information.  Alternatively, interviews or focus groups might be used to identify the most important evaluation issues that will be included in a questionnaire sent to many people.

<A NAME="instruct"><center><h2>Instructions For Use</h2></center></A>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>The "Goal Analysis Tool" is based upon the work of Robert Mager.  For more direction in this area, please refer to the following books:
<p>
Mager, R. F. (1984). Goal analysis (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Lake.  
<p>
Mager, R. F. (1984). Preparing instructional objectives (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Pitman.   
<p>
<LI>The procedures included in this tool should not be applied in a lock step manner.  Instead, they simply provide a starting point for this extremely difficult and politically challenging task of getting people to agree upon a set of goals for a multimedia program.  Modify the steps as needed.  
</ol>  
<hr size=2>
<center><H2>Goal Analysis Tool</H2></center>

<B>Step 1 - Write down the goals.</B>  
<p>
Use what ever words are comfortable, regardless of how fuzzy or vague they be. This is the place for such words. You are just getting started and this step will help you remember where the analysis started in the first place.
<p>
It is politically useful to have the goals written down because you can get people (clients, instructors, workers, students, etc.) to reflect upon the goals and provide you with some indication of the degree to which they share them. Eventually you will want them to agree upon the specific performance objectives that represent the operational definitions of the goals. At this point, the major task is to get people talking about the goals.  
<p>
Make sure your statement describes an intended outcome rather than a process. Make your statement say "have a favorable attitude toward safety in the workplace" rather than "learn to have a favorable attitude toward safety in the workplace."
<p>
<B>Step 2 - Write down everything someone would have to say or do for you to agree that the someone has achieved the goal.</B>
<p>
Write down everything that comes to mind, and don't worry about being neat at this point. First get it down, then get it good. The reason you must complete this step without being judgmental is because it is difficult to search through the cloud of fuzzy ideas for the specifics you are looking for. Here are four strategies that you might try:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Answer the question, "What will ____ take as evidence that the goal has been achieved?"
<p>
<li>Answer the question, "Given a room full of people, what is the basis on which I would separate them into two piles - those who achieved my goal and those who have not?"
<p>
<li>If you were going to tell another person what to look for to determine that the goal had been achieved, what would you tell them to look for?
<p>
<li>Think of someone who has achieved the goal and write down everything they do.
</ol>
<p>
<B>Step 3 - Sort the items Listed in step 2.</B>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Cross out duplications and items that, on second thought, do not represent the meaning of the goal.
<p>
<li>Place check marks beside the items that do not qualify as performances; that is check for "fuzzies."
<p>
<li>Treat the "fuzzies" like new goals or subgoals and repeat step 2.  Iterate until all "fuzzies" have been clarified.
</ol>
<p>
<B>Step 4 - Write a complete sentence to describe each of the items on your final list.</B>
<p>
Each sentence should describe an outcome that must be achieved before you are willing to say that the goal has been achieved. These statements should say:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Who is to do some thing.
<li>What are they to do.
<li>Under what conditions they are expected to do it.  
<li>How well  are they expected to do it.
</ol>
<p>
<B>Step 5 - Test the sentences for completeness.</B>
<p>
	Test the collection of sentences to to see if you are finished with the analysis. Ask yourself the question, "If all these things occurred as described, would I be willing to say that the goal has been achieved?" If the answer is no, ask yourself the question, "What else would have to be achieved before I could agree the goal has been achieved?"

<LI>The "Job/Content Analysis" tool will help you collect and organize the information regarding the nature of a specific job or specific content or subject areas.  
<p>
<LI>Information for the "Job/Content Analysis" can be conducted in several ways, e.g., observations, interviews, or analysis of existing documents.  It is usually appropriate to collect information for an analysis in several ways.  Suppose you want to design a multimedia program that will show workers the proper procedures for taking care of a chemical spill in the workplace.  You might start by reviewing documentation provided by government agencies (such as the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration (OSHA)) or your client (such as Delta Airlines).  Then, you might interview the people in your client's organization who are responsible for safety concerning problems that have occurred in the past.  Later, you might take a tour of the workplace to observe the work practices regarding the handling, storage, and disposal of chemicals.  Finally, you might interview some workers to determine their present awareness of the safety procedures.
<p>
<li>Content analysis can be somewhat more difficult than job analysis because there is often no precise observations that can be made with respect to how knowledge is applied.  But suppose you want to develop a multimedia program about the History of World War II for secondary school students.  Such a historical event is very complex and even with the amazing storage capabilities of a CD-ROM, you cannot include everything known about World War II in your program.  How do you decide which content to include?  You might start by analyzing the content of some popular history books about the war.  After you have prepared a draft outline of the topics, you could ask several historians to review your outline for gaps or inaccuracies.  You would want to interview history teachers to find out what topics they consider most important about this war.   More importantly, you would want to work with teachers to develop assignments that can be used with this content.  How the information will be used is an important issue in deciding what to keep in the program.  Suppose the assignment is to analyze why the United States military command decided to use the atomic bomb on Japan, but did not use this weapon on Germany.  Obviously, you would want your program to include considerable material about the "Manhattan Project," time lines of the development of the bomb and the progress in the different theaters of the war, data about the attitudes of Americans toward their enemies in the conflict, and any other relevant archival material.
<p>
<li>A "Job/Content Analysis" is an important process within the overall multimedia development process.  However, it is difficult to know when you are done, especially with respect to "content analysis" for a large subject area.  A good rule of thumb is to continue the "Job/Content Analysis" until your job or content experts generally agree that you have specified the most important aspects of the job or content being analyzed.

<LI>The "Multimedia Feasibility Survey" indicates the types of questions that can be asked during an interview or focus group or on a questionnaire.  You should modify the questions to fit the context in which your program will be used.  
<p>
<li>A useful strategy is to collate and summarize the results of one round of the survey, and then to share the results with the same or a different group to have them modify or clarify your findings as needed.

<p>
This tool is designed to help you decide among three methods of gathering
additional information about the needs and audiences for the interactive
program you are developing.  The three options for collecting information
included in this tool are qeustionnaire, interview, and focus group.<p>

<center>[<A HREF="#nada">instructions for use</A>][<A HREF="#da">decision aid</A>][<A HREF="#question">questionnaire</A>][<A HREF="#interview">interview</A>][<A HREF="#focusgroup">focus group</A>][<A HREF="#info">more information</A>]</center>
<p>
<hr size=2>
<A NAME="nada"><center><H2>Instructions For Use</H2></center></A>

<p>
Once you are ready to use the decision aid, follow these steps:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Consider your options for gathering information about the needs and
audiences for your program, namely, questionnaires, interviews, or focus
groups.  It is assumed that you have considered their defining characteristics
and weighed their advantages and disadvantages.<p>
<li>Answer the questions presented in the decision aid before making a final
choice.<p>
<li>Consider collecting information with more than one method if time and
resources allow.  For example, a questionnaire can be used to collect some
baseline information about needs.  Then, either interviews or focus groups can
be used to collect more detailed information.  Alternatively, interviews or
focus groups can be used to define the issues involved in audience
characteristics, and a questionnaire can be used to confirm or refine the
issues.
</ol> 
<hr size=2>
<A NAME="da"><center><H2>Needs Assessment Decision Aid</H2></center></A>
<p>
Answer these questions to help yourself arrive at a decision regarding the type of instrument you will use to collect needs assessment data:<p>
<ol>
<li>Is anonymity of the respondent important?<p>
If YES, go to question 3.  <p>
If NO, go to question 2.<p>
<li>Is the ability to ask new, unanticipated questions important?<p>
If YES, go to question 4.<p>
If NO, go to question 3.  <p>
<li>Do you need the information right away (in less than two to four weeks)?<p>
If YES, go to question 7.  <p>
If NO, you should use a mailed questionnaire that can be returned anonymously
by the respondents.  <p>
<li>Is it difficult to meet with the respondents face to face?<p>
If YES, you should use a telephone or e-mail interview.  <p>
If NO, go to question 5.  <p>
<li>Can the respondents give you as much sixty minutes of their time?<p>
If YES, you should use a focus group.  <p>
If NO, go to question 6.<p>
<li>Can the respondents give you as much as thirty minutes of their time?<p>
If YES, you should use a person-to-person or telephone interview.  <p>
If NO, go to question 7.  <p>
<li>Can respondents be reached via e-mail or fax?<p>
If YES, you should distribute a questionnaire via e-mail or fax with
instructions on how the respondents can respond anonymously.  <p>
If NO, you should use a mailed questionnaire that can be returned anonymously
by the respondents.  You may have to use express mail services both ways to
speed up the process.  <p>
</OL>
<hr size=2>

<A NAME="question"><center><H2>Questionnaire</H2></center></A>

<p>
<UL>
<LI>is a paper document that presents a set of questions to which a person responds,
<LI>can be anonymous or the person responding can identify him or herself in some way,
<LI>can be mailed to the respondent directly or indirectly (some questionnaires are sent to specific people by name; others are sent to types of people such as nurses or teachers without identifying specific individuals), 
<LI>can have several different types of questions, e.g., multiple choice or open-ended, and
<LI>can vary in length, but should rarely take more than ten to fifteen minutes of a person's time.
</UL>

<h4>Questionnaire Advantages:</h4>

<OL type=a>
<LI>Questionnaires are especially useful when the respondents must remain anonymous.  They can be distributed and returned in ways that respondents can feel confident that their identities are secure.<p>
<LI>Questionnaires can be an efficient means of collecting information from the point of view of the respondents.  Questionnaires should be brief so that respondents spend no more than ten to fifteen minutes completing them.<p>
<LI>Different forms of questionnaires can be distributed to different audiences.  This strategy is particularly useful when you have a large pool of potential respondents and a lot of questions to ask about the audience. Through a process called "matrix sampling" you can ask some of the respondents to respond to one part of the questionnaire and other respondents to respond to another part of the questionnaire.<p>
<LI>There are many different types of questions that can be included in a questionnaire.  Some popular types of questions (or items) include:<p>

<OL>
<LI>open-ended, e.g.,<br>
What is the type of documentation to which you most frequently refer with an interactive program of this kind?<p>
<LI>multiple-choice, e.g.,<br>
Which is your least preferred source of information about a new program?<br>
__ On-line documentation       __ Paper Documentation      __ interactive multimedia<p>
<LI>ratings or rankings, e.g.,<br>Rank order the following sources from 1 (most effective) to 4 (least effective).<br>
__ On-line documentation       __ Paper Documentation
__ interactive multimedia __ Training Seminar<p>
<LI>Likert-scale, e.g.,<br>
My preferred sources for new product information is a hypermedia program that I can use on my own personal computer at home or in the office.<br>
__Strongly Agree      __Agree       __No Opinion      __Disagree      __Strongly Disagree
</OL>
</OL>
<p>
<H4>Questionnaire Disadvantages:</H4>
<OL type=a>
<LI>Questionnaires are relatively easy to design, but good questionnaires represent a significant investment in time and expertise to prepare.<p>

<LI>Questionnaires can take considerable time to distribute, process, analyze, and report.<p>

<LI>Questionnaires are not as flexible as interviews or focus groups.  The
latter permit the exploration of unanticipated issues whereas questionnaires
usually only provide information directly related to the specific questions
included in them.<p>

<LI>Many people are reluctant to respond to questionnaires and response rates
of forty percent or lower are not unusual.<p>

<H4>Interview Advantages:</H4>

<OL type=a>
<LI>Interviews are especially useful when there is a need to explore issues of
an undefined nature or considerable complexity.  This is because interviews can be modified "on the fly" to explore unanticipated issues.<p>
<li>Interviews can be used to gather information in a relatively brief period of time.  Interviews should not take more than thirty minutes per respondent. A skilled interviewer can collect useful data from a dozen respondents in a
day. <p>
<LI>Interviews can be modified from one respondent to another.   For example, if one respondent brings up an unanticipated issue, a new question can be added to the interview protocol that will allow the next respondent to confirm or disconfirm the issue.<p>
<li>Interviews can help you develop a personal empathy with the audiences for
your programs. <p>

<H4>Interview Disadvantages:</H4>

<OL type=a>
<LI>Interviews can be threatening, even intimidating for some respondents.  <p>
<LI>In a person-to-person interview, people may tend to provide the information they think you want instead of what they really feel.<p>
<LI>Depending on the nature of the similarities between the interviewer and the interviewee, the answers to questions can be negatively or positively biased.<p>
<li>Interviews can be difficult to schedule, especially person-to-person interviews.  Even telephone interviews can be difficult to set-up with busy people.<p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>When you are collecting needs assessment information for an interactive multimedia project, you may require information about the people who will use the program (called the audience), the work they do or will perform (called their tasks), and/or the information or products they deal with or produce (called the content).  There are three primary ways of finding out more about the audience, tasks, and content involved in a project:
<p>
<OL type=a>
<LI>Observations are sometimes considered the most direct method of collecting needs assessment data, although in many cases, a great deal of inference is involved in interpreting observations.
<p>
<LI>Interviews are considered the easiest way of collecting needs assessment data.  Questionnaires and focus groups may also be relatively effective and efficient methods.  However, what people tell you and what they really do may differ.  It is sometimes important to verify the results of interviews with observations and document analysis.
<p>
<li>Documentation review, e.g., looking at employee personnel records, can provide useful needs assessment data.  Of course, in some situations, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain desired documents.

<A NAME="over"><center><H2>Overview</H2></center></A>

The following protocol is designed to help you conduct a "focus group" interview with employees, students, managers, or any other group about their needs related to an interactive multimedia program you are developing.  Focus groups may be conducted at anytime during the Analysis Phase of a project.  For example, one or more focus group interviews may be conducted after you have collected some general data about needs with a questionnaire.  Focus groups allow you to explore information needs and preferences in more detail than can be obtained with a questionnaire, plus they have some advantages over one-on-one interviews.  Focus groups are sometimes used in lieu of one-on-one interviews because you can get more information from a group in a shorter period of time and check the reliability of the information at the same time.  
<p>
Focus group protocols consist of a set a primary questions and a set of secondary questions designed to get others in the focus group to either confirm or disagree with the first respondent's answers.  It is recommended that two people conduct a focus group interview with groups of six to eight people.  One of the interviewers will serve as the moderator, asking the questions and encouraging others to speak.  It is crucial that the moderator build an atmosphere of sharing among the group members so that one or two people don't dominate the discussion. 
<p>
The other interviewer is primarily charged with taking notes.  A challenging aspect of any type of interviewing is capturing what is said.  The best option is to have the interviews recorded and then have the interview transcribed later.  The second interviewer can use his/her notes to annotate the actual transcript.  Focus groups generally last from 30 minutes to two hours.  
<p>
<B>Some of the advantages of focus group interviews are:</B>
<UL>
<LI>they are highly efficient ways of collecting information; in one hour you can get the opinions of eight people;
<LI>they provide some quality controls and reliability checks on the information; participants tend to provide checks and balances for the views of others; and
<li>they tend to be fairly painless, even enjoyable ways for participants to provide important information during the instructional design process.
</UL>
<p>
<B>Some of the disadvantages of focus group interviews are:</B>
<UL>
<LI>only a limited number of questions can be covered, approximately ten per hour;
<LI>considerable group process skill is needed to conduct an effective, efficient focus group interview; and
<li>unexpected diversions can occur in a focus group such as power struggles among participants.

<A NAME="over"><center><H2>Overview</H2></center></A>

The following protocol is designed to help you interview employees, supervisors, managers, students, etc. about their needs related to a new job or task.  Often, interviews are conducted after you have collected some general data about needs with a questionnaire.  Interviews allow you to explore needs and preferences in more detail than can be obtained with a questionnaire.  Alternatively, interviews are sometimes used in lieu of questionnaires when time does not permit you to distribute questionnaires to a larger sample of people.
<p>
Interview protocols consist of a set a primary questions and a set of probing or secondary questions that are associated with each primary question.  You should ask the primary question first and give the interviewee sufficient time to respond before asking a probing question.  You should continue to ask probing questions until you are satisfied that the interviewee has given you as much information as you are likely to get related to the specific topic.  Then, you move on to the next primary question and repeat the process.  (There may also be a set of brief questions about the background of the interviewee.)  
<p>
One of the most challenging aspects of interviewing is capturing what an interviewee tells you.  Of course, you may wish to have interviews recorded and have the interview transcribed later.  However, some people are intimidated by recorded interviews and the logistics of recording can be difficult and awkward, especially for telephone interviews.  An alternative approach is to take notes during the interview and then to write out longer interpretations of the responses very soon after the interview is over.  On the other hand, taking notes during an interview is a skill that must be developed and practiced over time.  
<p>
Some authorities, e.g. Michael Quinn Patton (1987), insist that a tape recorder is an indispensable piece of equipment for interviewers.  Among the advantages of taping interviews are:<br>
<UL>
<LI>tape recorders do not "tune out" of the conversation,
<LI>tape recorders do not change what is said through interpretation,

Clarifying the nature and needs of the audience(s) for training or information systems is one of the most important activities during the Analysis phase of instructional systems design.  Especially when a new program is being developed, the audiences for the program must be carefully analyzed to assure that all their needs are met and all their preferred modes of learning or accessing information are considered.  A questionnaire is one of the three primary ways of collecting needs assessment information.  The other two ways are interview and focus group.  
<p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Questionnaires are especially useful when the respondents must remain anonymous.  They can be distributed and returned in ways that respondents can feel confident that their identities are secure.
<p>
<li>Questionnaires can be an efficient means of collecting information from the point of view of the respondents.  Questionnaires should be brief so that respondents spend no more than ten to fifteen minutes completing them.
<p>
<li>Different forms of questionnaires can be distributed to different audiences.  This strategy is particularly useful when you have a large pool of potential respondents and a lot of questions to ask about the audience.  Through a process called "matrix sampling" you can ask some of the respondents to respond to one part of the questionnaire and other respondents to respond to another part of the questionnaire.  
<p>
4.  There are many different types of questions that can be included in a questionnaire.  Some popular types of questions (or items) include:
<ol type=a>
<li>open-ended, e.g.,<br> 
What is the type of documentation to which you most frequently refer with an interactive program of this kind?

<li>multiple-choice, e.g.,<br>
Which is your least preferred source of information about a new program?<br>
__ On-line documentation       __ Paper Documentation      __ interactive multimedia  

<li>ratings or rankings, e.g.,<br>
Rank order the following sources from 1 (most effective) to 4 (least effective).<br>
__ On-line documentation       __ Paper Documentation      
__ interactive multimedia       __ Training Seminar

<li>Likert-scale, e.g.,<br>
My preferred sources for new product information is a hypermedia program that I can use on my own personal computer at home or in the office.<br>
__Strongly Agree      __Agree       __No Opinion      __Disagree      __ Strongly Disagree
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
<B>Some of the disadvantages of questionnaires are:</B>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Questionnaires are relatively easy to design, but good questionnaires represent a significant investment in time and expertise to prepare.
<p>
<li>Questionnaires can take considerable time to distribute, process, analyze, and report.  
<p>
<li>Questionnaires are not as flexible as interviews or focus groups.  The latter permit the exploration of unanticipated issues whereas questionnaires usually only provide information directly related to the specific questions included in them.  
<p>
<li>Many people are reluctant to respond to questionnaires and response rates of forty percent or lower are not unusual.

<LI>The "Objectives Review Checklist" is a useful tool for reviewing and refining the performance objectives for an interactive multimedia program.  This tool is based upon the work of Robert Heinich, Mike Molenda, and Jim Russell.  For more information, please consult their book:
<p>
	Heinich, R., Molenda, M., & Russell, J. D. (1989). Instructional media and the new technologies of instruction (3rd ed.). New York: Macmillan.  
<p>

<p>
<OL>
<LI>In many (if not most) multimedia development projects, you will want to specify the performance objectives for users of your program.  Having precise performance objectives will enable you to design better interactions into your program and to develop valid instruments for assessing the outcomes of the program.   
<p>
<li>Performance objectives can be written for three domains, the cognitive, the psychomotor, and the affective.  The cognitive domain refers to the intellectual processes involved in a job or content area.  These can range from simple recall of information to higher order problem solving.  The psychomotor domain refers to skills that require the use and coordination of the body in physical activity such as opening a container or moving a box.  The affective domain refers to attitudes, beliefs, values, and emotions such as enjoying or appreciating.  
<p>
<li>Writing performance objectives for the psychomotor domain is generally straightforward, e.g., "the trainee will put on safety goggles and gloves before opening a container of any chemical substance."  Writing performance objectives for the cognitive or affective domain can be much more difficult.  Therefore, a list of verbs that can help you write better objectives in these domains is provided below.
<p>
<li>Whenever you write objectives, review the verbs below to select the ones most appropriate to your job or content.  This is by no means a complete list of all the possible verbs and its primary value may be in spurring your imagination in writing better objectives.

<p>
<uL>
<LI>It is financially prudent to solicit bids on contracted work from a number of qualified vendors.  Otherwise, you may be paying too much or miss out on the "good deals" provided by start-up companies.        
</ul>  
<p>
<hr size=2>
<center><H2>Plan For Bidders' Session</H2></center>
<p>
A bidder's session is a meeting in which you present all potential vendors with your Request for Proposal (RFP).  The bidder's session can help you concentrate all your question and answer time into one efficient meeting.  In this way all the vendors get the same "party line" regarding the required training.
<p>
This tool will help you plan and conduct the bidder's session.   (This tool assumes you have completed your RFP.  See the tool, <A HREF="RPT.html">"Request for Proposal Template"</A>.)
<p>
Complete the following steps to plan and conduct the bidder's information session.
<p>

<B>Step 1:  Plan the bidder's session.</B>
<ol type=A>
<li>Contact several vendors by phone and then send a follow-up letter and explain, briefly, the time and place of the session.
<ul>
<li>Expect to spend no more than two hours.   In this time, you will present vendors with the RFP and answer questions.  
<li>Obtain a closed conference room for the meeting, with refreshments if desired.
<li>In the first letter and phone call, be careful to disclose no confidential information and do not give one vendor more information than another. 
</ul>
<p>
<li>Invite your supervisor or client to attend the meeting if you anticipate vendor questions which would require their response.
<p>
<li>Get together the following: 
<ul> 
<li>Copies of the RFP
<li>Any presentation materials which might be useful in explaining the subject of the training  (System flow diagrams, "exploded diagrams" of components, and other visuals can help vendors become familiar with the product or process quickly.) 
<li>Non-disclosure agreements for all vendors
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
<B>Step 2:  Assemble at least two vendors and conduct the bidder's information session.</B>
<p>
At the session, be sure to:
<p>
<oL type=A>
<LI>Make all vendors sign the non-disclosure agreement before discussing details of the product/process or the course. 
<p>
<LI>Provide each vendor with the RFP and point out the deadline for response.
<p>
<LI>Review the RFP, focusing on controversial or potentially difficult topics.
<p>
<LI>Highlight the "Constraints on budget, schedule, and design" section of parameters.
<p>
<LI>Explain and justify to vendors the development model you are using. Especially discuss how this process affects vendor deliverables, review and approval points, and vendor payment.
<p>
<LI>Answer vendor questions.
<p>
<li>Take care to provide all vendors with the same information.  This means that if a vendor comes up when the session is formally concluded, (as often happens) and asks you about a critical piece of information that you forgot to mention, you should make sure all vendors get this information before they begin work on their proposals.

<center><H2>Project Diary Outline</H2></center>
<p>
<ol type=A>
<li>Project Proposal - The funding for most interactive multimedia projects is obtained when companies compete via a Request for Proposals (RFP) process.  Suppose a corporation wants to have an interactive multimedia (IMM) information system developed for use by its employees to help them better understand the options they have for retirement plans, health benefits, etc.  The corporation could ask its own internal Human Resources Development (HRD) department to develop the interactive information system, but because the HRD department has never produced such a program before, the corporation decides to release an RFP in search of a contractor to develop a prototype IMM system.  Several multimedia development companies competed for the contract by writing proposals.  In the best of circumstances, the winning proposal is selected because it represents the best balance of quality, originality, and cost-effectiveness.  A copy of the proposal should definitely be part of any Project Diary.
<p>
<li>Usually, after winning a RFP competition, a formal contract is written that describes the "deliverables" for a project such as a CD-ROM with the prototype IMM system pressed on it, installation instructions, and maintenance guidelines.  The contract will also probably spell out the budget and time line for the project including any interim deliverables (e.g., a script), major milestones, payment schedule, and so forth.  Obviously, such a contract is an important part of a Project Diary.  
<p>
<li>In addition to any schedules or time lines included in the project contract, the project manager may also develop internal time lines or charts to help keep track of the schedule of the project and major accomplishments.  Project management software such as MacProject II or Harvard Project Manager can be very useful in this area.  These programs can be used to develop PERT charts that help plan, track, and manage the progress of a project.
<p>
<li>In addition to the budgetary information in the project contract, a manager will usually maintain spreadsheets that help plan, track, and manage the financial resources of a development project.  Spreadsheet program are available in integrated software packages such a ClarisWorks.  Or a special spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel may be used.  Copies of financial spreadsheets should be kept in the Project Diary.  
<p>
<li>It is rare that a project team will have every type of expertise and experience needed to construct an interactive multimedia project, and so often times it is necessary to contract others (called vendors) for special services such as video editing.  Also, even if you do have the internal expertise, it is sometimes less expensive to contract out certain aspects of a large scale development project.  Copies of vendor contracts for subcontracted work are important elements of a Project Diary.
<p>
<li>Project status reports should be issued at weekly intervals or on the occasion of the completion of some major milestone.  Copies of your status report should be maintained in the Project Diary.  
<p>
<li>Obtaining client sign-off on major milestones of a project is an important function of the manager.  Copies of sign-off forms should be kept in the Project Diary.
<p>
<li>It is a good practice to keep copies of any correspondence (e.g., letters or internal memos) related to the project in the Project Diary.
<p>
<li>An organizational chart or roster describing the team members assembled for the project and indicating their inter-relationships may be useful, especially in large scale projects in which personnel may not know the roles and responsibilities assigned to others.  Whatever kind of chart or roster is used, a copy should be in the Project Diary.
<p>
<li>Development activity logs should be maintained by all project team members and tabulated by the project evaluator or manager.  Time data will be invaluable in accounting for the resources used in completing this project.  It may be even more useful in planning for the next project.  Copies of this data should be included in the Project Diary.  
<p>
<li>Copies of receipts for expenses and invoices for services should be maintained in the Project Diary.
<p>
<li>Copies of any other documents related to the personnel, budget, or schedule of the project should be included in the Project Diary.
</ol>
<p>  
<B>NOTE:</B>  Although the above implies that a Project Diary should be kept in a three-ring binder, it is possible to keep everything in an electronic format provided sufficient back-up procedures are followed.

<A NAME="instruct"><center><h2>Instructions For Use</h2></center></A>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>The use of the word "rules" may be a bit strong for this tool.  However, when faced with the difficult task of estimating the size and scope of a project, it can be useful to consider some "rules of thumb" that other instructional designers use to estimate what might be involved in an instructional development project..    
<p>
<LI>"Rules of thumb" are provided for the following types of products:
<OL type=a>
<LI>Reading Materials
<LI>Audio and Video Scripts
<LI>Format Sheets for Interactive Training
<LI>Introductions and Summaries for Audio, Video or Interactive Segments
<LI>Instructor Orientation Materials
<LI>Lesson Plan Notes
<LI>Overhead Transparencies or Flip Chart Visuals
<LI>Exercises
<li>Quizzes

<center><H2>Project Estimation Rules of Thumb</H2></center>
<center><A HREF="#greer">(Adapted from Greer, 1992*)</A></center>
<p>
Here are some rules of thumb that some "old hands" in the training business use to estimate the amount of materials required for traditional and interactive training courses:
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li><B> Reading Materials:</B>
<p>
<B>Rule:</B>Up to 20 pages for each hour of trainee reading.  An experienced instructional designer will spend approximately one hour per page of finished reading material.  
<p>
<B>Explanation:</B>These include anything that trainees are asked to read, e.g., class handouts, text of workbooks, etc.  Exercises and quizzes are not included.
<p>
<li><B>Audio and Video Scripts:</B>
<p>
<B>Rule:</B>About 1 1/3 pages of script for each minute of audio, 2 pages of script for each minute of video.  Storyboards take more pages per minute.  A page of script for audio can be written by an experienced script writer in one hour, a page of video script in 90 minutes, and one storyboard takes an average of 30 minutes.  
<p>
<B>Explanation:</B>If your own designers are writing their own scripts, use these rules of thumb.  If you are subcontracting the script writing out to media producers, simply tell them how many minutes you will need.
<p>
<li><B>Format Sheets for Interactive Training:</B>
<p>
<B>Rule:</B>Ten or more format sheets may be required for each minute of interactive training material used by trainees.  Experienced designers can produce four format sheets per hour.  Storyboards for video or animation sequences may take more pages per minute at a rate of production of one storyboard per thirty minutes.  
<p>
<B>Explanation:</B>Formatting your intended interactions for CBT or interactive multimedia is essential for formative review and accurate communications with other members of a design team such as programmers and graphic artists.  
<p>
<li><B>Introductions and Summaries for Audio, Video or Interactive Segments:</B>
<p>
<B>Rule:</B>About a 1/2 page for each introduction or summary
<p>
<B>Explanation:</B>These "set-ups" or reviews may be required in trainee and/or instructor materials, especially when the segment is lengthy or the material complex.  Explanations of how to get started with interactive training materials are especially critical.  An experienced designer will write an introduction or summary in an hour.
<p>
<li><B>Instructor Orientation Materials:</B>
<p>
<B>Rule:</B>10 to 15 pages for a one day course
<p>
<B>Explanation:</B>This material describes the general instructor skills required, facilities and set-up requirements, overall expectations regarding the orchestration of events during the course, etc.  An experienced designer will write orientation material at the rate of one page per hour.
<p>
<li><B> Lesson Plan Notes:</B>
<p>
<B>Rule:</B>About 10 pages for every hour of lesson plans
<p>
<B>Explanation:</B>Lesson plans should include:
<UL>
<LI>clearly stated objectives
<LI>detailed lecture notes
<LI>ideas for getting and maintaining trainee attention/motivation
<LI>references
<li>recommendations for remedial or enrichment
</UL>
<p>
An experienced instructional designer will write lesson plans at the rate of one page per hour.
<p>
<li><B>Overhead Transparencies or Flip Chart Visuals:</B>
<p>
<B>Rule:</B>About ten per hour of instructor led presentation or demonstration
<p>
<B>Explanation:</B>This is a difficult one to estimate because some complex content may require substantially more visually.  It is a good idea to examine those used in similar courses before making a final estimate.  An experienced instructional designer can produce two overhead transparencies or flip chart visual per hour.  Often the instructional designer will sketch out the illustration and a graphic artist will produce the final product.  
<p>
<li><B>Exercises:</B>
<p>
<B>Rule:</B>Up to 5 pages of material for each trainee exercise
<p>
<B>Explanation:</B>Exercises include hands-on activities such as role-playing, in-basket exercises, assignments, and drill-and-practice materials.  Experience designers design exercises at the rate of one page per hour.
<p>
<li><B>Quizzes:</B>
<p>
<B>Rule:</B>One page for every two test items.
<p>
<B>Explanation:</B>A general rule of thumb is to have at least two test items for each objective provided that the objectives are behavioral based and defined very carefully.  Quizzes are much more difficult to prepare than most instructional designers realize.  Quizzes often requires the assistance of test, measurement, and/or evaluation specialists to assure that the quizzes are reliable and valid.  Allow at least 30 minutes of professional time for each test item.

<A NAME="instruct"><center><h2>Instructions For Use</h2></center></A>
<p>
<oL>
<LI>The Request for Proposal (RFP) is your "official" statement to vendors about the services you require.  Vendors typically try to respond, point by point, to your RFP when they make their proposals.  Therefore, the RFP "leads" vendors by focusing their attention on certain issues.  In addition, it shapes their first impressions of your training development group and the project to be completed.  Most importantly, the RFP is the foundation upon which the vendor's relationship with you is built.
<p>
<li>For these reasons, the RFP must be carefully crafted and reviewed before distributing it to vendors.        
</ol>  
<p>
<hr size=2>
<center><H2>Request for Proposal Template</H2></center>
<p>
The typical RFP includes the following sections:
<p>
<B>I.  The General Training Goals</B> 
<p>
This section includes the general business goals which are met by the new product or process on which the training will be based.  In addition, it describes the key components of the new product or process (how it works) and compares these to existing products or processes with which vendors may be familiar.
<p>
<B>II.  The Target Audiences</B>
<p>
This includes brief summaries of the jobs of the people who are to be trained.  Both primary and secondary audiences, if any, should be described.  Include information on how their responsibilities will change as a result of the introduction of the new product or process.  Include also numbers of people to be trained, by job category and geographic location.
<p>
<B>III.  Objectives</B>
<p>
This should describe exactly what the target audience will be required to do as a result of going through the training.  Each objective should be listed.
<p>
<B>IV.  Project Details</B>
<p>
This section should include:
<p>
__   Brief summaries of needs and task analyses, if any
<p>
__   Brief summaries of content and suggested treatment, if applicable
<p>
__   Description of anticipated project team organization, especially reporting relationships among your team and other players
<p>
__   Description of your ultimate client
<p>
__   Description of required development process and revision cycles
<p>
__   Listing of expected deliverables, if appropriate
<p>
__   Information on standards of quality and quantity 
<p>
<B>V.  Constraints on Budget, Schedule, and Design</B>
<p>
This section should describe:  
<p>
__   How much money may be spent with the vendor on this project (budget boundaries)
<p>
__   Specific dates for completion of milestones such as: the analysis*, design plans, drafts, test sessions, master deliverables, and reproduced copies to the field
<p>
__   Implementation plans (locations, dates, types and numbers of instructors, etc.)
<p>
__   Constraints on the design such as a need to deliver the training in a self-study format, on interactive videodisc, or whatever
<p>
*This assumes that you are requesting that the vendor complete the analysis.  You might consider doing the analysis yourself.
<p>
<B>VI.  Resources Provided</B>
<p>
This section should describe the resources to be provided by you. Specifically, it should include a description of the subject matter experts, market research, technical documentation, equipment or facilities, and any other resources that will provided to the vendor during the development process.
<p>
<B>VII.  Criteria for Evaluating Success of the Training</B>
<p>
This is a statement of specifically how the completed training will be judged by you and/or your client to be successful.  
<p>
<B>VIII.  Criteria for Selecting a Vendor</B>
<p>
This is a list of the criteria which will be used to determine the best vendor proposal.  Typical criteria include: vendor quality as evidenced in samples of work, vendor price, vendor's understanding of the product class (subject matter), track record within you, quality of proposed solution, creative use of media, and so on. 
<p>
If you intend to use a weighting method (for example, assign twice as much value to creative use of media as you assign to price) then describe this weighting system to the vendor. 
<p>
<B>IX.  Requests for Vendor Suggestion or Creativity</B>
<p>
This includes areas in which you are uncertain about the strategy and seek vendor recommendations.  It can also include areas in which you are flexible regarding design.
<p> 
Vendors are often experienced professionals who are capable of conceiving several creative alternatives.  However, if your RFP leaves the vendor with the impression that you have already locked in on a specific mode of instruction (self-study, driven by audio tape, for example), vendors are not likely to propose something drastically different.  After all, they want your business!
<p>
Therefore, you should openly state those areas in which you are flexible or seek vendor recommendations.
<p>
<B>X.  Terms and Conditions</B>
<p>
Attach blank contract or spell out special conditions/requirements that vendors must meet.
<p>
<br>
<B>TEMPLATE</B>
<p>
Your Request for Proposal should contain all the parts listed below.  Check off those which are actually present:

<p>
<OL>
<LI>Consider each guideline and incorporate the ones appropriate to your context into the screen design specifications for your program.
<p>  
<li>The sample screens below were taken from "Macintosh Fundamentals and Beyond," an award-winning training course from Apple Computer, Inc. developed in 1989.        
</ol>  
<p>
<hr size=2>
<center><H2>Text Design Guidelines</H2></center>
<p>
<center>Prepared by Thomas C. Reeves, Ph.D.  1994</center>
<p>
(The sample screens below were taken from "Macintosh Fundamentals and Beyond," an award-winning training course from Apple Computer, Inc. developed in 1989.)
<p>

<B>Rule 1 - Show consideration for users by designing for "user friendliness."</B> 
<p>

A critical factor of "user friendliness" is making your IMM program as clear and elegant as possible.  Although your program may include other media, text will continue to play a major role in most IMM programs.  Therefore considerable design effort should be made to assure that text is an effective and efficient component of the overall program.  
<p>
<B>Rule 2 - Use balance and symmetry.</B> 
<p>
Balance a menu or portion of text with graphics to focus the learners attention.  In the "Macintosh Fundamentals and Beyond" (MFB) course, each of the module menus employs a consistent menu structure and graphical layout.
<p>
<B>Rule 3 - Keep displays predictable and regular.</B>
<p>
Once a display structure is established, use it consistently.  There will be times when varying display structure will be appropriate, but any modification should be based upon instructional requirements rather than change for its own sake.  An easily understandable  structure is one of the most important components of a IMM course.  In MFB, all modules contained the same five basic sections, and these were displayed using a consistent 
textual and graphical display.
<p>
<B>Rule 4 - Use the appropriate display rate.</B>
<p>	
Produce visually pleasing arrangements of graphics and text that permit students to focus on the important points without strain or confusion.  Keep the length of text sections to relatively brief paragraphs that convey one main idea.   Generally, it is better to display all the text that will appear on a single screen at the same time.  In this way, the learner can decide what they want to read, skim, review, etc. in order to synthesize the content.
<p>
<B>Rule 5 - Avoid the "electronic page-turner."</B>
<p>
Rather than provide all the content in a long linear stream, permit learners to direct their own learning.   This can be done by using menus that allow learners to select the order in which to consider topics.  Provide cues as to what has been completed and what remains to be done.  A "fresh" menu of options in the MFB course is represented by unfilled "diamonds" next to the choices.  The diamonds are filled in as the learner progresses through the material.
<p>
<B>Rule 6 - Maintain unity and simplicity.</B>
<p>
There is research that supports "low density" as opposed to "high density" text in IMM.  Researchers eliminated more than 40% of the text in normal IMM displays, and student performance was held constant while the time for training was shortened!  Subject matter experts and especially instructional designers sometimes include too much detail when displaying content on the screen.  Provide the main ideas and a means of getting more information for those who might need or desire it.  
<p>
<B>Rule 7 - Create sensible groupings.</B>
<p>
Here are some guidelines for formatting groupings:
<UL>
<LI>Use a bullet typographical character, if possible, or other character such as the tilde (`) or a hyphen (-).
<LI>Begin each item with a capital letter.
<LI>Set items flush left.
<LI>Omit punctuation marks to separate entries unless the entry is a sentence.  
<LI>End sentences with periods.
<LI>Arrange lists vertically and avoid using commas to mark separate items.
<li>Keep overall density levels at 25 to 40 percent of the screen.
</UL>
<p>
<B>Rule 8 - Place primary material at the upper left corner of the screen.</B>
<p>	
In Western cultures, people tend to read from left to right and from top to bottom.  Place the title of a screen in the upper left hand corner so that learners perceive the main thrust of a screen right away.  (Note that in a series of screens, it is a good idea to provide learners with an idea of how many screens there are and where they are in the sequence.)  
<p>
<B>Rule 9 - Place prompts and locators consistently on screens.</B>  
<p>	
Navigation is a major challenge in any IMM program.  Place control options in consistent areas of the screen.  In MFB, the main control options are displayed in a black bar displayed on the right hand side of the screen.  Unique controls for specific screens are displayed in a prominent manner.  After an orientation and a little experience with a well-designed IMM program, the "cognitive demands" of the interface are reduced, and learners can focus on the content.  
<p>
<B>Rule 10 - Limit line length to 40 to 60 characters</B>
<p>	
Text lines longer than 60 characters are hard to read because the eye has to shift too wide a distance to read from line to line without losing place.  In MFB, text sometimes averaged 60 characters, but more often narrower lines of text were displayed, as illustrated on this screen.
<p>
<B>Rule 11 - Provide generous use of open space.</B> 
<p>	
Research has demonstrated that improvements in the use of white space increase ease of reading more than improvements in style.  Leaving blank lines between paragraphs helps.  Of course, it is important that screens contain important "chunks" of content .  Generally, research supports a screen density of 25 to 40 percent. 
<p>
<B>Rule 12 - Left-justify text, but do not right-justify it.</B>
<p>	
When you right-justify text, the spaces interrupt eye movement and slow down reading.  Left-justification, however, supports the general tendencies of how Western learners read.
<p>
<B>Rule 13 - Use mixed type sizes and styles to emphasize certain materials and provide variety.</B>  
<p>	 
Here are some guidelines for fonts:
<UL>
<LI>Use lowercase and uppercase in text sections.
<LI>Consider all uppercase for emphasis in captions or labels, but realize that all uppercase letters generally reduce legibility and slow down reading.  
<li>Serif type faces are slightly more legible than san serif when all other things are equal.  (This is a controversial issue.)
</UL>
<p>
<B>Rule 14 - Organize complex information into tables.</B> 
<p>	
Just as a picture can be worth a thousand words, a table can summarize complex information in a manner that supports learning.  However, good tables are difficult to create.  It is generally not a good idea to display very complex tables in IMM, but simple tables can be quite effective.
<p>
<B>Rule 15 - Emphasize with text attributes.</B>
<p> 
Here are some guidelines for text attributes:
Use highlighting or boldface to draw attention to the main points.
Underlining rarely looks good on a IMM screen.
Blinking should only be used in critical situations.  It is distracting.
Vary the size and rotation of text to attract attention.
Scrolling text is generally not sound practice in IMM.
Multiple fonts should rarely be used.  Pick a good font and work with its different styles.

<center><h3>Definitions for User Interface Rating Tool</h3></center>
<p>
<B>User Interface Dimension 1 - Ease of Use</B>
<p>
"Ease of Use" is concerned with the perceived facility with which a user interacts with an interactive multimedia program.  Figure 1 illustrates a dimension of such a program ranging from the perception that the program is very difficult to use to one that is perceived as being very easy to use.  Like many of the dimensions described in this tool, ease of use is both an aggregate and individual dimension.  For example, in the aggregate sense, the Windows interface is generally perceived as easier to use than the command interface of the Microsoft disk operating system (MS DOS).  However, in the individual sense, some people may perceive the MS-DOS interface to be easier to use because of their own unique experiences and attributes.  
<p>
<center><IMG align=middle SRC="gifs/fig1.GIF"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 1.  "Ease of Use" dimension of user interface.</center>  
<p>
User interface dimensions may be highly correlated with how well users enjoy using a specific program.  Whether users like a program may be more or less important, depending on the intent of the program and the context for its use.  Certainly, not liking an interactive program that is intended to be highly motivating is a major problem, whereas users' affect for a program may be less important in a training context in which strong extrinsic motivational factors exist.  Nonetheless, in the long run, improving the user interface dimensions of multimedia, such as "ease of use," is a highly desirable goal, regardless of context.  
<p>
<B>User Interface Dimension 2 - Navigation</B>
<p>
"Navigation" is concerned with the perceived ability to move through the contents of an interactive program in an intentional manner.  Figure 2 illustrates a dimension of interactive multimedia ranging from the perception that a program is difficult to navigate to one that is perceived as being easy to navigate.  An important aspect of navigation is orientation, i.e., the degree to which a user feels that he/she knows where he/she is in a program and how to go to another part of it.  This is a critical variable because users frequently complain of being lost in a interactive program (Utting & Yankelovitch, 1989).  Designers use several ways of supporting navigation and maintaining orientation.  A popular approach to navigation is the WIMP (window-icons-mouse-pointing) interface. 
<p>
<center><IMG align=middle SRC="gifs/fig2.GIF"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 2.  "Navigation" dimension of user interface.</center>  
<p>
<B> User Interface Dimension 3 - Cognitive Load</B>
<p>
Using an interactive program requires different mental efforts than performing tasks via print or other media.  In order to make any meaningful response to an interactive program, users must cope with and integrate at least three cognitive loads or demands, i.e., (a) the content of the program, (b) its structure, and (c) the response options available.  To use interactive programs, users must perceive options, conceptualize a choice, and make some physical action, all while mentally coordinating the demands of these three cognitive loads.  The user interface is the vehicle that allows perceptual, conceptual, and physical contacts with the interactive program.  In terms of "cognitive load," the user interface can seem unmanageable (i.e., confusing) at one end of the continuum and easily manageable (i.e., intuitive) at the other end (see Figure 3).   
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="gifs/fig3.GIF"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 3.  "Cognitive Load" dimension of user interface.</center>  
<p>
Learners acquire and structure information delivered via interfaces, conduct mental operations, and accomplish physical activities during their interactions with interactive multimedia.  The limited capacity of working memory to hold only five to nine chunks of information simultaneously makes it difficult for users of complexity structured programs to reason when numerous cognitive load factors must be handled simultaneously.  Users may feel overwhelmed by numerous options that increase the cognitive load.  The risks of confusion are especially high when users confront programs which by their very nature include many interactive options.  The possibility of user disorientation is a major concern in the increasingly popular multimedia programs that feature a complex, flexible structure.   
<p>
<B>User Interface Dimension 4 - Mapping</B>
<p>
"Mapping" refers to the program's ability to track and graphically represent to the user his or her path through the program.  In complex, non-linear programs, user-disorientation can be alleviated if users can see what parts of the system they have already accessed.  Utting and Yankelovitch (1989) discuss user disorientation as referring to, among other things, the user's not knowing "the boundaries of the information space."  Having a detailed mapping system gives users an aid in understanding which parts and how much of the information space they have interacted with, and conversely which parts and how much of it they haven't.  Interactive programs fall in a continuum of containing no mapping function to an appropriately powerful mapping function (see Figure 4).
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="gifs/fig4.GIF"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 4.  "Mapping" dimension of user interface.</center>  
<p>
The notion of an "appropriately powerful" mapping function requires some explanation.  Just as it is important to possess a map of the most usable scale when taking a road trip, it is important for interactive programs to provide enough, but not too much, detail in showing user paths.  A map that shows every piece of a program's knowledge space might prove to be so tedious or unwieldy as to be of as little value as an interactive program with no map.
<p>
<B>User Interface Dimension 5 - Screen Design</B>
<p>
"Screen Design" is a particularly complex dimension of interactive programs that can easily be broken down into many sub-dimensions related to text, icons, graphics, color, and other visual aspects of interactive programs.  Shneiderman (1987) maintains that although certain design principles have been established, "screen design will always have elements of art and require invention" (p. 326).  A separate dimension has been defined to deal with the artistic aspects of interactive programs (see Dimension 9 - Aesthetics below).  We define "screen design" as a dimension ranging from substantial violations of principles of screen design to general adherence to principles of screen design (see Figure 5).    
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="gifs/fig5.GIF"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 5.  "Screen Design" dimension of user interface.</center>  
<p> 
There are two problems with this dimension.  First, screen design principles have not kept up with the rapidly changing nature of interactive technology.  Second, creative designers may sometimes intentionally violate screen design principles for effect or to otherwise focus the user's attention.  Nonetheless, we think that there exists enough knowledge about the principles of screen design that people, particularly experienced designers, can make meaningful distinctions among poorly and well designed screens in interactive programs.
<p>
<B>User Interface Dimension 6 - Knowledge Space Compatibility</B>
<p>
"Knowledge space" refers to the network of concepts and relationships that compose the mental schema a user possesses about a given phenomena, topic or process.  Subject matter experts and/or designers of interactive programs are generally perceived as possessing an expert knowledge space with respect to the content included in the programs they create.  This expertise usually is the basis for the structure of the knowledge or information presented in a program.  Novice users, on the other hand, often possess an inadequate knowledge space with respect to the content of a program.  The knowledge space of novices may be inadequate because of ignorance, misconceptions, or some blending of ignorance and misconceptions.  When a novice user initiates a search for information in an interactive program, the interface should be powerful enough so that the user perceives the resulting information as compatible with his or her current knowledge space (see Figure 6).  If the information received is not perceived as relevant to the search strategies used by the user, the system will be perceived as incompatible.  
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="gifs/fig6.GIF"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 6.  "Knowledge Space Compatibility" dimension of user interface.</center>  
<p> 
Admittedly, this is a very difficult dimension to judge.  However, if a user initiates a search for information about a topic, e.g., the procedures for installing new software, the resulting information should seem compatible with that search once the information is thoroughly explored.  If the information seems arbitrary or irrelevant to the search that was initiated, the knowledge space representation should be judged as incompatible.  
<p>
<B>User Interface Dimension 7 - Information Presentation</B>
<p>
The "Information Presentation" dimension is concerned with whether the information contained in the knowledge space of an interactive program is presented in an understandable form.  The most elegantly designed user interface for an interactive  program is useless if the information it is intended to present is incomprehensible to the user.  Certainly the user might be able to find all of the information about a subject, but whether the user could then comprehend, understand, or learn that information is another matter.  Imagine a complicated installation procedure presented in textual form, written in a stream of consciousness style reminiscent of James Joyce's Ulysses.  Or consider a video presentation on sales techniques for ATMs, directed and produced by Andy Warhol.  In each case the information requisite for understanding may be present, but would probably be difficult if not impossible to comprehend.  Information presentation is defined as a dimension ranging from obtuse to clear (see Figure 7).
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="gifs/fig7.GIF"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 7.  "Information Presentation" dimension of user interface.</center>  
<p> 
<B>User Interface Dimension 8 - Media Integration</B>
<p>
The most important aspect of the media integration dimension refers to how well an interactive program combines different media to produce an effective whole.  Do the various media (text, graphics, audio, video, etc.) work together to form one cohesive program, or is the program a hodgepodge of gratuitous media segments?  Are the various media components necessary to the function of the program or would the program function equally as well without them?  The media integration dimension is defined as ranging from uncoordinated to coordinated (see Figure 8).
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="gifs/fig6.GIF"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 8.  "Media Integration" dimension of user interface.</center>  
<p> 
<B>User Interface Dimension 9 - Aesthetics</B>
<p>
"Aesthetics" refers to the artistic aspects of interactive programs in the sense of possessing beauty or elegance.  In the aggregate sense, many people may praise the aesthetics of an automobile design or the elegance of a bridal gown.  However, in an individual sense, aesthetics are highly unique and one person's sense of the beautiful may seem grotesque to another.  Eisner (1985) described the need to develop "connoisseurs" in evaluation of education and training, just as we have connoisseurs in the arts.  Connoisseurs have refined tastes and a deep sensitivity to aesthetics that enable them to criticize phenomena (e.g., plays, paintings, musical scores, or interactive programs) in a manner that can be communicated to others.  In turn, other people, perhaps less refined and less sensitive, may become more informed by "consuming" the expert reviews provided by the connoisseurs.  In the absence of such connoisseurs, the aesthetics dimension of the user interface of an interactive multimedia program is defined as ranging from displeasing to pleasing (see Figure 9).  
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="gifs/fig6.GIF"></center>
<p>
<center>Figure 9.  "Aesthetics" dimension of user interface.</center>  
<p> 
<B>User Interface Dimension 10 - Overall Functionality</B>
<p>
"Overall Functionality" is an aspect of interactive multimedia programs related to the perceived utility of the program.  The perceived functionality of an interactive program is obviously highly related to the intended use of the program.  A given program may have multiple uses.  Its overall functionality must be judged in relation to the specific intended use that exists in the mind of the users.  Figure 10 illustrates a dimension of the user interface of interactive programs that ranges from dysfunctional to highly functional.

A good way to demonstrate the knowledge you gained by exploring this case study would be to write a report, discussing the issues involved in the recycling of a product of your choice, that answers the following questions:<p>
<UL>
<LI>What is the motivation behind recycling this product?
<LI>What percent of the product is recyclable? What impact does this product have on the environment? Perform a Life Cycle Analysis and Assessment on the product.
<LI>How can the product be "reincarnated" instead of thrown away.  Discuss this in terms of reusing the product, recycling its materials, and/ or extracting the energy stored in the product.
<LI>Discuss the economic feasibility of recycling this product. If money cannot be made by recycling it, how do we improve things to make recycling profitable?  What are the limiting factors?
<li>Finally, discuss the future of the product in terms of recycling. What problems might be looming in the future?  What improvements might be made to help this product become 100% recyclable?

<h1>Introduction To Automobile Recycling</h1>

A critical issue in sustainable technology is the preservation of resources.  In an industrial context, we can distinguish two broad categories of resources;  materials and energy.  One way to conserve resources is recycling.  This case highlights some of the ongoing issues and work in the recycling of automobiles.<p>
In Europe, automanufacturers have been asked to investigate the possibility of recycling their cars to avoid waste.  The dwindling landfill space in an overcrowded Europe has resulted in tough European legislation regarding the post-use stage of a product's life cycle (such as reuse/recycling).  There is also interest in the U.S.; the Big Three (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) have formed the Vehicle Recycling Partnership, which has been studying vehicle dismantling, and the American Automotive Manufacturers Association has come out with definitions regarding recycling. <p> 
<hr>
The main point of this case study is to fully explore the issue of recycling automobiles and everything that is involved, but its purpose is to get you to learn the basics behind recycling, and how to apply this knowledge to other products.<p>
<UL>
<LI>The first issue is the motivation behind recycling; in the case of automobiles, it is the recent legislation in Europe.
<LI>Secondly is the assessment of a product; how recyclable is it and what is its environmental impact?
<LI>Next is the issue of closing the product's life cycle loop, i.e., after the product has finished its useful life, how to "reincarnate" the product instead of landfilling it.  This can be done through reusing the product, recycling its materials, or extracting the energy stored in the product.
<LI>Following this is the economic feasability of recycling a product.  If money cannot be made by recycling it, how do we improve things to make recycling profitable?  What are the limiting factors?
<li>Finally, what is the future of the product, its production, etc., and what problems might be looming in the future?<p>
</UL>
These topics are all covered in this study, with a focus on the automobile.<p>

<title>LEGISLATION</title>
</head>
<body>




<h1>Legislation</h1>
<IMG SRC="joebob.gif">
<A HREF="LegQ.html">Legislation Questions</A><p>

The post-use stage of a product's life cycle is currently receiving a large amount of attention.  The motivation and growing interest in recycling of automobiles has primarily been created by legislation.<p>  

<H2>German Legislation</H2>

A major driving force is the so-called German take-back law.  This law has two aspects:<p>


<UL>
<LI>The proposed German "Take-Back Law" requires all automobile manufacturers to take back all vehicles which were ever sold in that country.  This program would start January 1, 1995.
<LI>In addition, proposed German law requires automobile manufacturers to meet recycling targets with components and materials from the dismantled vehicles.
</UL>


In Table 1, the recycling target levels are given for the German proposal.  Note the increases in certain areas.  In particular, the recycling targets for <B>plastics</B> will be raised from 20 % in 1996 to 80 % in the year 2000.<p>  
<pre>
<H3>Table 1: Reuse and Material Recycling Targets in % by weight
				(GermanProposal)</H3>

<b>Material              1996        2000</b>                
Steel                     100 %        100 %               
Non-Ferrous Metal          88 %         90 %                
Plastics                   20 %         80 %                
Tires                      70 %         80 %                
Other Elastomers           30 %         50 %                
Glass                      30 %         60 %                
Other Fractions            30 %         50 %
</pre>          
 <p>
The German law was supposed to go in effect on January 1, 1995.  However, upcoming elections have caused delays in implementing the law.<p>
<hr>
<h2>European Legislation</h2>

The European Commission is also working on similar take back legislation.  The specific objectives are:<p>
<ul>
<li>avoidance of waste,
<li>reduction of landfill demand, and
<li>reduction of toxicity
</ul>
In addition, the following limits are set on the maximum allowable percentage of a car that can be landfilled:<p> 
<ul>
<li>Beginning in 2002, a maximum of 15% of car weight can be landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery.
<li>For new models beginning in 2002, a maximum of 10% of car weight can be disposed.
<li>A maximum of 5% of car weight disposal in 2015.
</ul>

These "threats" have caused car manufacturers to cooperate rather than to compete.  The following are some examples of efforts being undertaken.<p>
<ul>
<li>Under pressure by their European governments, European car manufacturers have already invested large efforts in studying the recyclability of their products.  Their primary focus is on recovering large volumes of plastics  <A HREF="References.html">[1, 2, 8-11]</A> .  Weber provides a good overview on the efforts of the German auto-industry with respect to plastic recycling  <A HREF="References.html#9">[9]</A> .  Weber lists some studies which have been performed by Volkswagen with respect to the man-hours required to disassemble certain car parts to be recycled.
<li>Several international initiatives are also underway in Europe.  Eurekar, one such initiative, consists of a number of non-German European car manufacturers and the Chrysler Corporation.  
<li>In the U.S., the Big Three (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) have formed the Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP).  The VRP has established a Vehicle Dismantling Center in Detroit where automotive dismantling studies are being performed.
<li>In order to standardize the terms, the American Automotive Manufacturers Association has come out with definitions regarding recycling.
</ul>

<TITLE>ASSESSMENT</TITLE>
</head>
<body>




<h1>Assessment</h1>
<IMG SRC="joebob.gif">
<A HREF="AsseQ.html">Assessment Questions</A>

<h2>Recyclability of a Product</h2>  

A critical issue is the assessment of recyclability.  A uniform calculation is needed in conjunction with the German and European legislation.  In order to assist in "measuring" recyclability, the VRP is defining the following five categories of recycling:<p>

Category :<p>

<ol>
<li><B>Recyclable - infrastructure and technology clearly defined</B>.
-	Part is completely recyclable (or reusable), infrastructure clearly defined and functioning (e.g., body sheet metal, engine blocks).
<li><B>Potentially recyclable, but no infrastructure is available.</B>
-	Collection network not defined or organized (e.g., plastic interior trim).
<li><B>Potentially recyclable, but process or material development is required</B>.
-	Technology has not been commercialized (e.g., glass-fiber recycling).
<li><B>Energy recovery potential.</B>
-	Known technology/capacity to produce energy with economic value (e.g., pyrolysis of tires).
<li><B>No potential for recycling known.</B>
-	Recyclability technology not known (e.g., leather trim).
</ol>

The work is still ongoing and the categories are not finalized yet.  Using these categories, a vehicle's recyclability can be calculated.  Currently, a vehicle's recyclability is calculated as follows.<p>  
<ul>
<li>First, the weight of all the components of a car which are "category 1" recyclable is summed.
<li>Next, this weight is divided by the total weight of the vehicle and the resulting number indicates the fraction recyclability of a vehicle.
</ul>

This calculation can be done for any product.  The advantage is that the calculation is relatively simple.  The disadvantage is that it only focuses on category 1;  all other categories are excluded from the assessment.<p>
Another way in which products can be assessed is through a Life Cycle Assessment.<p>
<hr>
<h2>Environmental Impact - Life Cycle Analysis</h2>

Some people argue that environmental friendliness should be measured in units of energy.  The less energy it costs to make a product, the better it is.  This notion has led to so-called Life Cycle Analysis/Assessment (LCA) approaches.  Life cycle analysis (or assessment) is a method in which the energy and raw material consumption, different types of emissions and other important factors related to a specific product are being measured, analyzed and summoned over the products entire life cycle, from an environmental point of view.  The EPA has some good reports on LCA.  They form the most comprehensive tools to be used to support green engineering.  Good overviews on LCAs are given in  <A HREF="References.html#14">[14-17]</A> .  The strength of LCA is the (potential) broadness of scope and depth of evaluation.  However, this strength is also its major weakness at the moment.  Designers find it almost impossible to practically work with LCAs, because the LCA tools have a tendency to be as complex as the issue under investigation.  Recognized problems with LCAs are the consistent lack of solid data about all aspects of a products life cycle, the nearly infinite amount of decisions to be made, the lack of standardization resulting in numerous conversions, and the lack of a standard evaluation scheme caused by and resulting in different views on what is right  <A HREF="References.html#16">[16]</A> . <p>

<H1>Closing the Loop</H1>
<IMG SRC="joebob.gif">
<A HREF="CLoopQ.html">Closing the Loop Questions</A><p>

When people talk about "recycling", they often refer to post-use recycling, that is, the recycling of a product (or material) after it has been used by a consumer.  It is important to note that recycling is not the only aspect which makes a product sustainable or environmentally benign.  In Figure 1, a number of additional aspects are given.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=top SRC="Figures/Fig1.GIF"><p>
<B>Figure 1 - Aspects of an Environmentally Benign and Sustainable Product</B><p>
<A NAME="Pre"><hr></A>

As is already highlighted in Figure 1, recycling can occur at different stages during a product's life-cycle.  Some organizations use the term <A HREF="PreConsumer.html">"pre-consumer recycling"</A> to characterize the recycling of waste that occurs during the manufacture of a product.  In Figure 2, a diagram of a system's life cycle is given, illustrating the different life-cycle stages.  The phrase "Cradle to Reincarnation" emphasizes the fact that products can be reincarnated into new (either higher or lower valued) products through recycling.  The phrase has evolved from the term "Design from Cradle to Grave" which emphasized the fact that one should think about what happens to a product / system once it has fulfilled its useful life.<p> 

<IMG SRC="Figures/Fig2.GIF"><p>
<B>Figure 2 - A System's Life-Cycle from Cradle-to-Reincarnation</B><p>

The term "demanufacture" is appearing more and more in the literature, especially in the electronics industry, to characterize the process opposite to manufacturing involved in recycling materials and products after a product has been taken back by a company.<p>
<hr>

<H2>Dismantling and Recycling - Strategies and Processes</H2>

The priorities in the context of take-back are as follows:<p>

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="Reuse.html">Reuse </A><A NAME="index1">(product recycling)</A>
<UL>
<LI>This has the highest priority from environmental point of view, because all resources (material and energy) put into product during manufacturing are preserved.  This often provides economic advantages as well.
<li>A "negative" aspect is that reuse requires non-destructive disassembly and additional inspection operations which increase the cost.
</UL>
<LI><A HREF="MatRecyc.html">Material recycling</A>
<UL>
<LI>This is the most common.
<LI>Only the materials are preserved, all geometric details are lost.
<LI>It allows for (cheap) destructive disassembly.
<li>In the electronics industry, material recycling is often done for the recovery of valuable material (e.g. gold and platinum).
</UL>
<LI><A HREF="EnergRec.html">Energy recovery</A>
<UL>
<LI>Only the energy embodied in materials is preserved through incineration or pyrolysis.
<li>Lowest revenues, but often the easiest to do.
</UL>.
</OL>

<H1>Economic Issues</H1><p>
<IMG SRC="joebob.gif">
<A HREF="EIQ.html">Questions on Economic Issues in Recycling
</A><p>
Economics form a major concern.  In fact, many European car manufacturers have throttled down on their efforts to create "green" cars because they started to realize that there are economic trade-offs.  Automobile take-back, dismantling, and recycling can have large associated costs.  Some common cost factors are:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Buy back of car ($/car).  Typically, this is dependent on condition and value of car type.  In some cases, there may not be a buy back cost.
<LI>Transportation costs ($/km).  These costs may also depend on weight and amount of damage tolerated.  Consider the difference in gas prices between Europe and the U.S.A.
<LI>Tip and storage fees ($/car).  You typically have to pay dumping material on a landfill.  The property on which cars are stored also costs money.  These costs are strongly influenced by location of the recycling facility and local legislation.
<LI>Labor cost ($/hour).  This speaks for itself.  However, labor costs also depend on the level of skills required.
<LI>Equipment investment cost ($) and operating cost ($/car, $/hr).  Influenced by the need for special (expensive) equipment and the depreciation rate of the equipment.
<li>Time necessary to recover parts and materials (hr/car).  This is strongly influenced by the design of the vehicle
</UL>.

In order to obtain a profit, these costs have to be offset by revenues.  Revenues in automobile recycling are obtained from:<p>

<UL>
<LI>High value (high demand), undamaged recovered reusable components.  Additional processing (cleaning, inspection, upgrading, reassembly, and redistribution) adds to costs.
<LI>High value, uncontaminated scrap materials.  Any contamination which reduces material properties depreciates the material value.
<li>Energy recovered and sold from incineration or pyrolysis.  This has the lowest revenue of all.
</UL>

In the article "Modeling the cost of plastic recycling" <A HREF="References.html#13"> [13]</A> , a Technical Cost Model approach is given which highlights the factors involved in recycling automobiles.  It also includes a table of material scrap prices given below.<p>

In the article "Activity-Based Costing in Design for Product Retirement" an overview of current costing approaches is given, as well as a simple <A HREF="ABC.html">Activity-Based Costing (ABC) model</A> for assessing the cost of product retirement.  The model has been implemented on a spreadsheet.  By changing the amount of material to be recovered by dismantling and shredding, dismantling times, landfill and transportation fees, different profitabilities can be obtained.  The model is simple, but realistic.  It can be used in a number of exercises related around the issue of economical and ecological tradeoffs.<p>

<H2>Future Automobile Waste</H2>
<P>
One of the major problems facing recycling is the uncertainties of the future.  Looking back over the past, we can see that vehicle production in the United States as well as in the entire world (Figures 5 and 6 respectively) have continued to rise since around the 1950s.  When you consider that the upward trend of automotive production has not yet shown significant signs of leveling off, it becomes obvious that the disposal needs will also continue to grow.  The typical life expectancy of a complex product like an automobile ranges from 10 to 15 years.  In other words we are currently attempting to dispose of vehicles produced in the early 1980's timeframe.<p>

<H2>Design Challenges</H2><P>
<P>
The most effective method to reduce the amount of material from automobiles which will end up in a landfill is to change the way in which automobiles are designed.  Vehicles need to be designed such that removal of reusable components is made easier, materials which are to be recycled are easier to remove and sort into base material components, and the amount of materials which are difficult to recycle are reduced.<P>
<P>
On the other side of the coin, any design changes which are made today will not cause an immediate change for 10 to 15 years.  Therefore the immediate challenge is to find more economically feasible methods - which are still ecologically sound - to recycle existing vehicles, and reduce the amount of vehicles and vehicular components landfilled annually.<P>

<H1>Lesson Closure</H1>


Because the car manufacturers in Europe are having to deal with the take-back legislation, a number of them are looking to contract third party dismantlers, such as <A HREF="DeMoss.html">De Mosselaar</A>, for taking back automobiles.  Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, on the other hand, are taking back their own vehicles and dismantling them in their respective plants, rather than using third party people. Volkswagen recovers its parts and then sells them through its own dealer network.  Mercedes also recovers its parts and resells them, but it also goes the additional step of recycling the materials from the non-salable components of the vehicles.  Interestingly, in the United States, anti-trust and monopoly laws largely prohibit GM, Ford, and Chrysler to join hands and control an economically feasible dismantling infrastructure in the US.  In Europe, car manufacturers are allowed to do this, or it is often condoned by the governments.<p>

<H1>User's Guide To The Case Study</H1>
<hr>
<H2>Accessing The World Wide Web </H2>
In order to read the text of this case study, a World Wide Web Browser is required.  In order to see the pictures and graphics, we suggest using a graphical user interface such as MacWeb, NCSA Mosaic, or Mosaic Netscape.<p>

<B>What Is The World Wide Web?</B><p>
The World Wide Web (WWW) is  a web of computer connections between computers around the globe.  Through the WWW, information can be obtained from any server connected to the web.<p>

<b> What Is A World Wide Web Browser?</b><P>
A WWW browser is a software application that allows its user to connect to WWW information and applications.  From some browsers, only text can be seen (these include Gopher, Wais and Lynx).  From others, text and graphics may be seen (such as Mosaic and Netscape browsers).<p> 

<B>What Is A Graphical User Interface?</B><P>
A graphical user interface is a WWW browser that contains hypermedia, a multimedia system that incorportates hypertext-style links embedded within documents [1].<p>

<B>What Is A  Hypertext File?</B><P>
A Hypertext file is a document that is connected electronically to other files which are accessed through embedded links in the document. This means that two linked files can be located in vastly different locations. <p>
For example, the document you are reading is a printed version of a hypertext file.  If you were to <A HREF="Example.html">CLICK HERE ON THIS UNDERLINED PORTION</A> you would link to another file located within the server.  (see page 2).<p>

If you would like more information on how to use NCSA Mosaic for Macintosh, see the <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/MacMosaic/Docs/MacMosa.0.html">NCSA User's Guide</A> at the address http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/MacMosaic/Docs/MacMosa.O.html.<p>

If you would like to know how to make your own hypertext pages on the WWW, see <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html">A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO HTML</A> at http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html.

<H2>Case Study Specific Information</H2>

The starting point for this case study is the course overview.  In the map below, the material to the right of the OVERVIEW block is the actual case study material on automobile recycling.  Within some of these sections, questions are linked at the section beginning, with the answers linked at the section bottom.<p>
<H3>Case Study Map</H3>
<IMG SRC="Pictures/Map.gif" width=100%>
<hr>
Also, there is an overall problem linked to the overview document.  By performing this exercise, the objectives of the case study will be addressed and hopefully internalized by the student.<p>

The ABC cost model refered to in the economics document can be downloaded and manipulated with to see the effects of the different factors in the model.<p>

<p>
Currently under development at the Georgia Tech Research Institute(GTRI) is the Virtual School of Manufacturing (VSM), a web-based curriculum for inclusion into the Globewide Network Academy (GNA).  This course module is a starting point for development of future courses that will be included in the VSM.
<p>
In this lesson on automobile recycling, you will be learning about recycling, reuse, and remanufacture of products, the automobile in particular .  It is important for you to learn the basics concepts, so think of how the ideas presented can apply to others products.  A good demonstration of your knowledge gained will be to address the <A HREF="Overallp.html">Overall Problem</A> developed for this lesson.
<p>
In the <A HREF="Menu.html">Main Menu</A>, a general outline with major topics is presented.  These topics can be used as links to the appropriate sections, or a you can use the course <A HREF="Map.html">Map</A> as a guide.  You can start wherever you like and always return to the main menu or map pages, though we suggest going through each whole section one at a time, starting with the introduction.
<p>
<blink>PLEASE NOTE</blink>:  Questions are linked to the beginning of some of the pages.  Please read these before reading the page.  After going through the section, try to answer the questions given.  Note that these questions are meant to spur your brain into reflecting on the material covered, thus direct answers may not be found in the text!!

<hr size=3>
<p> 

A good way to demonstrate the knowledge you gained by exploring this case study would be to write a report, discussing the issues involved in the recycling of a product of your choice, that answers the following questions:<p>
<UL>
<LI>What is the motivation behind recycling this product?
<LI>What percent of the product is recyclable? What impact does this product have on the environment? Perform a Life Cycle Analysis and Assessment on the product.
<LI>How can the product be "reincarnated" instead of thrown away.  Discuss this in terms of reusing the product, recycling its materials, and/ or extracting the energy stored in the product.
<LI>Discuss the economic feasibility of recycling this product. If money cannot be made by recycling it, how do we improve things to make recycling profitable?  What are the limiting factors?
<li>Finally, discuss the future of the product in terms of recycling. What problems might be looming in the future?  What improvements might be made to help this product become 100% recyclable? 
</UL>

<H2>Accessing The World Wide Web </H2>
In order to read the text of this case study, a World Wide Web Browser is required.  In order to see the pictures and graphics, we suggest using a graphical user interface such as MacWeb, NCSA Mosaic, or Mosaic Netscape.<p>

<B>What Is The World Wide Web?</B><p>
The World Wide Web (WWW) is  a web of computer connections between computers around the globe.  Through the WWW, information can be obtained from any server connected to the web.<p>

<b> What Is A World Wide Web Browser?</b><P>
A WWW browser is a software application that allows its user to connect to WWW information and applications.  From some browsers, only text can be seen (these include Gopher, Wais and Lynx).  From others, text and graphics may be seen (such as Mosaic and Netscape browsers).<p> 

<B>What Is A Graphical User Interface?</B><P>
A graphical user interface is a WWW browser that contains hypermedia, a multimedia system that incorportates hypertext-style links embedded within documents [1].<p>

<B>What Is A  Hypertext File?</B><P>
A Hypertext file is a document that is connected electronically to other files which are accessed through embedded links in the document. This means that two linked files can be located in vastly different locations. <p>
For example, the document you are reading is a printed version of a hypertext file.  If you were to <A HREF="Example.html">CLICK HERE ON THIS UNDERLINED PORTION</A> you would link to another file located within the server.  (see page 2).<p>

If you would like more information on how to use NCSA Mosaic for Macintosh, see the <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/MacMosaic/Docs/MacMosa.0.html">NCSA User's Guide</A> at the address http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/MacMosaic/Docs/MacMosa.O.html.<p>

If you would like to know how to make your own hypertext pages on the WWW, see <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html">A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO HTML</A> at http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html.

<H3>Check Out The<A HREF="Map.html">Courseware Map</H3></A>
for a look at the overall structure of this courseware.
<p>
<hr>
Also, there is an overall problem linked to the overview document.  By performing this exercise, the objectives of the case study will be addressed and hopefully internalized by the student.<p>

The ABC cost model refered to in the economics document can be downloaded and manipulated with to see the effects of the different factors in the model.<p>

<li><A HREF="#eval">evaluating its solution.</A>

<hr>
<A NAME="form"><H2>Formulating An Optimization Problem</H2></A>

<H3>Levels in modeling</H3>
Levels in modeling refers to the amount detail that is represented with a particular model.  Modeling costs are usually the most expensive in an optimization study, and these costs increase dramatically as the level of detail in the model increases.  Therefore, it is necessary to select a level that is appropriate for the specific study.  It is generally best to keep the model as simple as possible.  If more information is needed, it is best to start with a preliminary simple model and slowly build on it in a systematic and logical way.   Also remember, the model can only be as good as the information put into it (garbage in, garbage out).
<p>

<H3>Preparation for solution</H3>
The engineer building the model has particular choices in how the model will be implemented and used that have a considerable impact on its overall efficiency and effectiveness.  However, the engineer must also beware of having a particular solution technique in mind while building the model, so as not to force a model to fit a particular technique.  
<p>
Three types of activities are invovled when preparing the model for solution.  They are:
<UL>
<LI>Modifying it for numerical difficulties,
<LI>Modifying it to enhance efficiency, and
<li>Analysis of problem features
</UL>
Each of these activities is discussed further as follows:
<p>
<H4>Modifications for numerical difficulties</H4>
Numerical difficulties can cause premature termination of th eoptimization or even an abort.  Luckily, these situations can usually be eliminated by simple problem modifications.
<UL>
<LI>     <I>Scaling</I> - This refers to the relative magnitude of quantities in the model.  Both variables and constraints can be scaled.  Generally, it is best if the constraint gradients take on similar values and the constraint themselves exhibit similar sensitivities to variable changes.<p>  
<LI>      <I>Inconsistencies</I> - These can occur between the model function and derivative values.  These can be avoided by computing gradients through numerical differencing.<p> 
<LI>      <I>Nondifferentiability</I> - Nondifferentiable model elements can cause difficulties when gradients are evaluated.  This typically happens in the vacinity of the switching point of a max/min operator or a conditional statement.  Max/min operators can be eliminated by replacement with multiple inequalities.<p>
<li>      <I>Invalid arguments</I> - These frequently occur in expressions such as a log of a negative number.  This can be avoided by placing constraints of small tolerance value when values go to zero.<p>
</UL>
<H4>Modifications to enhance efficiency</H4>
In an attempt to speed up the computation, it is of benefit to reduce the number of constraints, particularly the nonlinear ones, and also reduce the number of variables.  This can be done through the methods described next. 
<UL>
<LI>      <I>Function transformation</I> - At times, by manipulating or rearranging algebraically, nonlinear constraints can be easily converted to linear ones.  Sometimes, equality constraints can be replaced by an inequality constraint that is the limiting side at the optimum. <p>  
<LI>      <I>Variable transformation</I> - Variable transformations can be used to simplify or eliminate constraints.  They must be used with care because one can introduce complications with them.<p> 
<LI>      <I>Redundancy elimination</I> -The solution efficiency can be enhanced if redundant constraints and bounds are eliminated.  Many times these can be recognized just through inspection.<p>
<li>      <I>Equation sequencing</I> - By explicitly or implicitly solving some of the equality constraints and using them to eliminate variables, the problem can be simplified.<p> 
</UL>
<H4>Analysis of problem features</H4>
Different structural features of the problem formulation will have an impact on the solution process.  These features are discussed as follows:
<UL>
<LI>      <I>Convexity</I> - Convexity can be very cumbersome to prove.  However, it is much easier to identify if the problem is not convex.  The nonlinear constraints should be tested first, followed by the objective function.  If the problem is found to be nonconvex, then it is very possible that there will be multiple local solutions.<p>
<LI>      <I>Boundedness</I> - The possibility of model unboundedness should always be considered.  These occurances can many times be identified through examination of the model.  Otherwise, variable or partial derivative tests may be applied.  Imposing upper and lower bounds on all variables is one sure way to eliminate unboundedness, but one needs to avoid redundant constraints.<p>  
<LI>      <I>Solution uniqueness</I> - Another consideration is multiple local minima, or solutions that are not unique.  While convexity can assure a global optimum, it does not assure a unique solution.  The most common cause for this is the occurance of fixed combinations of two or more variables throughout the model.  Generally, this occurs when some constraints or realtions were omitted.<p>
<li>      <I>Feasibility</I> - Sometimes the constraints end up excluding all possible solutions.  Therefore, the model shoudl be checked for feasibility.  By finding a feasible starting point, one is assured of having a feasible solution.  A feasible starting point can be determined through either random sampling, minimization of unconstrained penalty-type functions, and sequential constraint minimization.
</UL>
<hr>


<A NAME="solv"><H2>Solving An Optimization Problem</H2></A>
Usually, a number of different strategies can be used to carry out the optimization.  It is sometime beneficial to consider alternatives such as sequential optimization of a series of sub-problems.  When conducting this part of the ooptimization study, be rigorously and wary of computer program bugs and glitches.  If, from solving the model, multiple local minimum are expected, then some strategy must be used to determine a global minimum.
<p>
<H3>Specialized strategies</H3>
Generally, specialized methods will be prefered over general-purpose methods, even though specialized techniques usually take more time to set up.  If repeated solutions are sought for a class of problems with similar structure, then specialized strategies are worthwhile setting up and using.
<p>
<H3>Global optimization</H3>
If multiple local minima are expected, what strategies can be used to find the global minimum?  The simplest and most widely used strategy is the multistart, where multiple optimization runs are started from different starting points.  The starting points can be determined randomly or from a deterministic grid.  The only theoretically based strategies have been developed for specially structured problems.
<p>

<hr>
<A NAME="eval"><H2>Evaluating The Solution</H2></A>
Two methods for evaluating the solution should be performed:
solution validation and sensitivity analysis.
<p>

<H3>Solution validation</H3>
A solution is valid if:
<UL>
<LI>it is a realizable state of the system under consideration, and
<li>it is the optimum state of the system.
</UL>
All models have certain limitations.  To verify that a solution is realizable, the solution must be reviewed under the model limitations to assure that it does not exceed them.  The model's limitations can be determined by systematically varying parameters in both the model and the real system and seeing whether the behaviors match.  Also, artificial tests such as using extreme values can be used.
<p>
Next it is necessary to determine if the solution is the optimum.  The focus here should not be a mathematical proof, but using judgement and reason to explain why the solution is the optimum.  One way to do this is to use simplified models to identify trends and check that the solutions does follow the trends noted.
<p>
<H3>Sensitivity analysis</H3>
Normally, it is not the solution that provides the key insights into the problem, but the information gained about the system state in the solution's vicinity.  This information is obtained through a sensitivity analysis.  This entails determining the sensitivity of the solution to the various model parameters and assumptions.  This type of information is normally generated through either Lagrange multiplier values or parameter case study runs. <p>

<p>

<hr size=3 width=400 align=center>
<H2>What Is The GAA All About?</H2>
Because of the steady decline of the General Aviation industry over the past fifteen years, universities have drifted away from General Aviation as an area for teaching and research.  Consequently, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are sponsoring a General Aviation Design Competition for U.S. aeronautical and engineering students.  The purpose of this competition is to increase academic involvement in the revitalization of the U.S. General Aviation industry.<p>

For this competition, a General Aviation aircraft is defined as a<br>
<UL>
<LI>fixed-wing,
<LI>single-engine,
<LI>single-pilot,
<LI>propeller driven aircraft for
<LI>2-6 passengers which can
<LI>cruise at 150-300 kts and has a  
<li>range of 800-1000 miles.
</UL>
The Georgia Institute of Technology has entered this competition as a collaboration of students in mechanical and aerospace engineering, among other disciplines.  As a part of ME8104 in the winter quarter of 1995, Wei Chen, Jack Elliot, Tim Simpson, and Jacques Virasak investegated the design of the GAA as an open system, a portion of this being implementation of a Compromise DSP.  The material shown here is used as an example on how they implemented a Compromise DSP in this project.  This example includes:<br> 
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#start">getting started with the GAA,</A>
<LI><A HREF="#form">the GAA Compromise DSP formulation,</A>
<LI><A HREF="#solv">solving  the GAA Compromise DSP,</A> and
<li><A HREF="#eval">the evaluation of the GAA results.</A>
</UL>

<hr>
<A NAME="start"><H2>Getting Started With The GAA</H2></A>
Before the Compromise DSP can be formulated, three things must be determined:
<OL>
<LI>a <A HREF="#mission">mission profile</A>  for a General Aviation aircraft,
<li>a <A HREF="#baseline">baseline model </A>to provide a starting point for the Compromise DSP, and
<li>the design <A HREF="#vcg">variables, constraints and goals</A>.
</OL>  

<A NAME="mission"><H3>Mission Profile</H3></A> 
Based on the survey performed in the AE8113 class in the Fall of 1994  (Huh, An et al. 1994) , the flight mission for the General Aviation aircraft is illustrated in the following figure.<p>

<IMG SRC="fig2.gif">
<CENTER><B>Figure 2- GAA Mission Profile</B></CENTER> 
<p>
As is specified in the GAA competition guidelines  (NASA and FAA 1994) , the aircraft is required to fly at 150-300 kts (0.24 to 0.48 Mach) for a range of 800-1000 nautical miles.  The mission profile in the above figure has a cruise speed of 0.31 Mach (&ap;200 kts) and a range of 900 n.m.  These values will be used as the initial mission profile.  Now for the baseline model.<p>

<A NAME="baseline"><H3>Baseline Model</H3></A>
The GAA design configuration baseline originates from the aerospace engineering (AE) student GAA design team in AE6530.  The GAA design data are derived from an existing General Aviation aircraft, Beechcraft Bonanza B36TC.  There are several reasons that the Bonanza B36TC is picked as a baseline aircraft for the GAA design configuration: aircraft type, power plant, and performance to name a few.  Bonanza is one of the most popular General Aviation aircraft sold in recent years.  Bonanza's mission and performance characteristics are very close to the survey results obtained from AE8113 class report  (Huh, An et al. 1994) , . As a result, the aerospace engineering GAA design team decided to use it as a baseline model.  The AE student GAA design team also performed calculations for the GASP input data, for aerodynamics, engine performance, and stability control parameters, according to the mission profile.  In addition, some economic cost inputs were updated to 1995 prices.  Consequently, the input data is established for the baseline model.  An example of some of the data follows:

<UL>
<LI>Passengers: PAX = 3.0
<LI>Altitude: HNCRU = 7500 ft.
<LI>Range: ARNGE = 900 n.m.
<LI>Gross weight: WG = 3050 lb
<LI>Cruise speed: EMCRU = 0.31 Mach
<LI>Engine type: NTYE = 2 
<LI>Seats abreast: SAB = 2.0
<LI>Seat width: WS = 14.0 inches
<LI>Aspect ratio: AR = 9.24 
<LI>Propeller diameter: DPROP = 6.33 ft
<LI>Number of blades: BL = 2.0
<LI># flap segments/wing panel: FLAPN = 1.0
<LI>Time between overhaul: TBO = 2000.0 hrs
<LI>Cost of annual inspection: CINP = $1152
<LI>One engine overhaul cost OHR = $51
<LI>Increment to fixed annual cost: CMF = $1.0 
<LI>Fuel cost: FCSF = $1.99
<li>Manhour labor rate: ALR = $5.00/hr
</UL>

Once this baseline model is determined, it is time to determine the design variables and their ranges, the constraints on the design space, and the design goals.  Once this is done, the Compromise DSP can be created.<p>  

<A NAME="vcg"><H3>Variables, Constants, and Goals</H3></A>
In order create a Compromise DSP for the design of the General Aviation aircraft, six system design <B>variables</B> are identified.  They are as follows.<p>

<OL>
<LI>Cruise speed (0.26 &le; CSPD &le; to 0.36, nominal used is 0.36)
<LI>Aspect Ratio (2 &le; AR &le; 11, nominal used is 7)
<LI>Propeller diameter (4 &le; DPRP &le; 6.8 ft, nominal used is 6.8)
<LI>Wing loading (5 &le; WL &le; 25 lb/ft2, nominal used is 25)
<LI>Wing sweep angle (0 &le; SA &le; 3.5&degree;, nominal used is 0.)
<li>Engine activity factor (6 &le; AF &le; 85, nominal used is 85)
</OL>

In addition, five constraints are also identified to create a feasible design space for exploration.  These <B>constraints</B> are the following.<p>

<OL>
<LI>Take-off noise (NOISE &le; 75 dbA)
<LI>Tip speed (TPSPD &le; 650 ft/sec)
<LI>Direct operating cost (DOC &le; $60/hour)
<LI>Ride roughness coefficient (ROUGH < 1.8)
<li>Aircraft empty weight (WE &le; 2300 lbs)
</OL>

Finally, there are four <B>goals</B> to be achieved in the GAA design.  They are:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Minimize fuel weight (WFUEL &le; 500 lbs)
<LI>Minimize aircraft empty weight (WEMP &le; 2,000 lbs)
<LI>Minimize direct operating cost (DOC &le; $50/hour)
<li>Minimize aircraft purchasing cost (PURCH &le; $45,000/aircraft)
</OL>

<A NAME="form"><H2>The GAA Compromise DSP Formulation</H2></A>
<H3>Word Formulation</H3>
Helpful in developing the compromise DSP word formulation is making a pictoral representation of the C-DSP.  As such a representation of the C-DSP for the GAA project was developed, as seen in the following figure.

These are the answers to the <A HREF="LegQ.html">questions</A> on legislation.
<OL>
<LI>No, the main reason is the dwindling land space in (over) crowded Europe.  Raw material is of lesser (short term) importance.
<LI>Social, political, and cultural climate is different between US and Europe.  There is a big social and political push in Europe.  People are used to the idea of returning things for recycling and paying deposit money.  Also, there is still plenty of landspace in the US.
<LI>According to legislation, 80% of the plastics will have to be recycled in the year 2000.  Currently almost 100% of all plastic ends up as shredder residue on a landfill.
<LI>Export the cars to countries outside Europe.  Some persistent rumors exist which indicate that Japanese manufacturers are looking into the option of selling old cars to Russia.  Already, the second-hand car market in Western-Europe is depleted because of the Eastern-Europe demand for cheap vehicles.
<li>Economic and trade reasons.  Such legislation could form subtle trade-barriers for non-European manufacturers.  Such manufacturers either have to invest in building a take-back infrastructure in Europe, or take back their products to their home countries.  The latter is of course almost always impracticable.<p>

<LI>Approximately 75% because the ferrous and non-ferrous materials can already be seperated and recycled.
<li>This is extremely diffucult.  However, everybody can look at how much gas they consume during a week, multiplied by the car's life.  It is a start and will emphasize notions of uncertainty and lack of data.

<TITLE>Pre-Consumer Recycling</TITLE>

<P>
<H1>Pre-Consumer Recycling</H1>
<P>
<P>
Pre-Consumer Recycling is the recycling of material scrap generated during manufacturing processes.  As with Post-Consumer Recycling, the material can be recycled to produce a product with similar/identical properties (primary recycling), or as required be recycled into a product which degrades the properties of the material (secondary recycling).<P>
<P>
<B><U>Examples:</U></B>
<P>
During a sheet metal stamping operation, a part is stamped out of a piece of sheet metal.  The scrap material which is left over after the stamping operation can be recycled to make new rolls of sheet metal, which may be stamped once again.  Consequently, the consumer never sees or uses the material which is being recycled.
<P>
When producing thermoplastic injection molded parts, sprues, or runners, are cut into the molds to deliver the molten plastic from a central location in the mold to the (multiple) cavities in the mold where the parts are formed.  Once the plastic is molded, and the parts are removed from the mold, the runners rarely serve any purpose, and are removed.  These runners can be reground and mixed in a prescribed proportion with new plastic and be remolded without degrading the material properties of the plastic.<P>

<TITLE>Reuse</TITLE>

<H1>Reuse</H1>

The most dramatic reduction in environmental impact can be made by product reuse in which the geometrical form of the product is retained and the product is reused for the same purpose as during its original life-cycle (e.g., refillable drink bottles) or for secondary purposes (e.g., reuse of automotive tires as mooring cushions in a harbor).  With respect to <A HREF="MatRecyc.html">material recycling</A>, reuse has the following added benefits:<p>

<UL>
<LI>First, not only is the material waste and amount of landfill reduced, but also energy and matter consumption during manufacture are reduced because existing components are utilized.  This is emphasized by Navin-Chandra  <A HREF="References.html#4">[4]</A> :<p>
		"Every time a part is reused, all the energy and emissions that were
		produced in its manufacturing and the processing of its materials are
		salvaged".<p>
<li>Second, the utilization of existing components reduces an enterprise's monetary expenditure of producing or acquiring new components.  Well known examples are automotive components, industrial machinery, and military equipment  <A HREF="References.html#6">[6]</A>. 
</UL>

Additional savings in resources can be obtained by integrating the manufacturing, demanufacturing and remanufacturing processes  <A HREF="References.html#7">[7]</A> .  For instance, when disassembling a product, reusable components can be placed in a way which improves part-feed and eliminates a sorting process at the assembly stations.  Haynsworth and Lyons state that the reuse through refurbishing and remanufacturing of partly worn products provides large savings in resources   <A HREF="References.html#6">[6]</A> .  Pratt and Whitney remanufactures jet engines traded in by customers.  Remanufactured automobile parts such as engines, transmissions, alternators and starter engines account already for almost ten percent of the total production in Germany  <A HREF="References.html#5">[5]</A> .<p> 

It is interesting to note that in the U.S. a larger market and better developed infrastructure exists for component remanufacture than in Europe.  In case of recovering products for remanufacture and/or reuse, the following five processing stages are typically considered  <A HREF="References.html#5">[5]</A> ;<p>  
<OL>
<LI>disassembly,  
<LI>cleaning,  
<LI>inspection and sorting,  
<LI>part upgrading or part renewal, and 
<li>reassembly.
</OL><p>

Interestingly, according to VDI 2243 (which is a German national engineering standard developed by the German Professional Engineering Body), the major problem area in the disassembly of all products lies in the separation of joints.  For automobiles, these problems are aggravated by corrosion, dirt, and grease accumulated over the years.<p>

<TITLE>Material Recycling</TITLE>

<H1>Material Recycling</H1>


<H2>Recycling in Context</H2>

The term recycling is often used for all activities that lead a product, parts of a product, or the constituent material of a product into a new cycle of usage   <A HREF="References.html">[1-5]</A> .  Often a distinction is made between primary recycling, where the material is transformed into a product<TITLE></TITLE> on the same value-level as in the first cycle (e.g., glass from bottles which is transformed into bottles again), and secondary recycling where the material is reused for lower-value applications (e.g., plastic scrap as filling material).  It is easier to do secondary recycling than primary recycling.  For example, the polyurethane foam material in modern car seats can be recycled into residential carpet underlayers, but not into new seat foam again.  Similar, plastic bumper material can be made into construction filler.  However, this downgrading of material will cause problems and has people starting to wonder about the sustainability of recycling.<p>

Both in industry and academia, lots of attention is given to material recycling, in which the geometry of the product (and the associated value) is destroyed and only the constituent materials are led into a new cycle of usage.<p>

For material recycling, the following three processing stages are typically considered:<p> 
<OL>
<LI>material separation (disassembly),  
<LI>sorting, and
<li>reprocessing.
</OL><p>

Arguably, vehicle recycling became economically feasible with shredder technology.  Shredders reduce vehicles to small fragments which may be sorted magnetically into ferrous and non-ferrous materials.  The remainder is called "automotive shredder residue" or "fluff".  It accounts for almost a quarter of a shredded vehicle.  In Figure 3, a typical material break-down is given for a shredded vehicle.<p>

<H1>Energy Usage and Recovery</H1>
<IMG SRC="joebob.gif">
<A HREF="EnergyQ.html">Energy Questions</A><p>

It costs energy to manufacture products.  In Europe, incineration with energy recovery is also considered a form of recycling.  This is sometimes referred to as "energy recycling".  In addition, the volume of material to be landfilled is less after incineration than before.<p>


A quick way to assess the energy content of a product is to focus on its materials only.  By summing the energy contents of all materials in a product, the overall product energy content can be found.  The specific heat can often be used as a guideline for energy content.  In Table 2, the energy content of various materials are given.<p>

<H1>De Mosselaar</H1>

A Dutch company called De Mosselaar BV is experimenting with the process of assembly-line disassembly  <A HREF="References.html#12">[12]</A> .   In Figure 4, a schematic is given of their disassembly line.  In the attached pictures, one can see how a vehicle progresses through the line.  At stage 1, the fluids of a vehicle are drained and recovered.  At stages 2 and 3, the major interior and exterior body parts are recovered, respectively.  Next, the car is tilted and axles, exhaust, etc. are removed from the underside at stage 4.  At stage 5, the engine and transmission are pulled out of the car.  The remaining "hulk" is compacted at stage 6 and shipped to a body steel recycling facility.  Although De Mosselaar's line never really has been used at full speed, it is estimated that the line can process 125 to 200 cars in one work week, if it is manned with a highly experienced dismantling crew.<p>

<H2>Closing the Loop Answers</H2>
<hr>
These are the answers to the <A HREF="CLoopQ.html">questions</A> on Closing the Loop.
<OL>
<LI>Low energy and material consumption: lean manufacturing and weight minimization.  Use of environmentally benign materials: use recycled materials for components rather than virgin material.  Few and environmentally benign emissions: recycle production waste, avoid processes which create hazardous waste.  Low energy consumption: increase fuel efficiency.  Few emissions: use a catalytic converter.  Long life: make car more durable, design for serviceability.  Usefulness: make a car that will still be desirable after decades (e.g., Porsche 911 design).  Degradability: use biodegradable materials.  Rest speaks for itself.
<LI>The evolution is very analogous.  We are now at the same stage in disassembly lines as Henry Ford was when he started the assembly lines.  The next step will be automation, but gigantic problems with respect to flexibility and standardization have to be tackled first.
<li>The fluids account for another 5% of the total vehicle weight.  Recyclability would be up to 80% if the fluids could be recovered.  Also, most of the fluids are classified as hazardous materials.

<LI>The American Plastic Council publishes prices.  The "Green Times" was also in existence once and published prices on scrap materials.  The "Plastic News" magazine/journal also provides pricing info.
<LI>No.  It will cost approximately $23 to separate all materials.  In order to break even, about 10kg of copper at $2.20 per kg is needed.
<li>The prices continuously change.  Some prices in the table are completely outdated, for example, poly-urethane is recycled at the moment and good prices are paid.

<LI>Economic depression.  Germany is in a slump after the unification.  Buying power is low.
<LI>About 36 million X 1000kg = 36 million tons.  Given a length of 4 meters per car, the total line of cars to be dismantled would be 144,000 km, or about 90,000 miles.  This is more than 3 times around the equator!
<L1>Convert the annual production to production per work day.  It is assumed that there are 5 work days in a week and 52 weeks in a year.  This gives the following:   (36 million/52 weeks) X (5 days/ 7 days) = 500,000 cars are produced per day.  With 200 cars a week, 2500 lines would be needed world wide.

<CENTER><h1><IMG align=left SRC="gifs/buzz2.gif"><IMG align=right SRC="gifs/me4803a.gif"><br>Introduction To Automobile Recycling</h1></center>
<hr size=3>
<p>
A critical issue in sustainable technology is the preservation of resources.  In an industrial context, we can distinguish two broad categories of resources;  materials and energy.  One way to conserve resources is recycling.  This case highlights some of the ongoing issues and work in the recycling of automobiles.<p>
In Europe, automanufacturers have been asked to investigate the possibility of recycling their cars to avoid waste.  The dwindling landfill space in an overcrowded Europe has resulted in tough European legislation regarding the post-use stage of a product's life cycle (such as reuse/recycling).  There is also interest in the U.S.; the Big Three (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) have formed the Vehicle Recycling Partnership, which has been studying vehicle dismantling, and the American Automotive Manufacturers Association has come out with definitions regarding recycling. <p> 
<hr>
The main point of this case study is to fully explore the issue of recycling automobiles and everything that is involved, but its purpose is to get you to learn the basics behind recycling, and how to apply this knowledge to other products.<p>
<UL>
<LI>The first issue is the motivation behind recycling; in the case of automobiles, it is the recent legislation in Europe.
<LI>Secondly is the assessment of a product; how recyclable is it and what is its environmental impact?
<LI>Next is the issue of closing the product's life cycle loop, i.e., after the product has finished its useful life, how to "reincarnate" the product instead of landfilling it.  This can be done through reusing the product, recycling its materials, or extracting the energy stored in the product.
<LI>Following this is the economic feasability of recycling a product.  If money cannot be made by recycling it, how do we improve things to make recycling profitable?  What are the limiting factors?
<li>Finally, what is the future of the product, its production, etc., and what problems might be looming in the future?<p>
</UL>
These topics are all covered in this study, with a focus on the automobile.

<p>
The post-use stage of a product's life cycle is currently receiving a large amount of attention.  The motivation and growing interest in recycling of automobiles has primarily been created by legislation.<p>  

<H2>German Legislation</H2>

A major driving force is the so-called German take-back law.  This law has two aspects:<p>


<UL>
<LI>The proposed German "Take-Back Law" requires all automobile manufacturers to take back all vehicles which were ever sold in that country.  This program would start January 1, 1995.
<LI>In addition, proposed German law requires automobile manufacturers to meet recycling targets with components and materials from the dismantled vehicles.
</UL>


In Table 1, the recycling target levels are given for the German proposal.  Note the increases in certain areas.  In particular, the recycling targets for <B>plastics</B> will be raised from 20 % in 1996 to 80 % in the year 2000.<p>  

<H3>Table 1: Reuse and Material Recycling Targets in % by weight

</Table></center>
          
 <p>
The German law was supposed to go in effect on January 1, 1995.  However, upcoming elections have caused delays in implementing the law.<p>
<hr>
<h2>European Legislation</h2>

The European Commission is also working on similar take back legislation.  The specific objectives are:<p>
<ul>
<li>avoidance of waste,
<li>reduction of landfill demand, and
<li>reduction of toxicity
</ul>
In addition, the following limits are set on the maximum allowable percentage of a car that can be landfilled:<p> 
<ul>
<li>Beginning in 2002, a maximum of 15% of car weight can be landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery.
<li>For new models beginning in 2002, a maximum of 10% of car weight can be disposed.
<li>A maximum of 5% of car weight disposal in 2015.
</ul>

These "threats" have caused car manufacturers to cooperate rather than to compete.  The following are some examples of efforts being undertaken.<p>
<ul>
<li>Under pressure by their European governments, European car manufacturers have already invested large efforts in studying the recyclability of their products.  Their primary focus is on recovering large volumes of plastics  <A HREF="References.html">[1, 2, 8-11]</A> .  Weber provides a good overview on the efforts of the German auto-industry with respect to plastic recycling  <A HREF="References.html#9">[9]</A> .  Weber lists some studies which have been performed by Volkswagen with respect to the man-hours required to disassemble certain car parts to be recycled.
<li>Several international initiatives are also underway in Europe.  Eurekar, one such initiative, consists of a number of non-German European car manufacturers and the Chrysler Corporation.  
<li>In the U.S., the Big Three (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) have formed the Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP).  The VRP has established a Vehicle Dismantling Center in Detroit where automotive dismantling studies are being performed.
<li>In order to standardize the terms, the American Automotive Manufacturers Association has come out with definitions regarding recycling.
</ul>

<hr>
<OL>
<LI>No, the main reason is the dwindling land space in (over) crowded Europe.  Raw material is of lesser (short term) importance.
<LI>Social, political, and cultural climate is different between US and Europe.  There is a big social and political push in Europe.  People are used to the idea of returning things for recycling and paying deposit money.  Also, there is still plenty of landspace in the US.
<LI>According to legislation, 80% of the plastics will have to be recycled in the year 2000.  Currently almost 100% of all plastic ends up as shredder residue on a landfill.
<LI>Export the cars to countries outside Europe.  Some persistent rumors exist which indicate that Japanese manufacturers are looking into the option of selling old cars to Russia.  Already, the second-hand car market in Western-Europe is depleted because of the Eastern-Europe demand for cheap vehicles.
<li>Economic and trade reasons.  Such legislation could form subtle trade-barriers for non-European manufacturers.  Such manufacturers either have to invest in building a take-back infrastructure in Europe, or take back their products to their home countries.  The latter is of course almost always impracticable.<p>

<h2>Recyclability of a Product</h2>  

A critical issue is the assessment of recyclability.  A uniform calculation is needed in conjunction with the German and European legislation.  In order to assist in "measuring" recyclability, the VRP is defining the following five categories of recycling:<p>

Category :<p>

<ol>
<li><B>Recyclable - infrastructure and technology clearly defined</B>.
-	Part is completely recyclable (or reusable), infrastructure clearly defined and functioning (e.g., body sheet metal, engine blocks).
<li><B>Potentially recyclable, but no infrastructure is available.</B>
-	Collection network not defined or organized (e.g., plastic interior trim).
<li><B>Potentially recyclable, but process or material development is required</B>.
-	Technology has not been commercialized (e.g., glass-fiber recycling).
<li><B>Energy recovery potential.</B>
-	Known technology/capacity to produce energy with economic value (e.g., pyrolysis of tires).
<li><B>No potential for recycling known.</B>
-	Recyclability technology not known (e.g., leather trim).
</ol>

The work is still ongoing and the categories are not finalized yet.  Using these categories, a vehicle's recyclability can be calculated.  Currently, a vehicle's recyclability is calculated as follows.<p>  
<ul>
<li>First, the weight of all the components of a car which are "category 1" recyclable is summed.
<li>Next, this weight is divided by the total weight of the vehicle and the resulting number indicates the fraction recyclability of a vehicle.
</ul>

This calculation can be done for any product.  The advantage is that the calculation is relatively simple.  The disadvantage is that it only focuses on category 1;  all other categories are excluded from the assessment.<p>
Another way in which products can be assessed is through a Life Cycle Assessment.<p>
<hr>
<h2>Environmental Impact - Life Cycle Analysis</h2>

Some people argue that environmental friendliness should be measured in units of energy.  The less energy it costs to make a product, the better it is.  This notion has led to so-called Life Cycle Analysis/Assessment (LCA) approaches.  Life cycle analysis (or assessment) is a method in which the energy and raw material consumption, different types of emissions and other important factors related to a specific product are being measured, analyzed and summoned over the products entire life cycle, from an environmental point of view.  The EPA has some good reports on LCA.  They form the most comprehensive tools to be used to support green engineering.  Good overviews on LCAs are given in  <A HREF="References.html#14">[14-17]</A> .  The strength of LCA is the (potential) broadness of scope and depth of evaluation.  However, this strength is also its major weakness at the moment.  Designers find it almost impossible to practically work with LCAs, because the LCA tools have a tendency to be as complex as the issue under investigation.  Recognized problems with LCAs are the consistent lack of solid data about all aspects of a products life cycle, the nearly infinite amount of decisions to be made, the lack of standardization resulting in numerous conversions, and the lack of a standard evaluation scheme caused by and resulting in different views on what is right <A HREF="References.html#16">[16]</A>.

When people talk about "recycling", they often refer to post-use recycling, that is, the recycling of a product (or material) after it has been used by a consumer.  It is important to note that recycling is not the only aspect which makes a product sustainable or environmentally benign.  In Figure 1, a number of additional aspects are given.<p>

<center><IMG ALIGN=top SRC="Figures/Fig1.GIF"></center><p>
<B>Figure 1 - Aspects of an Environmentally Benign and Sustainable Product</B><p>
<A NAME="Pre"><hr></A>

As is already highlighted in Figure 1, recycling can occur at different stages during a product's life-cycle.  Some organizations use the term <A HREF="PreConsumer.html">"pre-consumer recycling"</A> to characterize the recycling of waste that occurs during the manufacture of a product.  In Figure 2, a diagram of a system's life cycle is given, illustrating the different life-cycle stages.  The phrase "Cradle to Reincarnation" emphasizes the fact that products can be reincarnated into new (either higher or lower valued) products through recycling.  The phrase has evolved from the term "Design from Cradle to Grave" which emphasized the fact that one should think about what happens to a product / system once it has fulfilled its useful life.<p> 

<center><IMG SRC="Figures/Fig2.GIF"></center><p>
<B>Figure 2 - A System's Life-Cycle from Cradle-to-Reincarnation</B><p>

The term "demanufacture" is appearing more and more in the literature, especially in the electronics industry, to characterize the process opposite to manufacturing involved in recycling materials and products after a product has been taken back by a company.

These are the answers to the questions on Closing the Loop.
<hr>
<OL>
<LI>Low energy and material consumption: lean manufacturing and weight minimization.  Use of environmentally benign materials: use recycled materials for components rather than virgin material.  Few and environmentally benign emissions: recycle production waste, avoid processes which create hazardous waste.  Low energy consumption: increase fuel efficiency.  Few emissions: use a catalytic converter.  Long life: make car more durable, design for serviceability.  Usefulness: make a car that will still be desirable after decades (e.g., Porsche 911 design).  Degradability: use biodegradable materials.  Rest speaks for itself.
<LI>The evolution is very analogous.  We are now at the same stage in disassembly lines as Henry Ford was when he started the assembly lines.  The next step will be automation, but gigantic problems with respect to flexibility and standardization have to be tackled first.
<li>The fluids account for another 5% of the total vehicle weight.  Recyclability would be up to 80% if the fluids could be recovered.  Also, most of the fluids are classified as hazardous materials.

There are various strategies, or processess, that can be taken during the dismantling and recycling of a product.  The priorities of these, in the context of the take-back of products, are as follows:<p>

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="Reuse.html">Reuse </A><A NAME="index1">(product recycling)</A>
<UL>
<LI>This has the highest priority from environmental point of view, because all resources (material and energy) put into product during manufacturing are preserved.  This often provides economic advantages as well.
<li>A "negative" aspect is that reuse requires non-destructive disassembly and additional inspection operations which increase the cost.
</UL>
<LI><A HREF="MatRecyc.html">Material recycling</A>
<UL>
<LI>This is the most common process.
<LI>Only the materials are preserved, all geometric details are lost.
<LI>It allows for (cheap) destructive disassembly.

<hr size=3>

The most dramatic reduction in environmental impact can be made by product reuse in which the geometrical form of the product is retained and the product is reused for the same purpose as during its original life-cycle (e.g., refillable drink bottles) or for secondary purposes (e.g., reuse of automotive tires as mooring cushions in a harbor).  With respect to <A HREF="MatRecyc.html">material recycling</A>, reuse has the following added benefits:<p>

<UL>
<LI>First, not only is the material waste and amount of landfill reduced, but also energy and matter consumption during manufacture are reduced because existing components are utilized.  This is emphasized by Navin-Chandra  <A HREF="References.html#4">[4]</A> :<p>
		"Every time a part is reused, all the energy and emissions that were
		produced in its manufacturing and the processing of its materials are
		salvaged".<p>
<li>Second, the utilization of existing components reduces an enterprise's monetary expenditure of producing or acquiring new components.  Well known examples are automotive components, industrial machinery, and military equipment  <A HREF="References.html#6">[6]</A>. 
</UL>

Additional savings in resources can be obtained by integrating the manufacturing, demanufacturing and remanufacturing processes  <A HREF="References.html#7">[7]</A> .  For instance, when disassembling a product, reusable components can be placed in a way which improves part-feed and eliminates a sorting process at the assembly stations.  Haynsworth and Lyons state that the reuse through refurbishing and remanufacturing of partly worn products provides large savings in resources   <A HREF="References.html#6">[6]</A> .  Pratt and Whitney remanufactures jet engines traded in by customers.  Remanufactured automobile parts such as engines, transmissions, alternators and starter engines account already for almost ten percent of the total production in Germany  <A HREF="References.html#5">[5]</A> .<p> 

It is interesting to note that in the U.S. a larger market and better developed infrastructure exists for component remanufacture than in Europe.  In case of recovering products for remanufacture and/or reuse, the following five processing stages are typically considered  <A HREF="References.html#5">[5]</A> ;<p>  
<OL>
<LI>disassembly,  
<LI>cleaning,  
<LI>inspection and sorting,  
<LI>part upgrading or part renewal, and 
<li>reassembly.
</OL>
<p>
Interestingly, according to VDI 2243 (which is a German national engineering standard developed by the German Professional Engineering Body), the major problem area in the disassembly of all products lies in the separation of joints.  For automobiles, these problems are aggravated by corrosion, dirt, and grease accumulated over the years.

<H2>Recycling in Context</H2>

The term recycling is often used for all activities that lead a product, parts of a product, or the constituent material of a product into a new cycle of usage   <A HREF="References.html">[1-5]</A> .  Often a distinction is made between primary recycling, where the material is transformed into a product<TITLE></TITLE> on the same value-level as in the first cycle (e.g., glass from bottles which is transformed into bottles again), and secondary recycling where the material is reused for lower-value applications (e.g., plastic scrap as filling material).  It is easier to do secondary recycling than primary recycling.  For example, the polyurethane foam material in modern car seats can be recycled into residential carpet underlayers, but not into new seat foam again.  Similar, plastic bumper material can be made into construction filler.  However, this downgrading of material will cause problems and has people starting to wonder about the sustainability of recycling.<p>

Both in industry and academia, lots of attention is given to material recycling, in which the geometry of the product (and the associated value) is destroyed and only the constituent materials are led into a new cycle of usage.<p>

For material recycling, the following three processing stages are typically considered:<p> 
<OL>
<LI>material separation (disassembly),  
<LI>sorting, and
<li>reprocessing.
</OL><p>

Arguably, vehicle recycling became economically feasible with shredder technology.  Shredders reduce vehicles to small fragments which may be sorted magnetically into ferrous and non-ferrous materials.  The remainder is called "automotive shredder residue" or "fluff".  It accounts for almost a quarter of a shredded vehicle.  In Figure 3, a typical material break-down is given for a shredded vehicle.<p>

It costs energy to manufacture products.  In Europe, incineration with energy recovery is also considered a form of recycling.  This is sometimes referred to as "energy recycling".  In addition, the volume of material to be landfilled is less after incineration than before.<p>


A quick way to assess the energy content of a product is to focus on its materials only.  By summing the energy contents of all materials in a product, the overall product energy content can be found.  The specific heat can often be used as a guideline for energy content.  In Table 2, the energy content of various materials are given.<p>

<hr>
After reading the page on energy use and recovery, you should be able to answer the following questions.  The answers are linked to the bottom of the page.
<hr>
<OL>
<LI>Given the breakdown of materials in Table 2 on the energy page, make a rough estimate of the energy content of an automobile. (Hint: also use Table 3 on the economics page)
<li>Could a 95% or even a 100% energy recovery level be achieved, like postulated in the material recycling legislation?

These are the answers to the questions on energy use and recovery.
<hr>
<OL>
<LI>Take the materials in Table 3 and multiply the weight times the (average) energy content of the material.  In case it is not listed in Table 2 (e.g., poly-urethane), make an appropriate estimate.  This lack of data should be highlighted to point out the amount of work which still needs to be done.
<li>Given the laws of thermodynamics, it will be unlikely that such a high level of recovery can be found.  It means that we almost need to have a fully reversible process.

A Dutch company called De Mosselaar BV is experimenting with the process of assembly-line disassembly  <A HREF="References.html#12">[12]</A> .   In Figure 4, a schematic is given of their disassembly line.  In the attached pictures, one can see how a vehicle progresses through the line.  At stage 1, the fluids of a vehicle are drained and recovered.  At stages 2 and 3, the major interior and exterior body parts are recovered, respectively.  Next, the car is tilted and axles, exhaust, etc. are removed from the underside at stage 4.  At stage 5, the engine and transmission are pulled out of the car.  The remaining "hulk" is compacted at stage 6 and shipped to a body steel recycling facility.  Although De Mosselaar's line never really has been used at full speed, it is estimated that the line can process 125 to 200 cars in one work week, if it is manned with a highly experienced dismantling crew.

<p>
Economics form a major concern.  In fact, many European car manufacturers have throttled down on their efforts to create "green" cars because they started to realize that there are economic trade-offs.  Automobile take-back, dismantling, and recycling can have large associated costs.  Some common cost factors are:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Buy back of car ($/car).  Typically, this is dependent on condition and value of car type.  In some cases, there may not be a buy back cost.
<LI>Transportation costs ($/km).  These costs may also depend on weight and amount of damage tolerated.  Consider the difference in gas prices between Europe and the U.S.A.
<LI>Tip and storage fees ($/car).  You typically have to pay dumping material on a landfill.  The property on which cars are stored also costs money.  These costs are strongly influenced by location of the recycling facility and local legislation.
<LI>Labor cost ($/hour).  This speaks for itself.  However, labor costs also depend on the level of skills required.
<LI>Equipment investment cost ($) and operating cost ($/car, $/hr).  Influenced by the need for special (expensive) equipment and the depreciation rate of the equipment.
<li>Time necessary to recover parts and materials (hr/car).  This is strongly influenced by the design of the vehicle
</UL>.

In order to obtain a profit, these costs have to be offset by revenues.  Revenues in automobile recycling are obtained from:<p>

<UL>
<LI>High value (high demand), undamaged recovered reusable components.  Additional processing (cleaning, inspection, upgrading, reassembly, and redistribution) adds to costs.
<LI>High value, uncontaminated scrap materials.  Any contamination which reduces material properties depreciates the material value.
<li>Energy recovered and sold from incineration or pyrolysis.  This has the lowest revenue of all.
</UL>

In the article "Modeling the cost of plastic recycling" <A HREF="References.html#13"> [13]</A> , a Technical Cost Model approach is given which highlights the factors involved in recycling automobiles.  It also includes a table of material scrap prices given below.<p>

In the article "Activity-Based Costing in Design for Product Retirement" an overview of current costing approaches is given, as well as a simple <A HREF="ABC.html">Activity-Based Costing (ABC) model</A> for assessing the cost of product retirement.  The model has been implemented on a spreadsheet.  By changing the amount of material to be recovered by dismantling and shredding, dismantling times, landfill and transportation fees, different profitabilities can be obtained.  The model is simple, but realistic.  It can be used in a number of exercises related around the issue of economical and ecological tradeoffs.

<LI>The American Plastic Council publishes prices.  The "Green Times" was also in existence once and published prices on scrap materials.  The "Plastic News" magazine/journal also provides pricing info.
<LI>No.  It will cost approximately $23 to separate all materials.  In order to break even, about 10kg of copper at $2.20 per kg is needed.
<li>The prices continuously change.  Some prices in the table are completely outdated, for example, poly-urethane is recycled at the moment and good prices are paid.

<H2>Future Automobile Waste</H2>
<P>
One of the major problems facing recycling is the uncertainties of the future.  Looking back over the past, we can see that vehicle production in the United States as well as in the entire world (Figures 5 and 6 respectively) have continued to rise since around the 1950s.  When you consider that the upward trend of automotive production has not yet shown significant signs of leveling off, it becomes obvious that the disposal needs will also continue to grow.  The typical life expectancy of a complex product like an automobile ranges from 10 to 15 years.  In other words we are currently attempting to dispose of vehicles produced in the early 1980's timeframe.<p>

<H2>Design Challenges</H2><P>
<P>
The most effective method to reduce the amount of material from automobiles which will end up in a landfill is to change the way in which automobiles are designed.  Vehicles need to be designed such that removal of reusable components is made easier, materials which are to be recycled are easier to remove and sort into base material components, and the amount of materials which are difficult to recycle are reduced.<P>
<P>
On the other side of the coin, any design changes which are made today will not cause an immediate change for 10 to 15 years.  Therefore the immediate challenge is to find more economically feasible methods - which are still ecologically sound - to recycle existing vehicles, and reduce the amount of vehicles and vehicular components landfilled annually.

<LI>Economic depression.  Germany is in a slump after the unification.  Buying power is low.
<LI>About 36 million X 1000kg = 36 million tons.  Given a length of 4 meters per car, the total line of cars to be dismantled would be 144,000 km, or about 90,000 miles.  This is more than 3 times around the equator!
<L1>Convert the annual production to production per work day.  It is assumed that there are 5 work days in a week and 52 weeks in a year.  This gives the following:   (36 million/52 weeks) X (5 days/ 7 days) = 500,000 cars are produced per day.  With 200 cars a week, 2500 lines would be needed world wide.

Because the car manufacturers in Europe are having to deal with the take-back legislation, a number of them are looking to contract third party dismantlers, such as <A HREF="DeMoss.html">De Mosselaar</A>, for taking back automobiles.  <A HREF="MBenz.html">Mercedes-Benz</A> and Volkswagen, on the other hand, are taking back their own vehicles and dismantling them in their respective plants, rather than using third party people. Volkswagen recovers its parts and then sells them through its own dealer network.  Mercedes also recovers its parts and resells them, but it also goes the additional step of recycling the materials from the non-salable components of the vehicles.  Interestingly, in the United States, anti-trust and monopoly laws largely prohibit GM, Ford, and Chrysler to join hands and control an economically feasible dismantling infrastructure in the US.  In Europe, car manufacturers are allowed to do this, or it is often condoned by the governments.<p>

<center><H1>General Compromise DSP Information</H1></center>
<hr size=2 width=400 align=center>
<p>
The information on this page focuses on answering the following two questions:<br>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#what">What Is The Compromise DSP?</A>
<li><A HREF="#how">How Does A Compromise DSP Differ From Other Optimization Formulations?</A>
</UL>
<hr>
<p>
<A NAME="what"><font size=4><b>What Is The Compromise DSP?</b></font></A>
<p>
The compromise DSP is a multiobjective decision model which is considered to be a hybrid formulation (Mistree, Hughes et al. 1993).  It incorporates concepts from both traditional Mathematical Programming and Goal Programming.  The compromise DSP is concerned with determining the values of design variables to satisfy a set of constraints and to achieve as closely as possible a set of conflicting goals.  An important aspect of designing engineering systems is the modeling and handling of multiple trade-offs simultaneously.  The compromise DSP is used to model such decisions.  The compromise DSP is stated with the following key words and their descriptions:<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Given</b>
<dd>
<UL>
<LI>An alternative that is to be improved through modification.<br>
<LI>Assumptions used to model the domain of interest.<br>
<LI>The system parameters.<br>
<li>The goals for the design.<p>
</UL>

<dt><b>Find</b>
<dd>
<UL>
<LI>The values of the independent system variables (they describe the attributes of an artifact).<br>
<li>The values of the deviation variables (they indicate the extent to which the goals are achieved).<p>
</UL>

<dt><b>Satisfy</b>
<dd>
<UL>
<LI>The system constraints that must be satisfied for the solution to be feasible.<br>
<LI>The system goals that must achieve a specified target value as much as possible.<br>
<li>The lower and upper bounds on the system variables.<p>
</UL>

<dt><b>Minimize</b>
<dd>
<UL>
<li>The deviation function which is a measure of the deviation of the system performance from that implied by the set of goals and their associated priority levels or relative weights.<p>
</UL>
</dl>
The difference between the compromise DSP and the traditional single objective formulation for a two dimensional problem is illustrated in Figure 1.  In the case of the single objective formulation, shown in Figure 1a, the objective is a function of the system variables.  The space representing all feasible solutions (the feasible design space) is surrounded by the system constraints and bounds of the problem.  The objective is to maximize the value of Z and hence, as shown in the figure, the solution will be at vertex A.
<p>
<!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG width=100% SRC="fig1.gif">
<CENTER><B>Figure 1 - A Single Objective Optimization Problem and the Multigoal Compromise Decision Support Problem</B></CENTER>
<p>
In the compromise formulation, the set of system constraints and bounds again define the feasible design space, whereas the set of system goals define the aspiration space (see Figure 2b).  For feasibility the system constraints and bounds must again be satisfied whereas the system goals are to be achieved to the extent possible.  The solution to this problem represents a trade-off between that which is desired (as modeled by the aspiration space) and that which can be achieved (as modeled by the design space).
<p> 
The solution for the compromise DSP shown in Figure 1b is at vertex A.  This is the same solution as that obtained for the problem illustrated in Figure 1a.  The difference is that in the compromise case with the aspiration space modeled, the best possible solution can be identified.  Given a solution, it is left to a designer to accept this solution or to explore the problem further by modifying the aspirations and/or the feasible design space and re-solving.  The values of the deviation variables provide a measure in assessing the degree by which each of the goals have not been achieved and are a source of some very useful information.   In the early stages of design many issues are still open or will change over time.  Therefore, it is important to maintain maximum design freedom as long as possible and the compromise DSP allows us to realize this extension of design freedom.

<font size=4><b><A NAME="how">How Does A Compromise DSP Differ From Other Optimization Formulations?</A></b></font><br>
(Goal Programming Model And the Traditional Single-Objective Model)
<p>
As shown in Table 1, the Compromise DSP model can handle constraints, goals, and multiple objectives better than goal programming or traditional single-objective optimization.
<p>

<TABLE border>
<TR><TD>The Baseline Model</TD><TD>Goal Programming Model</TD><TD>The Compromise DSP Model</TD><TD>Traditional Single-Objective Model</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>constraints<br>goals<br>objectives</TD><TD><br>goals<br>objectives</TD><TD>constraints<br>goals<br>objectives</TD><TD>constraints<br><br>objectives</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<B><CENTER>Table 1 - Model Comparison</CENTER></B>
<p>
The Compromise DSP offers the following:

<UL>
<LI>Capability to accurately represent single-objective or multi-objectives  
<LI>Option of using Preemptive or Archimedean formulation to prioritize
<LI>To decide between making a constraint soft (a goal) and hard
<LI>Capability to more frequently generate feasible solutions  
<li>Quick generation of results for several different schemes
</UL>
<p>
There is more that the compromise DSP has to offer, but just looking at the preceding information enables one to make a lot of conclusions.  First of all, the compromise DSP is capable of doing everything that traditional optimization can do and more!  Traditional single-objective optimization is underneath the compromise DSP umbrella.  Basically, the Compromise DSP is more open than the other "optimization methods"; with the capability to switch constraints from hard to soft, the capability to model more than one objective, and the capability to use Preemptive or Archimedean formulation, the compromise DSP offers several different models from which the designer can choose.

<A NAME="prob"><font size=4><b>How Do You Write The Problem Statement?</b></font></A>
<p>
The problem statement is a written description of the problem.  Do you remember the following list, the C-DSP key words and descriptors?  Well, the problem statement must provide a basis for identifying and developing all of the system descriptors for the C-DSP.  The system variables need to be clearly defined and the basis for the system constraints and goals should be clearly explained.  Every goal has two deviation variables associated with it and they need to be specified to obtain a solution.  The system variables are always positive and nonzero.

<A NAME="word"><font size=4><b>How Do You Develop The Word Formulation From A Problem Statement?</b></font></A>
<p>
The word formulation of the compromise DSP is based on the information that is provided in the problem statement.  This is different from the problem statement in that the problem statement is unstructured (no key words), whereas the word problem is structured in terms of the key words Given, Find, Satisfy, Minimize (see above).  The C-DSP includes both system and deviation variables, system constraints and goals.  The objective or deviation function for the compromise DSP is written in terms of the deviation variables only.
<p> 
<hr>
<A NAME="math"><font size=4><b>How Is The Mathematical Formulation Developed From The Word Formulation?</b></font></A>
<p>
The system descriptors, namely, system and deviation variables, system constraints, system goals, bounds and the deviation function are described in detail elsewhere (for example, (Lyon and Mistree 1985; Mistree, Marinopoulos et al. 1988)) and will not be repeated here.  The mathematical form of the compromise DSP is summarized below.  In the compromise DSP formulation, each goal, Ai, has two associated deviation variables di- and di+ which indicate the extent of the deviation from the target.  The product constraint di+ . di- = 0 ensures that at least one of the deviation variables for a particular goal will always be zero.  If the problem is solved using a vertex solution scheme (as in the ALP-algorithm (Mistree, Hughes et al. 1993)), then this condition is automatically satisfied.  
<p>
<pre>
Given
	An alternative to be improved through modification.
	Assumptions used to model the domain of interest.
	The system parameters:
		n  		number of system variables
		p+q 		number of system constraints
		p		equality constraints
		q		inequality constraints
		m		number of system goals
	gi(X) 	system constraint function:
			gi(X)   =  Ci(X)   Di(X) 
	fk(di )	function of deviation variables to be minimized at priority level k 
		for the preemptive case.
Find
		Xi 					i  =  1,..., n
		d-i , d+i 				i  =  1, ..., m
Satisfy
	System constraints (linear, nonlinear)
		gi(X)  =  0 ;				i  =  1, ..., p
		gi(X)    0 ;				i  =  p+1, ..., p+q
	System goals (linear, nonlinear)
		Ai(X)  +  d-i     d+i   =  Gi ; 	i  =  1, ..., m
	Bounds
	Ximin    Xi    Ximax ;	 		i =  1, ..., n
		d-i  , d+i     0 ;			i  =  1, ..., m
		( d-i  . d+i   =  0 ;			i  =  1, ..., m )
Minimize
	Preemptive deviation function (lexicographic minimum)
		Z  =  [ f1( d-i , d+i ), ..., fk( d-i , d+i ) ]
</pre>
<p>
Usually, goals are not equally important.  To effect a solution, on the basis of preference, the goals may be rank-ordered into priority levels.  Customers rate certain product qualities higher than other qualities.  We should seek a solution which minimizes all unwanted deviations from the desired qualities.  There are various methods of measuring the effectiveness of the minimization of these unwanted deviations.  We apply the lexicographic minimum concept.  The lexicographic minimum is defined as (Ignizio 1985).
<p>
<pre>
LEXICOGRAPHIC MINIMUM  Given an ordered array f = (f1, f2, ... , fn) of
nonnegative elements fk's, the solution given by f(1) is preferred to f(2) if 

	fk(1) < fk(2)

and fi(1) < fi(2) for i = 1, ... , k-1;  that is all higher-order elements are equal.  If no other
solution is preferred to f, then f is the lexicographic minimum.
</pre>
<p>
The lexicographic minimum concept is appropriate for use in the early stages of design where no detailed information is available concerning the weights of the goals.  Different quality scenarios can quickly be evaluated by changing the priority levels of the goals to be achieved.

These are the answers to the <A HREF="EnergyQ.html">questions</A> on energy use and recovery.
<OL>
<LI>Take the materials in Table 3 and multiply the weight times the (average) energy content of the material.  In case it is not listed in Table 2 (e.g., poly-urethane), make an appropriate estimate.  This lack of data should be highlighted to point out the amount of work which still needs to be done.
<li>Given the laws of thermodynamics, it will be unlikely that such a high level of recovery can be found.  It means that we almost need to have a fully reversible process.

<body>
<center><H2>Pre-Consumer Recycling</H2></center>
<hr>

Pre-Consumer Recycling is the recycling of material scrap generated during manufacturing processes.  As with Post-Consumer Recycling, the material can be recycled to produce a product with similar/identical properties (primary recycling), or as required be recycled into a product which degrades the properties of the material (secondary recycling).
<P>
<B><U>Examples:</U></B>
<UL>
<LI>During a sheet metal stamping operation, a part is stamped out of a piece of sheet metal.  The scrap material which is left over after the stamping operation can be recycled to make new rolls of sheet metal, which may be stamped once again.  Consequently, the consumer never sees or uses the material which is being recycled.
<P>
<li>When producing thermoplastic injection molded parts, sprues, or runners, are cut into the molds to deliver the molten plastic from a central location in the mold to the (multiple) cavities in the mold where the parts are formed.  Once the plastic is molded, and the parts are removed from the mold, the runners rarely serve any purpose, and are removed.  These runners can be reground and mixed in a prescribed proportion with new plastic and be remolded without degrading the material properties of the plastic.

<H2>Experience Summary</H2>
He served as the principal investigator for a NASA Phase I SBIR contract to develop a Universal 6-DOF Joystick for use on the Space Station.  Besides his role in project management, he had a significant role in the development of a generic mapping algorithm that would allow this device to command the position of any robotic device in several different modes.  Additional work included the design of the mechanical structure, development of a control algorithm for force feedback to human operator, and the design of an intuitive user interface.
<p>
He has also been involved in the development of robotic systems for the manufacturing environment.  One project involved the optimization of pick and place robotic operations using a conveyor line.  Current industrial practice is to use a SCARA type robot due to its improved cycle times as compared to other types of robots.  Research focused on methods to improve the cycle time of a robot loading parts from a moving conveyor line at a fixed pace and placing them in a set of constant basket positions.
<p>
Other work involves the development of computer controlled fingers for the grasping of deformable bodies.  The work has focused on both the analytical and experimental development of simple, but rugged fingers for applications in non-traditional manufacturing environments.  This type of research is of interest to industries such as the poultry industry where the product to be handled is not rigid and geometrically consistent as those found in the electronics or mechanical assembly field.  For this type of system, traditional finger and hand designs were studied to evaluate their performance and their susceptibility to environmental deterioration. 
<p>
Current work has been on the development of Human Level Performance Robots.  These robots are characterized by a set performance specifications similar to that of a human.  This includes the speed of the robot, its accuracy, and its cost.  Work during the previous year has concentrated on the demonstration of several key elements of the first human level performance robot, the Integrated Intelligent Belt Manipulator (IIBM).  This robot was designed to grasp the raw poultry product as it moved down a conveyor system  and then place it in a predefined position and orientation that simulated that of a tray pack.  This work demonstrated the effectiveness of the grasping system, the speed and reliability of the robot and its controller, and the ability to cost-effectively detect the position and orientation of the product as it moved along the conveyor.
<p>
Other research has focused on the development of visual servoing for robotic manipulators.  Current robotic technology relies on precise joint movement and careful calibration to accurately position the end effector. Visual servoing eliminates these requirements by providing a robot with the equivalent of human hand-eye coordination. This endows the robot with the ability to view the world around it and adjust its position and orientation accordingly.  In an industrial setting, this allows the robot to locate and grasp objects whose position has not been previousily predefined.This is accomplished by processing image feature input and translating it directly into motion commands for the robot.  Our research focuses on developing visual servoing methods without the need for a precise joint feedback system or kinematic model.  Eliminating these stringent mechanical requirements allows for the production of inexpensively manufactured robots.  The goal is to develop flexible and inexpensive robotic systems.

<title>Second-Generation Wearable Computer(EPSS)</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Second-Generation Wearable Computer</h1>
<br>
<p>
In June, 1996, we repackaged the components into the second generation of our wearable computer.  We wanted to move the computer unit out of the user's way and we wanted to use a better cursor positioning and selection device.  So we moved the computer unit from the front to the back of the user and we replaced the hard shell case with a soft, water-resistant fanny pack.  To protect the wearable computer components, we lined the fanny back with one inch of foam.  We also replaced the backup cursor positioning and selection device with an easy-to-use touch pad.  Figure 1 is a front view of our second-generation wearable computer.  To make the figure bigger, click on it.  Notice the computer display that appears in front of the user's right eye.

</H3><P>Thanks for visiting!  I am a mechanical engineering graduate student at Georgia Tech, which means I am currently living in Atlanta, but I moved here from Alabama, am from Arkansas, have lived in Tennessee, and have parents that are about to move to Missouri.  I like music (a wide variety), computers, and--don't laugh--muppets.  A<B> huge</B> part of my life is my fiance, Jodie Jones, who, incidentally, is the most wonderful person in the known universe.  We recently got engaged and will be married next June.  I would tell you more, but I think I've embarrassed her enough.  Let's see, what else...I am very active in the Church, and I have a very sweet bassett hound named Sherlock.  And I have a brother, Kevin, who owns the most comic books in Northeast Arkansas.  <p>

<title>First-Generation Wearable Computer(EPSS)</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>First-Generation Wearable Computer</h1>
<br>
<p>
The first generation of the FAST delivery system included the following  components:
<ul>
<li>A compact computer (about the size of a portable cassette player) that the worker wears on a belt.  Combined with our multimedia EPSS and a wireless local area network, the computer allows the user to enter and receive information wherever
the user goes.
<li>A small microphone and earphone device (resembling a high-tech telephone operator's headset) that allows the system to accept voice commands and to provide audio information while keeping the user's hands free for other tasks.
<li>A trackball/pointer device that can be adjusted easily for right- or left-handed users.  The cursor positioning and selection device serves as a backup for the voice input system.
<li>A pair of goggles with a tiny computer screen that does not block the worker's vision.  The small display allows the user to continue to work while looking at text, drawings,
and videos.
</ul>

Our first-generation wearable computer was a 486-33 MHz processor with eight MB of RAM and an 810 MB hard drive.  Without batteries, the first-generation prototype wearable computer (computer unit, wireless LAN antenna, head-mounted display, and earphone/microphone unit) weighed 1.4 kg (3.2 pounds).  The battery belt weighed 2.5 kg (5.7 pounds).  The computer unit alone (shown in blue) weighed 0.9 kg (1.9 pounds).  The total weight of our first-generation wearable computer, with battery belt, was 3.9 kg (8.9 pounds).

(Assessment is different from evaluation in that assessment is focused on estimating student learning whereas evaluation is focused on the effectiveness and worth of programs or products.)  2.	List your objectives on the vertical side of the matrix.3.	List the feasible assessment methods on the horizontal side of the matrix.  4.	Consider each objective carefully and choose the most appropriate assessment method.5.  A sample matrix is displayed below.6.  To make your own matrix, copy the matrix below and paste it into a new file using the Drawing option in the New Document dialog box.  7.  In the Drawing option, the elements of the matrix can be edited.  ASSESSMENT MATRIX         DSET   #   ( H       A   g7i                >                       @  	 6@                E     @   @       i|    E     @    @        ix    E     @    @        it    E     @    @        ip    E     @    @       il    E     @ H  @ T      ih    E     	    <           E     	    <           E     	    <       	    E     	    <       

    Ih  IThe "Assessment Matrix" is designed to help you assure that each of the goals or objectives you have defined for your interactive multimedia product is assessed by one or more reliable and valid outcome measures.  All too often development teams wait until a product is almost complete before "making up a test" intended to measure its outcomes.  That is generally too late.  By planning for assessment early in the design stage of your product, you will have a much greater chance of designing a program that is actually capable of achieving its objectives.  This tool will help you to consider alternative assessment procedures because traditional paper and pencil tests are often inadequate indicators of a program's outcomes.  Alternative performance assessment strategies such as "observations" and "portfolios" should be considered.           

    %i  %The "Assessment Checklist" is designed to help you assure that each of the objectives you have defined for your interactive multimedia product is accompanied by one or more reliable and valid measures.  All too often development teams wait until a product is almost complete before "making up a test" intended to measure its outcomes.  That is generally too late.  By planning for assessment early in the design stage of your product, you will have a much greater chance of designing a program that is actually capable of achieving its objectives.          

<H3>Project Description</H3>
Students in an undergraduate mechanical engineering program traditionally experience difficulty in modeling dynamic systems.  The trouble is caused by a number of factors.  First, the concepts taught in these courses rely on mathematical knowledge learned at an earlier time in the curriculum.  These courses also require hands-on experiments and simulations in order for the students to gain an appreciation of the practical side of control theory. A  problem affecting a significant amount of students is making the connection between the time domain and the frequency domain.  Frequency response techniques for control system design and analysis of dynamic systems are therefore difficult for students to grasp.  The specific nature of the frequency response method lends itself to another problem:  the inability of students to recognize and work with people in other areas of the design.  A student's ability to understand the role that his particular problem plays in the "big picture" is just as important as his ability to solve specific problems.
<p>
An interactive computer program can be created which will aid in students' understanding of control system analysis and design--specifically, the frequency response method.  Just as engineers use technology as a tool for design, engineering teachers can use technological tools to aid in the learning process.  Computers are at the heart of this educational technology.  A computer program that facilitates the learning of the frequency response method can use video, sound, and other aspects of multimedia to bridge the gap between the laboratory and the lecture.  It can easily illustrate the role that a certain problem has in the design of an entire system as well.  The program is interactive in the sense that the student can determine the rate and direction of the instruction.  Also, questions about the theory and laboratory experiments can be asked and the answers recorded.  In this way, an interactive program can combine the aspects of lecture, lab work, and homework into one package, the end result being a comprehensive review of the material learned in the normal curriculum, in addition to the integration of this material into the overall system.

    i  An important product of the analysis phase of a multimedia development project is a clear description of the salient characteristics of the users of the multimedia program.  In other words, you want to define your target audience accurately and in sufficient detail to make sound design decisions.  The checklist presented below includes four major categories of user characteristics: 1) cognitive, 2) personality, 3) social, and 4) physical.  Obviously, any given multimedia program cant be adaptable for every kind of individual difference, but multimedia can be designed to accommodate the user characteristics that are most critical in one or more specific contexts.           

In many (if not most) multimedia development projects, you will want to specify the performance objectives for users of your program.  Having precise performance objectives will enable you to design better interactions into your program and to develop valid instruments for assessing the outcomes of the program.   2.	Performance objectives can be written for three domains, the cognitive, the psychomotor, and the affective.  The cognitive domain refers to the intellectu  *al processes involved in a job or content area.  These can range from simple recall of information to higher order problem solving.  The psychomotor domain refers to skills that require the use and coordination of the body in physical activity such as opening a container or moving a box.  The affective domain refers to attitudes, beliefs, values, and emotions such as enjoying or appreciating.  3.	Writing performance objectives for the psychomotor domain is generally straightforward, e.g., the trainee will put on safety goggles and gloves before opening a container of any chemical substance.  Writing performance objectives for the cognitive or affective domain can be much more difficult.  Therefore, a list of verbs that can help you write better objectives in these domains is provided below.4.	  Whenever you write objectives, review the verbs below to select the ones most appropriate to your job or content.  This is by no means a complete list of all the possible verbs and its primary value may be in spurring your imagination in writing better objectives.    OBJECTIVES SPECIFICATION TOOL Observable Verbs in the Cognitive Domain:Level 1 - Knowledge or the ability to recall information.arrangedefineduplicatelabellistmatchmemorizenameorderrecognizerecallrepeatreproduceLevel 2 - Comprehension or interpreting information in ones own words.classifydescribediscussexplainexpressidentifyindicatelocaterecognizereportrestatereviewselectsorttelltranslateLevel 3 - Application or using knowledge in a novel situation.applychoosedemonstratedramatizee  mployillustrateinterpretoperatepreparepracticeschedulesketchsolveuseLevel 4 - Analysis or breaking down knowledge into parts and showing interrelationships.analyzeappraisecalculatecomparecontrastcriticizediagramdifferentiatediscriminatedistinguishexamineexperimentinventoryquestiontestLevel 5 - Synthesis or bringing together parts of knowledge to form a whole and solve a problem.arrangeassemblecollectcomposeconstructcreatedesignformulatemanageorganizeplanprepareproposeset upsynthesizewriteLevel 6 - Evaluation or making judgments on the basis of criteria.appraiseargueassessattackchoosecomparedefendestimateevaluatejudgepredictratescoreselectsupportvalueObservable Verbs in the Cognitive Domain:agreeargueassumeattemptattend toavoidchallengecooperatedefenddisagreeengage inhelpjoinofferparticipatepraiseresistsharevolunteer     DSET       ( H       h   i                                    g 

    i  A key element in the instructional development process is to specify the objectives for your program as clearly as possible.  Vague or poorly stated objectives often result in instruction that is inappropriate or assessment that is invalid.  For example, consider the following objective: Trainees will understand the importance of safety procedures on the job.  Such a vague objective provides little direction for how training should be designed or how the performance of this objective can be assessed.  This tool is designed to help you write more specific objectives by providing you with a list of observable verbs.    The tool includes verbs for both the cognitive (knowledge or intellectual processing) domain and affective (attitudes or values) domain.           

Each of the components in the plan should be addressed.3.	It is a good idea to have the plan reviewed by all team members before attempting to implement it.  EVALUATION PLAN TEMPLATE   lIntroduction:  This section introduces the major sections of the plan as well as the primary people involved in writing the plan.Background:  This section describes any information which is needed to provide the reader with an understanding of the background of the interactive multimedia that is being evaluated. Purposes:  This section thoroughly describes the purposes of the evaluation.  A single plan can address a variety of purposes, but all must be delineated clearly.  Evaluation is always a political process and all parties must accept the purposes for the evaluation to be successful.Limitations:  This section spells out any limitations to the interpretation and generalizability of the evaluation.  It should also describe potential threats to the reliability and validity of the evaluation design and instrumentation.Audiences:  This section specifies   all the primary and secondary audiences or consumers of the evaluation.  In general, it is recommended to open the evaluation up to as many people or agencies as the client will allow.Decisions:  This section is probably the most difficult, but it should be included if the evaluation is to have meaningful impact on decision-making.  Trying to anticipate the decisions which can be influenced by an evaluation takes creativity and trust.  Many developers do not wish to anticipate negative outcomes for their efforts, but these too must be considered.Questions:  A key element of a sound evaluation plan is careful specification of the questions to be addressed by the evaluation design and data collection methods.  The clearer and more detailed these questions are, the more likely that you will be able to provide reliable and valid answers to them.Methods:  This section describes the evaluation designs and procedures.  T  here are scores of designs and hundreds of procedures which can be used.  The keys to success are matching these options to the purposes and questions of your client and keeping within the budget and time line of the study.Sample:  This section specifies exactly which students, trainers, and other personnel will participate in the evaluation.  If necessary, a rationale for sample sizes should also be included.Instrumentation:  This section describes all the evaluation instruments and tools to be used in the evaluation.  Actual instruments should be included in appendices for review and approval.  Logistics:  This section spells out who will be responsible for the various implementation, analysis, and reporting aspects of the evaluation.Time Line:  This section presents the schedule for implementation, analysis, and reporting of the evaluation.Budget:  This section "costs out" the finances for the evaluation.     DSET       ( H       h   i                                    g 

    ]i  ]An essential component of evaluating an interactive multimedia program (or any other type of program) is preparing a sound evaluation plan.  The "Evaluation Plan Template" tool includes the major topics that should be included in a reliable and valid evaluation plan.  One unique aspect of this plan template is that it encourages you to consider decisions that must be made and should be affected by the evaluation data you collect.  The strategy seems simple, but is very challenging in actuality.  Working with your team, you need to anticipate as many possible decisions that may be made about the IMM program you are developing or implementing.  For each decision, try to identify questions that must be answered to help you make a better decision.  Then and only then should you decide on the evaluation design and data collection methods to be employed.         

    mi  mThe objectives for an interactive multimedia program should answer four essential questions about the performance or outcomes of your program: who is to accomplish the performance, what the performance is, the conditions under which the performance will occur, and the criterion or standards by which performance will be judged.  The Objectives Review Checklist is a tool that can help assure that your objectives are stated as clearly as possible.  Precise and unambiguous objectives provide useful direction for designing interactive multimedia as well as essential information upon which to base your assessments.           

The tool is merely a template.  You should modify it as needed for your distinct purposes.  2.  Using a questionnaire (or an interview or focus group) is a type of survey activity.  Conducting a survey should be done systematically.  The overall steps in the survey process are:a.	Organize the survey team.b.	Determine the survey goal.c.	Select a representative sample.d.	Generate the questions.e.	Construct the instrument (questionnaire, interview protocol, or 		focus group protocol).f.	Test the instrument.g.	Adm  inister the instrument.h.	Analyze the data.i.	Share and use the results.  3.  Consider collecting audience information with more than one method if time and resources allow.  For example, a questionnaire can be used to collect some baseline information about audience needs.  Then, either interviews or focus groups can be used to collect more detailed information.  Alternatively, interviews or focus groups can be used to define the issues involved in audience characteristics, and a questionnaire can be used to confirm or refine the issues. 4.  A sample questionnaire for a needs assessment begins on the next page. NEEDS QUESTIONNAIRE  OVERVIEW:Clarifying the nature and needs of the audience(s) for training or information systems is one of the most important activities during the Analysis phase of instructional systems design.  Especially when a new program is being developed, the audiences for the program must be carefully analyzed to assure that all their needs are met and all their preferred modes of learning or accessing information are considered.  A questionnaire is one of the three primary ways of collecting needs assessment information.  The other two ways are interview and focus group.  Some of the advantages of questionnaires are:1.  Questionnaires are especially useful when the respondents must remain anonymous.  They can be distributed and returned in ways that respondents can feel confident that their identities are secure.2.  Questionnaires can be an efficient means of collecting information from the point of view of the respondents.  Questionnaires should be brief s  o that respondents spend no more than ten to fifteen minutes completing them.3.  Different forms of questionnaires can be distributed to different audiences.  This strategy is particularly useful when you have a large pool of potential respondents and a lot of questions to ask about the audience.  Through a process called "matrix sampling" you can ask some of the respondents to respond to one part of the questionnaire and other respondents to respond to another part of the questionnaire.  4.  There are many different types of questions that can be included in a questionnaire.  Some popular types of questions (or items) include:a.  open-ended, e.g., What is the type of documentation to which you most frequently refer with an interactive program of this kind?b.  multiple-choice, e.g.,Which is your least preferred source of information about a new program?__ On-line documentation       __ Paper Documentation      __ interactive multimedia  c.  ratings or rankings, e.g.,Rank order   the following sources from 1 (most effective) to 4 (least effective).__ On-line documentation       __ Paper Documentation      __ interactive multimedia       __ Training Seminard.  Likert-scale, e.g.,My preferred sources for new product information is a hypermedia program that I can use on my own personal computer at home or in the office.__Strongly Agree      __Agree       __No Opinion      __Disagree      __ Strongly DisagreeSome of the disadvantages of questionnaires are:1.  Questionnaires are relatively easy to design, but good questionnaires represent a significant investment in time and expertise to prepare.2.  Questionnaires can take considerable time to distribute, process, analyze, and report.  3.  Questionnaires are not as flexible as interviews or focus groups.  The latter permit the exploration of unanticipated issues whereas questionnaires usually only provide information directly related to the specific questions included in them.  4.  Many people are   reluctant to respond to questionnaires and response rates of forty percent or lower are not unusual.  SAMPLE QUESTIONNAIREAs you probably know, we are developing a new training program about the new information system being designed for this institution.  We request your completion of this questionnaire to help us learn more about your training and information needs and preferences.  The information you and others provide will assist us in our continuing effort to provide better training.Your answers will be handled in the strictest confidence.  Your answers will be tabulated with those of others to determine information needs, usage patterns, content requirements, format preferences, and overall quality.Thank you for your time and assistance.1.To help us evaluate your answers, please indicate by checking..... your computer experience.__ 1 year or less       __ 5 to 9 years__ 2 years                __ 10 years or more__ 3 to 4 years your job experience.__ 1 year or less        __ 5   to 9 years__ 2 years                 __ 10 years or more__ 3 to 4 years your primary activity.__ Sales Engineer__ Systems Engineer__ Field Engineer__ Professional Services__ Customer Services__ Manager__ Other (please specify)  ________________________________________2.When you receive a new information system, what are your preferences for finding out initial information about it?  Rate the following from 1 = "most preferred" to 8 = "least preferred.

The Multimedia Feasibility Survey indicates the types of questions that can be asked during an interview or focus group or on a questionnaire.  You should modify the questions to fit the context in which your program will be used.  2.  A useful strategy is to collate and summarize the results of one round of the survey, and then to share the results with the same or a different group to have them modify or clarify your findings as needed.     pMultimedia Feasibility Survey1.

    si  sIn many projects, trainers or teachers will be expected to implement an interactive multimedia program at a local site such as a training center, school, or campus.  Obtaining input from these people as early as possible in the design phase of your project is essential.  You can obtain a great deal of useful information from instructors concerning the feasibility of implementing multimedia.  They can also provide many good ideas for the design of your program.  The information is the survey below could be obtained in a number of ways, e.g., face-to-face or telephone interviews, mailed questionnaires, or focus groups.           

The Goal Analysis Tool is based upon the work of Robert Mager.  For more direction in this area, please refer to the following books:Mager, R. F. (1984). Goal analysis (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Lake.  Mager, R. F. (1984). Preparing instructional objectives (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Pitman.  2.	  (The procedures included in this tool should not be applied in a lock step manner.  Instead, they simply provide a starting point for this extremely difficult and politically challenging task of getting people to agree upon a set of goals for a multimedia program.  Modify the steps as needed.    GOAL ANALYSIS TOOLStep 1 - Write down the goals.  Use what ever words are comfortable, regardless of how fuzzy or vague they be. This is the place for such words. You are just getting started and this step will help you remember where the analysis started in the first place.It is politically useful to have the goals written down because you can get people (clients, instructors, workers, students, etc.) to reflect upon the goals and provide you with some indication of the degree to which they share them. Eventually you will want them to agree upon the specific performance objectives that represent the operational definitions of the goals. At this point, the major task is to get people talking abou  t the goals.  Make sure your statement describes an intended outcome rather than a process. Make your statement say "have a favorable attitude toward safety in the workplace" rather than "learn to have a favorable attitude toward safety in the workplace."Step 2 - Write down everything someone would have to say or do for you to agree that the someone has achieved the goal.Write down everything that comes to mind, and don't worry about being neat at this point. First get it down, then get it good. The reason you must complete this step without being judgmental is because it is difficult to search through the cloud of fuzzy ideas for the specifics you are looking for. Here are four strategies that you might try:1.	Answer the question, "What will ____ take as e  $vidence that the goal has been achieved?"2.	Answer the question, "Given a room full of people, what is the basis on which I would separate them into two piles - those who achieved my goal and those who have not?"3.	If you were going to tell another person what to look for to determine that the goal had been achieved, what would you tell them to look for?4.	Think of someone who has achieved the goal and write down everything they do.Step 3 - Sort the items Listed in step 2.1.	Cross out duplications and items that, on second thought, do not represent the meaning of the goal.2.	Place check marks beside the items that do not qualify as performances; that is check for "fuzzies."3.	Treat the "fuzzies" like new goals or subgoals and repeat step 2.  Iterate until all "fuzzies" have been   $clarified.Step 4 - Write a complete sentence to describe each of the items on your final list.	Each sentence should describe an outcome that must be achieved before you are willing to say that the goal has been achieved. These statements should say:1.	Who  is to do some thing.2.	What are they to do.3. Under what conditions they are expected to do it.  4.	How well  are they expected to do it.Step 5 - Test the sentences for completeness.	Test the collection of sentences to to see if you are finished with the analysis. Ask yourself the question, "If all these things occurred as described, would I be willing to say that the goal has been achieved?" If the answer is no, ask yourself the question, "What else would have to be achieved before I could agree the goal has been achieved?"     DSET       ( H       h   i                                    g 

    qi  qAn interactive multimedia program can address many different goals.  Before proceeding to the design stage, you will want to obtain agreement about a programs goals among the major parties involved in the development of a multimedia program.  These parties will include the clients, the users, the instructors, or anyone else with a major stake in the program.  The Goal Analysis Tool, provides a strategy for gradually refining goals and describing the processes by which the attainment of goals can be assessed.  A through goal analysis will provide you with a sound basis for writing precise performance objectives.            

Each of the components in the report should be addressed.3.	It is a good idea to have the report reviewed by all internal team members before presenting it to your client.  ANALYSIS REPORT TEMPLATE Executive:  This section presents an overview of the analysis findings in a format that allows decision makers to make important decisions effectively and efficientlyIntroduction:  This section introduces the major sections of the report as well as the primary people involved in conducting the analysis and producing the report.  The client is also clearly identified.  Background:  This section describes any information which is needed to provide the reader with an understanding of the backgrou  =nd for the analysis, e.g., who initiated it and why. Purposes:  This section describes the purpose(s) of the analysis.  For example, a needs assessment might be done to detect training or education needs that arent being met by existing programs.  Or a needs assessment might be done to confirm the existence of needs or clarify the nature of needs that others have perceived.  A job or task analysis might be undertaken to collect information directly related to the nature of the interactive multimedia product under development.  Limitations:  This section spells out any limitations to the interpretation and generalizability of the analysis.  It should also describe threats to the reliability and validity of the instruments (e.g., questionnaires, interview protocols, or focus group protocols) used in the analysis.  Questions:  A key element of an effective analysis is careful specification of the questions to be addressed by the analysis methods.  The clearer and more detailed these questions are, the more likely that you will be able to provide useful answers to them.  It is usually a good idea to collect needs assessment data in several ways from several sources, especially in projects that are quite costly.  Methods:  This section describes the   #analysis techniques used such as observations and surveys.  Step-by-step descriptions of what was done should be provided.  Sample:  This section describes the students, trainers, and other personnel included in the analysis.Instrumentation:  This section describes all the instruments and tools that were used during the analysis.  Copies of the tools should be included in the Appendices.  Results:  This section spells out the findings.  Graphs and charts should be used wherever they are appropriate.  Recommendations:  This section presents recommendations based upon the findings report in the previous section.Summary:  This section presents a brief easy to digest synopsis of the report.References:  This last section lists the sources reviewed or consulted during the analysis.       DSET       ( H       h   i                                    g 

    i  Just as it is important to conduct a good needs assessment, it is also essential to report the findings in a clear, concise manner that decision-makers can understand and use.  The "Analysis Report Template" tool lists the major topics that should be included in a needs assessment or task analysis report.  The formality of the report will depend upon the size and scope of the project and the nature of your relationship with the client.  It is easy to get so caught up in the analysis phase of a project that there may not be enough time for the equally important design, production, and evaluation phases.  On the other hand, the clearer and more accurate your analysis, the more likely it is that your project will be focused on the real needs of the client and thereby be successful.           

The tool below is merely a template.  You should modify it as needed for your distinct purposes.  2.  Using an interview protocol (or a focus group or questionnaire) is a type of survey activity.  Conducting a survey should be done systematically.  The overall steps in the survey process are:a.	Organize the survey team.b.	Determine the survey goal.c.	Select a representative sample.d.	Generate the questions.e.	Construct the instrument (questionnaire, interview protocol, or 		focus group protocol).f.	Test the instrument.g.	Adm  inister the instrument.h.	Analyze the data.i.	Share and use the results.  3.  Consider collecting audience information with more than one method if time and resources allow.  For example, a questionnaire can be used to collect some baseline information about audience needs.  Then, either interviews or focus groups can be used to collect more detailed information.  Alternatively, interviews or focus groups can be used to define the issues involved in audience characteristics, and a questionnaire can be used to confirm or refine the issues.4.  A sample interview protocol for a needs assessment begins on the next page.  NEEDS INTERVIEW PROTOCOL  OVERVIEW:The following protocol is designed to help you interview employees, supervisors, managers, students, etc. about their needs related to a new job or task.  Often, interviews are conducted after you have collected some general data about needs with a questionnaire.  Interviews allow you to explore needs and preferences in more detail than can be obtained with a questionnaire.  Alternatively, interviews are sometimes used in lieu of questionnaires when time does not permit you to distribute questionnaires to a larger sample of people.Interview protocols consist of a set a primary questions and a set of probing or secondary questions that are associated with each primary question.  You should ask the primary question first and give the interviewee sufficient time to respond before asking a probing question.  You should continue to ask probing questions until you are satisfied that the interviewee has given you as much information as you are likely to get related   to the specific topic.  Then, you move on to the next primary question and repeat the process.  (There may also be a set of brief questions about the background of the interviewee.)  One of the most challenging aspects of interviewing is capturing what an interviewee tells you.  Of course, you may wish to have interviews recorded and have the interview transcribed later.  However, some people are intimidated by recorded interviews and the logistics of recording can be difficult and awkward, especially for telephone interviews.  An alternative approach is to take notes during the interview and then to write out longer interpretations of the responses very soon after the interview is over.  On the other hand, taking notes during an interview is a skill that must be developed and practiced over time.  Some authorities, e.g. Michael Quinn Patton (1987), insist that a tape recorder is an indispensable piece of equipment for interviewers.  Among the advantages of taping interviews are: tape recorde  rs do not "tune out" of the conversation, tape recorders do not change what is said through interpretation, tape recorders do not slow down the conversation,  tape recorders do not miss what is said, and tape recorders allow the interviewer to concentrate on the interview.SAMPLE INTERVIEW PROTOCOL1.

However, when faced with the difficult task of estimating the size and scope of a project, it can be useful to consider some rules of thumb that other instructional designers use to estimate what might be involved in an instructional development project.2.	Rules of thumb are provided for the following types of products:	a.  Reading Materials	b.  Audio and Video Scripts	c.  Format Sheets for Interactive Training	d.  Introductions and Summaries for Audio, Video or Interactive 		     Segments	e.  Instructor Orientation Materials	f.  Lesson Plan Notes	g.  Overhead Transparencies or Flip Chart Visuals	h.  Exercises	i.  Quizzes  Project Estimation Rules of Thumb(Adapted from Greer, 1992*)Here are some rules of thumb that some old hands in the training business use to estimate the amount of materials required for traditional and interactive training courses:a.  Reading Materials:Rule:Up to 20 pages for each hour of trainee reading.  An experienced instructional designer will spend approximately one hour per page of finished reading material.  Explanation:These include anything that trainees are asked to read, e.g., class handouts, text of workbooks, etc.  Exercises and quizzes are not included.b.  Audio and Video Scripts:Rule:About 1 1/3 pages of script for each minute of audio, 2 pages of script for each minute of video.  Storyboards take more pages per minute.  A page of script for audio can be written by an experienced script writer in one hour, a page of video script in 90 minutes, and one storyboard takes an average of 30 minutes.  Expl  anation:If your own designers are writing their own scripts, use these rules of thumb.  If you are subcontracting the script writing out to media producers, simply tell them how many minutes you will need.c.  Format Sheets for Interactive Training:Rule:Ten or more format sheets may be required for each minute of interactive training material used by trainees.  Experienced designers can produce four format sheets per hour.  Storyboards for video or animation sequences may take more pages per minute at a rate of production of one storyboard per thirty minutes.  Explanation:Formatting your intended interactions for CBT or interactive multimedia is essential for formative review and accurate communications with other members of a design team such as programmers and graphic artists.  d.  Introductions and Summaries for Audio, Video or Interactive Segments:Rule:About a 1/2 page for each introduction or summaryExplanation:Th  ese "set-ups" or reviews may be required in trainee and/or instructor materials, especially when the segment is lengthy or the material complex.  Explanations of how to get started with interactive training materials are especially critical.  An experienced designer will write an introduction or summary in an hour.e.  Instructor Orientation Materials:Rule:10 to 15 pages for a one day courseExplanation:This material describes the general instructor skills required, facilities and set-up requirements, overall expectations regarding the orchestration of events during the course, etc.  An experienced designer will write orientation material at the rate of one page per hour.f.  Lesson Plan Notes:Rule:About 10 pages for  ^ every hour of lesson plansExplanation:Lesson plans should include:  clearly stated objectives  detailed lecture notes  ideas for getting and maintaining trainee attention/motivation  references  recommendations for remedial or enrichmentAn experienced instructional designer will write lesson plans at the rate of one page per hour.g.  Overhead Transparencies or Flip Chart Visuals:Rule:About ten per hour of instructor led presentation or demonstrationExplanation:This is a difficult one to estimate because some complex content may require substantially more visually.  It is a good idea to examine those used in similar courses before making a final estimate.  An experienced instructional designer can produce two overhead transparencies or flip chart visual per hour.  Often the instructional designer will sketch out the illustration an  d a graphic artist will produce the final product.  h.  Exercises:Rule:Up to 5 pages of material for each trainee exerciseExplanation:Exercises include hands-on activities such as role-playing, in-basket exercises, assignments, and drill-and-practice materials.  Experience designers design exercises at the rate of one page per hour.i.  Quizzes:Rule:One page for every two test items.Explanation:A general rule of thumb is to have at least two test items for each objective provided that the objectives are behavioral based and defined very carefully.  Quizzes are much more difficult to prepare than most instructional designers realize.  Quizzes often requires the assistance of test, measurement, and/or evaluation specialists to assure that the quizzes are reliable and valid.  Allow at least 30 minutes of professional time for each test item.  *Greer, M.  (1992).  ID Project Management: Tools and techniques for instructional designers and developers.

    i  The "Project Estimation Rules" presented in this tool are based upon the "best guesses" of experienced instructional designers.  There is a lack of science in these estimates, but at least they give you a place to start in estimating the time and resources needed for an interactive multimedia development project.  Many important development aspects are not included in these "rules of thumb," e.g., authoring time and video or graphics production time.           

There are three primary ways of finding out more about the audience, tasks, and content involved in a project:a. Observations are sometimes cons  midered the most direct method of collecting needs assessment data, although in many cases, a great deal of inference is involved in interpreting observations.b. Interviews are considered the easiest way of collecting needs assessment data.  Questionnaires and focus groups may also be relatively effective and efficient methods.  However, what people tell you and what they really do may differ.  It is sometimes important to verify the results of interviews with observations and document analysis.c. Documentation review, e.g., looking at employee personnel records, can provide useful needs assessment data.  Of course, in some situations, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain desired documents.  2.	The matrix below should be reviewed when deciding upon the strategy or mix of strategies you will employ to collect needs assessment data for your project.       DSET   |    ( H       .   vi                                                  o        i        6    *                                                     o            o        ` (  

    i  The "Needs Assessment Matrix" is a simple tool that suggests different ways of gathering information regarding audiences, tasks, and content while conducting a needs assessment for an interactive multimedia development project.  The easiest way of obtaining needs assessment information is to interview people, but interviews have limitations as well.  The ideal procedure is to "triangulate" the information you need by collecting it via two or more ways!          

    Bi  BRobert Gagn is a major contributor to both behavioral and cognitive learning theory.  One of his most notable contributions is a model of instruction that includes nine critical events such as "Grabbing the Learner's Attention" at the beginning of a lesson.  Although the model seems quite simple, it has been shown to be an effective way to organize instruction across a wide variety of subjects.  It is one model of instruction that might be employed in an interactive multimedia program.  Of course, there are other models that may be more appropriate in your situation.            

The tool is merely a template.  You should modify it as needed for your distinct purposes.  2.  Conducting a focus group interview (or a regular interview or questionnaire) is a type of survey activity.  Conducting a survey should be done systematically.  The overall steps in the survey process are:  a.	Organize the survey team.b.	Determine the survey goal.c.	Select a representative sample.d.	Generate the questions.e.	Construct the instrument (questionnaire, interview protocol, or 		focus group protocol).f.	Test the instrument.g.	Administer the instrument.h.	Analyze the data.i.	Share and use the results.3.  Consider collecting audience information with more than one method if time and resources allow.  For example, a questionnaire can be used to collect some baseline information about audience needs.  Then, either interviews or focus groups can be used to collect more detailed information.  Alternatively, interviews or focus groups can be used to define the issues involved in audience characteristics, and a questionnaire can be used to confirm or refine the issues. 4.  A sample Focus Group protocol for a needs assessment begins on the next page.  NEEDS FOCUS GROUP PROTOCOL  OVERVIEW:The following protocol is designed to help you conduct a "focus group" interview with employees, students, managers, or any other group about their needs related to an interactive multimedia program you are developing.  Focus groups may be conducted at anytime during the Analysis Phase of a project.  For example, one or more focus group interviews may be conducted after you have collected some general data about needs with a questionnaire.  Focus groups allow you to explore information needs and preferences in more detail than can be obtained with a questionnaire, plus they have some advantages over one-on-one interviews.  Focus groups are sometimes used in lieu of one-on-one interviews because you can get more information from a group in a shorter period of time and check the reliability of the information at the same time.  Focus group protocols consist of a set a primary questions and a set of secondary questions designed to get others in the focus   group to either confirm or disagree with the first respondent's answers.  It is recommended that two people conduct a focus group interview with groups of six to eight people.  One of the interviewers will serve as the moderator, asking the questions and encouraging others to speak.  It is crucial that the moderator build an atmosphere of sharing among the group members so that one or two people don't dominate the discussion. The other interviewer is primarily charged with taking notes.  A challenging aspect of any type of interviewing is capturing what is said.  The best option is to have the interviews recorded and then have the interview transcribed later.  The second interviewer can use his/her notes to annotate the actual transcript.  Focus groups generally last from 30 minutes to two hours.  Some of the advantages of focus group interviews are: they are highly efficient ways of collecting information; in one hour you can get the opinions of eight people; they provide some quality c  ontrols and reliability checks on the information; participants tend to provide checks and balances for the views of others; and they tend to be fairly painless, even enjoyable ways for participants to provide important information during the instructional design process.Some of the disadvantages of focus group interviews are: only a limited number of questions can be covered, approximately ten per hour; considerable group process skill is needed to conduct an effective, efficient focus group interview; and unexpected diversions can occur in a focus group such as power struggles among participants.SAMPLE FOCUS GROUP PROTOCOL1.When you obtain a new job, what types of training programs are most useful to you? Do you agree with that?   What do you do that is different from that person? Do you feel that way too? You look like you disagree with what was just said.

(Remember that evaluation is different from assessment in that evaluation is focused on the effectiveness and worth of programs or products whereas assessment is focused on estimating student learning.)  2.	List your questions on the vertical side of the matrix.3.	List the feasible data collection methods on the horizontal side of the matrix.  4.	Consider each question carefully and choose the most appropriate data collection method.5.  A sample matrix is displayed below.6.  To make your own matrix, copy the matrix below and paste it into a new file using the Drawing option in the New Document dialog box.  7.  In the Drawing option, the elements of the matrix can be edited.  EVALUATION MATRIX         DSET  $ 2   ( H             l                A       l                   

      Although by all appearances, the "Evaluation Matrix" is a very simple tool, it has a powerful purpose.  It helps you to consider a wider range of data collection methods than you might otherwise consider in relation to each of the questions addressed by your evaluation.  Evaluators sometimes get into the habit of using one or other data collection method, e.g., an end-of-training questionnaire, without considering the advantages of alternative methods.  This tool prompts you to consider each evaluation question and to decide which of the many data collection options have the greatest potential for providing the desired information.            

The Job/Content Analysis tool will help you collect and organize the information regarding the nature of a specific job or specific content or subject areas.  2.	Information for the Job/Content Analysis can be conducted in several ways, e.g., observations, interviews, or analysis of existing documents.  It is usually appropriate to collect information for an analysis in several ways.  Suppose you want to design a multimedia program that will show workers the proper procedures for taking care of a chemical spill in the workplace.  You might start by reviewing documentation provided by government agencies (such as the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration (OSHA)) or your client (such as Delta Airlines).  Then, you might interview the people in your clients organization who are responsible for safety concerning problems that have occurred in the past.  Later, you might take a tour of the workplace to observe the work practic  es regarding the handling, storage, and disposal of chemicals.  Finally, you might interview some workers to determine their present awareness of the safety procedures.  3.	Content analysis can be somewhat more difficult than job analysis because there is often no precise observations that can be made with respect to how knowledge is applied.  But suppose you want to develop a multimedia program about the History of World War II for secondary school students.  Such a historical event is very complex and even with the amazing storage capabilities of a CD-ROM, you cannot include everything known about World War II in your program.  How do you decide which content to include?  You might start by analyzing the content of some popular history books about the war.  After you have prepared a draft outline of the topics, you could ask several historians to review your outline for gaps or inaccuracies.  You would want to interview history teachers to find out what topics they consider most important abo  ut this war.   More importantly, you would want to work with teachers to develop assignments that can be used with this content.  How the information will be used is an important issue in deciding what to keep in the program.  Suppose the assignment is to analyze why the United States military command decided to use the atomic bomb on Japan, but did not use this weapon on Germany.  Obviously, you would want your program to include considerable material about the Manhattan Project, time lines of the development of the bomb and the progress in the different theaters of the war, data about the attitudes of Americans toward their enemies in the conflict, and any other relevant archival material.4.	A Job/Content Analysis is is an important process within the overall multimedia developmen  qt process.  However, it is difficult to know when you are done, especially with respect to content analysis for a large subject area.  A good rule of thumb is to continue the Job/Content Analysis until your job or content experts generally agree that you have specified the most important aspects of the job or content being analyzed.  JOB/CONTENT ANALYSIS TOOL   HJOB ANALYSISJob Title:Description of the Job:Tasks	Tools Used	Standards for	Conditions of		Performance	PerformanceCONTENT ANALYSISSubject Area Title:Content Description and Relevant Definitions:Tasks	Tools Used	Standards for	Conditions of		Performance	Performance     DSET   	   ( H       h   i                                    g 

    Li  LA useful approach to defining precisely what an multimedia program ought to contain is to conduct a job or content analysis.  If your program is intended to train people for a specific job, e.g., graphic artist. you will usually conduct a job analysis.  If your program is aimed at educating people about a specific content or subject area, you will usually conduct a content analysis.  Both types of analysis are quite similar, and in most cases, your analysis will include both job and content analysis.  If your multimedia program is focused on a clearly defined job, e.g., training a secretary how to use a new word-processing program, then the emphasis will be on job analysis.  If however, the multimedia program is focused on general knowledge, e.g., the history of World War II, then the emphasis will be on content analysis.       DSET      ( H          ni                k                               k       i         i             i         i     k   u     i         i   s  k        i         i  X  k       i        6    *                                                   

The tool below is merely a template.  You should modify it as needed for your distinct purposes.  2.  Using an interview protocol is a type of survey activity.  Conducting a survey should be done systematically.  The overall steps in the survey process are:a.	Organize the survey team.b.	Determine the survey goal.c.	Select a representative sample.d.	Generate the questions.e.	Construct the instrument (questionnaire, interview protocol, or 		focus group protocol).f.	Test the instrument.g.	Administer the instrument.h.	Analyze the d  bata.i.	Share and use the results.  3.  Consider collecting evaluation data with more than one method if time and resources allow.  For example, a questionnaire can be used to collect information about global reactions to an interactive multimedia program.  Then, either interviews or focus groups can be used to collect more detailed information.  Alternatively, interviews or focus groups might be used to identify the most important evaluation issues that will be included in a questionnaire sent to many people.4.

This tool is designed to help you decide among three methods of gathering additional information about the needs and audiences for the interactive program you are developing.  The three options for collecting information included in this tool are: questionnaire interview focus group2.  The defining characteristics of these three methods of gathering information are:Questionnaire   is a paper document that presents a set of questions to which a person responds, can be anonymous or the person responding can identify him or herself in some way, can be mailed to the respondent directly or indirectly (some questionnaires are sent to specific people by name; others are sent to types of people such as nurses or teachers without identifying specific individuals),  can have several different types of questions, e.g., multiple choice or open-ended, and  can vary in length, but should rarely take more than ten to fifteen minut  es of a person's time.  Interview   is a set of questions (usually called a protocol) that is asked by one person to another, can be conducted face-to-face in person, over a telephone, or via e-mail, can be anonymous or the person being interviewed can identify him or herself in some way, can have several types of questions, although generally open-ended questions are preferred, can vary in length, but should rarely take more than thirty minutes of a person's time.Focus Group   is a set of questions that is asked by one person to a small group of people, is usually conducted in person, can vary in size, although four to seven people are considered optimal, can be anonymous, but often the people in the focus group are identified eit  her formally (first and last names) or informally (first names only), can vary in length, but should rarely last more than an hour.3.  The advantages and disadvantages of these three methods of gathering information are: Questionnaire Advantages:a.  Questionnaires are especially useful when the respondents must remain anonymous.  They can be distributed and returned in ways that respondents can feel confident that their identities are secure.b.  Questionnaires can be an efficient means of collecting information from the point of view of the respondents.  Questionnaires should be brief so that respondents spend no more than ten to fifteen minutes completing them.c.  Different forms of questionnaires can be distributed to different audien  (ces.  This strategy is particularly useful when you have a large pool of potential respondents and a lot of questions to ask about the audience.  Through a process called "matrix sampling" you can ask some of the respondents to respond to one part of the questionnaire and other respondents to respond to another part of the questionnaire.  d.  There are many different types of questions that can be included in a questionnaire.  Some popular types of questions (or items) include:1.  open-ended, e.g., What is the type of documentation to which you most frequently refer with an interactive program of this kind?2.  multiple-choice, e.g.,Which is your least preferred source of information about a new program?__ On-line documentation       __ Paper Documentation      __ interactive multimedia    c3.  ratings or rankings, e.g.,Rank order the following sources from 1 (most effective) to 4 (least effective).__ On-line documentation       __ Paper Documentation      __ interactive multimedia __ Training Seminar4.  Likert-scale, e.g.,My preferred sources for new product information is a hypermedia program that I can use on my own personal computer at home or in the office.__Strongly Agree      __Agree       __No Opinion      __Disagree      __ Strongly DisagreeQuestionnaire Disadvantages:a.  Questionnaires are relatively easy to design, but good questionnaires represent a significant investment in time and expertise to prepare.b.  Questionnaires can take considerable time to distribute, process, analyze, and report.  c.  Questionnaires are not as flexible as interviews or focus groups.  The latter permit the exploration of unanticipated  { issues whereas questionnaires usually only provide information directly related to the specific questions included in them.  d.  Many people are reluctant to respond to questionnaires and response rates of forty percent or lower are not unusual.  Interview Advantages:a.  Interviews are especially useful when there is a need to explore issues of an undefined nature or considerable complexity.  This is because interviews can be modified "on the fly" to explore unanticipated issues.b.  Interviews can be used to gather information in a relatively brief period of time.  Interviews should not take more than thirty minutes per respondent.  A skilled interviewer can collect useful data from a dozen respondents in a day.   c.  Interviews can be modified from one respondent to another.   For example, if one respondent brings up an unanticipated issue, a new question can be adde  d to the interview protocol that will allow the next respondent to confirm or disconfirm the issue.  d.  Interviews can help you develop a personal empathy with the audiences for your programs.  Interview Disadvantages:a.  Interviews can be threatening, even intimidating for some respondents.  b.  In a person-to-person interview, people may tend to provide the information they think you want instead of what they really feel.  c.  Depending on the nature of the similarities between the interviewer and the interviewee, the answers to questions can be negatively or positively biased.    d.  Interviews can be difficult to schedule, especially person-to-person interviews.  Even telephone interviews can be difficult to set-up with busy peo  ple.   Focus Group Advantages:a.  Focus groups are especially useful when there is a need to explore issues of an undefined nature or considerable complexity.  This is because focus group protocols can be modified "on the fly" to explore unanticipated issues.b.  Focus groups are especially effective in helping respondents deal with complex or controversial issues that one person may be unable or unwilling to explore.  In some cases, a group of respondents can bounce ideas and issues off each other and reach a consensus about the nature of a problem or issue.    c.  The protocols for focus groups can be sharply defined or very open.   d.  Focus gro  ups can help you develop a personal empathy with the audiences for your programs.  Focus Group Disadvantages:a.  Focus groups can time-consuming to set-up and carry out.  b.  If members of a focus group vary widely in status or position, there may be a reluctance on the part of some respondents to participate fully.  c.  Depending on the nature of the similarities between the interviewer and the members of the focus group, the answers to questions can be negatively or positively biased.    d.  Focus groups can be difficult to schedule, especially if management support is not strong.    4.  Once you are ready to use the decision aid, follow these steps:a.  Consider your options for gathering information about the needs and audiences   for your program, namely, questionnaires, interviews, or focus groups.  It is assumed that you have considered their defining characteristics and weighed their advantages and disadvantages.b.  Answer the questions presented in the decision aid before making a final choice.c.  Consider collecting information with more than one method if time and resources allow.  For example, a questionnaire can be used to collect some baseline information about needs.  Then, either interviews or focus groups can be used to collect more detailed information.  Alternatively, interviews or focus groups can be used to define the issues involved in audience characteristics, and a questionnaire can be used to confirm or refine the issues. Needs Assessment Decision Aid   @Answer these questions to help yourself arrive at a decision regarding the type of instrument you will use to collect needs assessment data:1.  Is anonymity of the respondent important?If YES, go to question 3.  If NO, go to question 2.2.  Is the ability to ask new, unanticipated questions important?If YES, go to question 4.If NO, go to question 3.  3.  Do you need the information right away (in less than two to four weeks)?If YES, go to question 7.  If NO, you should use a mailed questionnaire that can be returned anonymously by the respondents.  4.  I  s it difficult to meet with the respondents face to face?If YES, you should use a telephone or e-mail interview.  If NO, go to question 5.  5.  Can the respondents give you as much sixty minutes of their time?If YES, you should use a focus group.  If NO, go to question 6.6.   Can the respondents give you as much as thirty minutes of their time?If YES, you should use a person-to-person or telephone interview.  If NO, go to question 7.  7.  Can respondents be reached via e-mail or fax?If YES, you should distribute a questionnaire via e-mail or fax with instructions on how the respondents can respond anonymously.  If NO, you should use a ma  iled questionnaire that can be returned anonymously by the respondents.  You may have to use express mail services both ways to speed up the process.  For more information about these methods of gathering needs assessment information:Henerson, M. E., Morris, L.

    it  The "Needs Assessment Decision Aid" is a tool designed to help you select the best method (or methods) for collecting information during the needs assessment portion of your analysis effort.  There are three primary information collection methods described in this tool: focus groups, interviews, and questionnaires.  Each has advantages and disadvantages.  The tool includes a list of questions that when you answer them should assist you in selecting the preferred method of collecting the needs assessment data you desire.  Of course, if personnel, temporal, and financial resources permit, it is sound policy to use two or three methods to collect needs data so as to "triangulate" your findings.           

        It is one thing to plan and develop a good interactive multimedia program.  It is entirely another thing to implement it as planned.  Many training innovations have failed because implementation factors (such as instructor motivation) were not considered.  It is essential to make every effort to collect information regarding the actual use of an interactive multimedia program as compared to the planned use.  The "Implementation Log" tool has been designed to make that comparison a little more systematic.           

A Project Diary should contain the following sections:	a copy of the proposal for the project if one was written,	a copy of the project contractual agreement if one exists,	a time line or PERT chart for the project,	a project budget,	copies of vendor contracts for subcontracted work,	copies of the project status reports issued weekly or at other intervals,	copies of sign-off forms used to obtain client sign-off on major milestones,	copies of correspondence related to the project,	a project team organizational chart or roster,	copies of development activity logs from project team members,  	receipts for expenses and copies of invoices related to the project, and	copies of any other documents related to the personnel, budget, or schedule of the project.2.	  A three-ring binder is usually the best method of maintaining the diary.3.	An outline for a Project Diary appears on the next page.PROJECT DIARY OUTLINE A.	Project Proposal - The funding for most interactive multimedia projects is obtained when companies compete via a Request for Proposals (RFP) process.  Suppose a corporation wants to have an interactive multimedia (IMM) information system developed for use by its employees to help them better understand the options they have for retirement plans, health benefits, etc.  The corporation could ask its own internal Human Resources Development (HRD) department to develop the interactive information system, but because the HRD department has never produced such a program before, the corporation decides to    release an RFP in search of a contractor to develop a prototype IMM system.  Several multimedia development companies competed for the contract by writing proposals.  In the best of circumstances, the winning proposal is selected because it represents the best balance of quality, originality, and cost-effectiveness.  A copy of the proposal should definitely be part of any Project Diary.B.	Usually, after winning a RFP competition, a formal contract is written that describes the deliverables for a project such as a CD-ROM with the prototype IMM system pressed on it, installation instructions, and maintenance guidelines.  The contract will also probably spell out the budget and time line for the project including any interim deliverables (e.g., a script), major milestones, payment schedul  e, and so forth.  Obviously, such a contract is an important part of a Project Diary.  C.	In addition to any schedules or time lines included in the project contract, the project manager may also develop internal time lines or charts to help keep track of the schedule of the project and major accomplishments.  Project management software such as MacProject II or Harvard Project Manager can be very useful in this area.  These programs can be used to develop PERT charts that help plan, track, and manage the progress of a project.D.	In addition to the budgetary information in the project contract, a manager will usually maintain spreadsheets that help plan, track, and manage the financial resources of a development project.  Spreadsheet program are available in integrated software packages such a ClarisWorks.  Or a special spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel may be used.  Copies of financial spreadsheets should be kept in the Project Diary.  E.	It is rare that a project   team will have every type of expertise and experience needed to construct an interactive multimedia project, and so often times it is necessary to contract others (called vendors) for special services such as video editing.  Also, even if you do have the internal expertise, it is sometimes less expensive to contract out certain aspects of a large scale development project.  Copies of vendor contracts for subcontracted work are important elements of a Project Diary.F.	Project status reports should be issued at weekly intervals or on the occasion of the completion of some major milestone.  Copies of your status report should be maintained in the Project Diary.  G.	Obtaining client sign-off on major milestones of a project is an important function of the   manager.  Copies of sign-off forms should be kept in the Project Diary.H.	It is a good practice to keep copies of any correspondence (e.g., letters or internal memos) related to the project in the Project Diary.I.	An organizational chart or roster describing the team members assembled for the project and indicating their inter-relationships may be useful, especially in large scale projects in which personnel may not know the roles and responsibilities assigned to others.  Whatever kind of chart or roster   Ris used, a copy should be in the Project Diary.J.	Development activity logs should be maintained by all project team members and tabulated by the project evaluator or manager.  Time data will be invaluable in accounting for the resources used in completing this project.  It may be even more useful in planning for the next project.  Copies of this data should be included in the Project Diary.  K.	Copies of receipts for expenses and invoices for services should be maintained in the Project Diary.L.	Copies of any other documents related to the personnel, budget, or schedule of the project should be included in the Project Diary.  NOTE:  Although the above implies that a Project Diary should be kept in a three-ring binder, it is possible to keep everything in an electronic format provided sufficient back-up procedures are followed.       DSET       ( H       h                                       g 

      Interactive multimedia design projects of any size or scope are usually very complex, and therefore demand the coordination of many different types of people working together.  Record-keeping is an essential task of the project manager.  It is a sound strategy to maintain a Project Diary throughout a multimedia design effort.  This tool provides an outline of the major components of a Project Diary, and provides a rationale for the inclusion of the various sections.           

The Log should contain the level of detail regarding ISD activities that will be useful to you as a project manager.  In order words, do not collect more information than you can really use.3.  The columns include places for dates and times to recorded, place for a project code to be recorded, places for the activity code, and spaces for any necessary explanation.  If your team members are working on only one project, the column for recording project codes can be eliminated.4.  Ideally, this type of instrument would be provided to your team members as an electronic template coordinated with an electronic appointment calendar.  DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY LOG   Multimedia Development Activity Logging System Form1.0  Analysis	3.0 Production  	1.1  Conducting Needs Assessment	3.1 Authoring IMM1.2  Preparing Audience Assessment	3.2 Creating Graphics1.3  Specifying Content and Objectives	3.3 Preparing Adjunct Materials	1.4  Selecting Authoring and Delivery Systems	3.4 Conducting Preproduction	1.5  Planning Project	3.5 Conducting Production	1.6  Planning Evaluation Strategies	3.6 Conducting Postproduction2.0 Design	3.7 Mastering Optical Media2.1 Creating Treatment Specifications	3.8 Integrating Optical Media and Code2.2 Specifying Instructional Interactions	4.0 Evaluation2.3 Flowcharting	4.1 Documenting Project2.4 Prototyping	4.2 Testing IMM2.5 Writing Scripts	4.3 Validating IMM2.6 Formatting Screens	4.4 Conducting Impact Evaluation2.7 Conducting Formative Reviews		DATE 	HOURS PROJECT ACTIVITY	EXPLANATION	             CODE	     CODE     DSET      ( H       h                                       g 

      The "Development Activity Log" is one of the most important tools you will use in your work as a producer of interactive multimedia.  Essentially, the tool provides a way for you and your team members to keep records of the amount of time you spend working on a project and to assign that time to specific projects and activities.  It has many uses, e.g., it provides valuable information for any type of cost effectiveness evaluation that you or your clients might wish to conduct.  Of course, this information is also invaluable for basic accountability purposes.  Using this tool involves two real challenges.  One is making sure that you and everyone else connected with the development effort logs time in an accurate manner.  The second is getting the time data tabulated and reported in a timely manner so that it can be used to make better decisions about project resources.  Project Managers need to monitor and motivate the logging of this data.         

Needless to say, these lengthy reports are unlikely to have much impact on decision-making if people don't even read them.  One way of increasing the likelihood that your evaluation report will be read and acted upon is to report it in easy-to-consume "chunks" of information.  2.  One strategy of chunking an evaluation report is to have no section of your evaluation report longer than two pages.  An illustration of this format is presented below.  The example is divided into four parts: 1) an attention-getting headline, 2) a description of the issues involved in that part of the evaluation, 3) evidence that relates to the issue(s), and 4) a bottom line recommendation based upon the evidenceEVALUATION REPORT SAMPLE   Although students value the self-paced nature of the L2 Algebra I multimedia program, it is not always implemented.   IssuesSelf-paced learning is an academic ideal held forth by many, but few curricula have implemented this principle on a large scale.  The L2 Algebra I course incorporates genuine self-paced learning, but it is not implemented in each school.  Hence, student satisfaction with the self-paced nature of the L2 Algebra I course varies considerably.  Overall, almost 50% of the 1,400 L2 students surveyed agreed with the statement that "The pace of this course is just right."   However, in those schools where teacher-paced guidelines have been most strictly enforced, as many as 90% disagree with the statement!  Overall student satisfaction with the L2 Algebra I course is much lower in those schools that have abandoned the principle of self-paced learning.  Reasons for instituting teacher-pacing may stem fr  om factors outside the teachers' control (e.g., the inability to issue incomplete grades or no provisions for summer school) to differences in individual teacher styles (an inability to tolerate ambiguity or a need for more control).  Regardless of the source, teacher-pacing seems to be a major violation of the L2 program's design.   EvidenceExample comments of students in schools where self-pacing is implemented include:  Most of Garys comments centered around how much he liked the self-paced nature of the instruction.  He told me this: If you dont understand something, the computer will take you back, if you had a teacher and you didnt understand, you would just have to go on.Sheri likes L2 primarily because she enjoys the self-paced instruction.  She also prefers working with a computer to listening to a teacher because she hates teachers that sit there and talk to you for the whole period.Aretha failed   algebra last year in a traditional book-based, teacher-led class.  She appreciates the opportunity that L2 has given her to be independent.  Im on my own.  Here you go, teach yourself.  No excuses.  .....he  [Don] likes it [L2] even more than he thought he would.  Primarily, he likes the self-paced method of instruction.  He told me with a teacher, if you dont understand and the rest of the class does, theyre going to go on without you.He [Jeffrey] would recommend the class to his friends because of the self-paced, individualized nature of L2.  "You go at your own pace and the computer pertains to you better than a teacher," he said.Charles really likes the self-paced learning in L2.  "I can't think of a better way to learn," he said.  He says that in a book class, the teacher goes too fast.   He says that with L2, "you work your butt off" but that in the book class "everyone is failing."  Example comments of students in school  s where teacher-pacing exists include: Her initial reaction to L2 was that it was a lot better than text-based classes! Its self paced! Her favorite aspect of L2 is that it shows you what to do step by step. She especially disliked the fact that after a short period of self paced use, the rules were changed so that L2 time deadlines were placed on students by the teacher. We must be to chapter 8 by the fourth six weeks! The worst thing about L2 is that now they have a teacher imposed pace that if not equaled will result in INCOMPLETES at the end of 6 week grading periods. He [Edward] has already missed one honor roll because of this policy and was peeved.Farrah initially liked L2, ...it seemed easier than the teacher. It was self paced, and had individualized instructio  ns. It was self paced! She expressed definite resentment about the current policy of teacher set pacing.  When asked for her opinion of L2 now Farrah says, I dont like it. Really - there are only so many days to complete X number of topics. If you dont finish them - you get an incomplete. I have some incompletes. A lot of people do. What are they (the administration) going to do at the end of the year?She [Angela] also expressed her feeling that they had been misled regarding the self paced concept. Now we have to be at certain points at the end of each grading period. I had to come after school to keep up.Matt initially was very excited about the L2 program. The self paced approach really appealed to him. By the time the L2 program was discontinued seven weeks ago his attitude toward the program had drastically changed. Matts comments reflect this; When we stopped L2 I disliked   the program a lot. I especially disagree with the time requirements and pass/fail grading policy. You should be given credit for increments in progress. If you havent finished a chapter by the due date you get an F even if you were about 80% finished. This is not right!He [Paul] likes the self-paced aspects of the program, and he said he strongly resents the pressure that the teacher puts on him to make more progress.  He says that when he rushes through a section, he really doesnt learn anything. RecommendationThe National Science Center should work with school administrators, teachers, and parents to assure that the principle of self-paced learning can be implemented within the total educational environment of the local school system.  In those schools where this is not possible, the L2 Algebra I course may be reduced to a supplementary role or eliminated entirely.            DSET       ( H       h                                       g 

    ,  ,The "Evaluation Report Sample" presents one way of structuring an evaluation report.  Evaluation reports are notorious for being weighty volumes that few people read.  Not surprisingly, lengthy reports have little effect on decision-makers.  This tool illustrates a strategy for dividing an evaluation report into two-page sections that each include four parts:1) an attention-getting headline,2) a description of the major issues related to the headline,3) a presentation of data related to the issues, and4) a bottom-line recommendation or summary of the findings.People who receive a report in this format can take two or three sections at a time and make them agenda items for their team meetings.  In this way, the evaluation findings are much more likely to have an impact on practical decisions.           

Instructions:1.	Your Project Status Report should contain the following elements:	A title referring to the project.	A date and identification of the person preparing the report.	A list of accomplishments since the last report.	  VA list of pending items yet to be resolved.	A list of any concerns and recommended actions to resolve them.	Any other remarks that might be made to inform, reward, or motivate team members.  2.	Prepare a Project Status Report at regular intervals, usually once a week.3	Keep copies of the Project Status Reports in the project notebook or diary.  (It is sometimes a good idea to provide the client with copies as well.  In other cases, it may be better to keep these reports internal to the project team)4.	A sample Project Status Report appears on the next page.PROJECT STATUS REPORT   Model 17 Training (Project No. XY768)Date:  June 17, 1994                                   From:  Judy UptodateAccomplishments:   (Since June 10th report.)   	Began the analysis, which included meeting with technical SMEs and interviewing trainees  	Arranged for renting an XYZ Model 17 for the development team for authoring  purposes  	Decided to use the 5/28 version of the software; later versions are too unstablePending Items:  	Complete task analysis and revision of preliminary objectives   	Brainstorm with designers re: creative design strategies    	Start writing Design PlansConcerns and Recommended Actions:  	Bud Delay doesnt like his proposed role as reviewer.  Recommend using Martha Smart instead.    	Engineering still won't discuss the new  attachment for the XYZ.

      The "Project Status Report" is a very simple tool with a very important purpose.  Essentially, this tool is one of the primary inputs to your project diary.  The project manager should prepare project status reports at regular intervals, usually once a week, to keep your client and your team informed as to the progress (or lack thereof) with respect to the project.  It may also be useful to issue special project status reports whenever some important milestone has been accomplished, e.g., pressing a CD-ROM disk.           

The sample screens below were taken from "Macintosh Fundamentals and Beyond," an award-winning training course from Apple Computer, Inc. developed in 1989.SCREEN DESIGN GUIDELINES  ~Prepared by Thomas C. Reeves, Ph.D.  1994(The sample screens below were taken from "Macintosh Fundamentals and Beyond," an award-winning training course from Apple Computer, Inc. developed in 1989.)Rule 1 - Show consideration for users by designing for "user friendliness." A critical factor of "user friendliness" is making your IMM program as clear and elegant as possible.  Although your program may include other media, text will continue to play a major role in most IMM programs.  Therefore considerable design effort should be made to assure that text is an effective and efficient component of the overall program.    Rule 2 - Use balance and symmetry.  Balance a menu or portion of text with graphics to focus the learners attention.  In the "Macintosh Fundamentals and Beyond" (MFB) course, each of the module menus employs a consistent menu structure and graphical layout.Rule 3 - Keep displays predictable and regular. Once a display structure is established, use it consistently.  There will be times when varying display structure will be appropriate, but any modification should be based upon instructional requirements rather than change for its own sake.  An easily understandable  structure is one of the most important components of a IMM course.  In MFB, all modules contained the same   five basic sections, and these were displayed using a consistent textual and graphical display.Rule 4 - Use the appropriate display rate.  	Produce visually pleasing arrangements of graphics and text that permit students to focus on the important points without strain or confusion.  Keep the length of text sections to relatively brief paragraphs that convey one main idea.   Generally, it is better to display all the text that will appear on a single screen at the same time.  In this way, the learner can decide what they want to read, skim, review, etc. in order to synthesize the content.   Rule 5 - Avoid the "electronic page-turner." Rather than provide all the content in a long linear stream, permit learners to direct their own learning.   This can be done by using menus that allow learners to select the order in which to consider topics.  Provide cues as to what has been completed and what remains to be done.  A "fresh" menu of options in the MFB co  urse is represented by unfilled "diamonds" next to the choices.  The diamonds are filled in as the learner progresses through the material.Rule 6 - Maintain unity and simplicity. There is research that supports "low density" as opposed to "high density" text in IMM.  Researchers eliminated more than 40% of the text in normal IMM displays, and student performance was held constant while the time for training was shortened!  Subject matter experts and especially instructional designers sometimes include too much detail when displaying content on the screen.  Provide the main ideas and a means of getting more information for those who might need or desire it.  Rule 7 - Create sensible groupings. Here are some guidelines for formatting groupings:	Use a bullet typographical character, if possible, or other character such as the tilde (`) or a hyphen (-).	Begin each item with a capital letter.	Set items f  lush left.	Omit punctuation marks to separate entries unless the entry is a sentence.  	End sentences with periods.	Arrange lists vertically and avoid using commas to mark separate items.	Keep overall density levels at 25 to 40 percent of the screen. Rule 8 - Place primary material at the upper left corner of the screen. 	In Western cultures, people tend to read from left to right and from top to bottom.  Place the title of a screen in the upper left hand corner so that learners perceive the main thrust of a screen right away.  (Note that in a series of screens, it is a good idea to provide learners with an idea of how many screens there are and where they are in the sequence.)  Rule 9 - Place prompts and locators consistently on screens.   	Navigation is a major challenge in any IMM program.  Place control options in consistent areas of the screen.  In MFB, the main  x control options are displayed in a black bar displayed on the right hand side of the screen.  Unique controls for specific screens are displayed in a prominent manner.  After an orientation and a little experience with a well-designed IMM program, the "cognitive demands" of the interface are reduced, and learners can focus on the content.  Rule 10 - Limit line length to 40 to 60 characters.  	Text lines longer than 60 characters are hard to read because the eye has to shift too wide a distance to read from line to line without losing place.  In MFB, text sometimes averaged 60 characters, but more often narrower lines of text were displayed, as illustrated on this screen.Rule 11 - Provide generous use of open space.  	Research has demonstrated that improvements in the use of white space increase ease of reading more than improvements in style.  Leaving blank l  oines between paragraphs helps.  Of course, it is important that screens contain important "chunks" of content .  Generally, research supports a screen density of 25 to 40 percent.   Rule 12 - Left-justify text, but do not right-justify it.   	When you right-justify text, the spaces interrupt eye movement and slow down reading.  Left-justification, however, supports the general tendencies of how Western learners read.  Rule 13 - Use mixed type sizes and styles to emphasize certain materials and provide variety.   	 Here are some guidelines for fonts:	Use lowercase and uppercase in text sections.	Consider all uppercase for emphasis in captions or labels, but realize that all uppercase letters generally reduce legibility and slow down reading.  	Serif type faces are slightly more legible than san serif when all other things are equal.  (This is a c  ontroversial issue.)Rule 14 - Organize complex information into tables.  	Just as a picture can be worth a thousand words, a table can summarize complex information in a manner that supports learning.  However, good tables are difficult to create.  It is generally not a good idea to display very complex tables in IMM, but simple tables can be quite effective.   Rule 15 - Emphasize with text attributes.  	Here are some guidelines for text attributes:	Use highlighting or boldface to draw attention to the main points.	Underlining rarely looks good on a IMM screen.	Blinking should only be used in critical situations.  It is distracting.	Vary the size and rotation of text to a  ttract attention.	Scrolling text is generally not sound practice in IMM.	Multiple fonts should rarely be used.  Pick a good font and work with its different styles.   Additional guidelines can be found in the following sources:Blattner, M. M., & Dannenberg, R. B. (Eds.). (1992).

      Text is an essential element of most interactive multimedia programs.  Text is so dominant in our world that it often over-looked in the design process.  Some programs appear as if the text has simply been slapped on the screen.  Text must be as carefully designed into interactive multimedia programs as any other elements (video, sound, graphics, etc.).  The Text Design Guidelines tool does not present hard and fast rules for text layout, but does illustrate practical recommendations that should be carefully considered.           

You should feel free to modify or expand the checklist as needed in your specific situation.  3.  An Assumptions Checklist appears on the following page.    ASSUMPTIONS CHECKLIST   This tool presumes that time has passed between the initial estimate of project scope and the approval to begin the project.Step 1: Meet with the client (or talk by phone)  and determine:   Are the goals and objectives still on target?    Is the audience still the same?    Is the content still the same?  (Review each proposed element.)  Are the plans for marketing the product (or implementing the program, or whatever) still the same?  What has changed?    Has the amount of money, resources, and/or time available for the development effort changed?   Does the client still support the development effort to the extent needed to provide necessary SMEs, documentation, and equipment?  Are implementation plans still the same?  (personnel, dates, locations, etc.?)Step 2: Review your estimates of project scope, including:  Materials required Time needed   Projec  t costs If you have been newly assigned to manage the project, have inherited a vague project plan, and there are no detailed records of planned materials, time, or costs, then you should create them at this point.Step 3: If necessary, rethink the project goals:If serious questions about project scope or other assumptions arise, don't hesitate to raise a red flag.  It is better to rethink the multimedia development project now than to have to cancel it later, after wasting valuable time and resources.Step 4: If necessary, reestimate project scope.Based on the results of the preceding steps, you may have to create new estimates of project scope (deliverables, time, costs).   You'll need these to be accurate and up-to-date.   The result of using this checklist should be with detailed, approved time line, budget, and project plan that justifies continued expenditures of time, money, and resources toward completing the multimedia design effort.       DSET       ( H       h   i                                    g 

    i  During the "Analysis" phase of a development effort, you and your team gradually constructed a set of assumptions about the interactive product you are developing.  It is sound practice to confirm those assumptions before undertaking the bulk of the design work for the product.  The assumptions should be confirmed with your client and with any vendors that may be collaborating on the project.  The "Assumptions Checklist" is a tool that can help you confirm the assumptions underlying your multimedia development effort.             

Your contracts must be legally and financially sound.  2.	A tool to help your establish sound vendor contracts appears on the next page.ESTABLISHING VENDOR CONTRACTS   After you have selected your vendor, you will need to complete some paperwork before the vendor becomes part of the project team.Here's an overview of the process:1.Negotiate the contract terms and conditions with the vendor.2.Prepare the contract and get it signed by legal office and the vendor.3.Establish Purchase Order and invoicing processes.4.Set up an e-mail account for the vendor, if appropriate.5.Obtain IDs for all vendor employees.Let's examine each of these in greater detail.____________________________________________________________1.  Negotiate the contract terms and conditions with the vendor.Negotiating the vendor contract involves two substeps:   Prepare for the negotiation.A contract is a written document that spells out what you a  nd your vendor have agreed upon regarding the services of the vendor and your responsibilities.  Typical subsections of a contract are:  Bidding  Costs and Equipment  Confidentiality Agreement  Access to Premises  Invoices  Communications  Reporting  Review and Acceptance of Work  Timeliness  Insurance Verification  Attendance at Meetings  Back-UpReview these guidelines, then review the vendor proposal to see if there will be major discrepancies.  If so, prepare to present your company's position to the vendor. Conduct the negotiation.Meet with the vendor,  review the issues, and obtain agreement.2.  Prepare the contract and get it signed by legal and the vendor. Obtain a sample contract fro  m your Finance office.     Review the sample contract and substitute the particular terms and conditions that fit your project as negotiated with the vendor. Present the completed contract to the vendor for approval.  Have the contract word-processed and proofed and then send it to your Legal department for approval.3.  Establish Purchase Order and invoicing processes.For details, see the Finance Dept. of your company.  4.  Set up an e-mail account for the vendor, if appropriate.Contemporary ID projects demand rapid exchange of electronic documents.  E-mail is essential.  5.  Obtain IDs for all vendor employees.If your company maintains security procedures, IDs will be required for the vendor employees.       DSET       ( H       h                                       g 

      During the production stage, it is frequently a wise strategy to contract out for certain services such as video production or audio editing.  If you contract out for any services, you are advised to prepare a carefully written "contract" that will protect you, your client, and the vendor as well.  This tool provides you with guidance and a template for "Establishing Vendor Contracts."            

Vendors typically try to respond, point by point, to your RFP when they make their proposals.  Therefore, the RFP "leads" vendors by focusing their attention on certain issues.  In addition, it shapes their first impressions of your training development group and the project to be completed.  Most importantly, the RFP is the foundation upon which the vendor's relationship with you is built.2.  For these reasons, the RFP must be carefully crafted and reviewed before distributing it to vendors.3.  This template below provides some suggestions for the contents of an RFP.REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL TEMPLATE   
A TYPICAL RFPThe typical RFP includes the following sections:I.  The General Training Goals This section includes the general business goals which are met by the new product or process on which the training will be based.  In addition, it describes the key   components of the new product or process (how it works) and compares these to existing products or processes with which vendors may be familiar.II.  The Target AudiencesThis includes brief summaries of the jobs of the people who are to be trained.  Both primary and secondary audiences, if any, should be described.  Include information on how their responsibilities will change as a result of the introduction of the new product or process.  Include also numbers of people to be trained, by job category and geographic location.III.  ObjectivesThis should describe exactly what the target audience will be required to do as a result of going through the training.  Each objective should be listed.IV.  Project DetailsThis section should include:__   Brief summaries of needs and task analyses, if any__   Brief summaries of content and suggested treatment, if applicable__   Description of anticipated project team organization, especially reporting 	           relationships among your team   and other players__   Description of your ultimate client__   Description of required development process and revision cycles__   Listing of expected deliverables, if appropriate__   Information on standards of quality and quantity V.  Constraints on Budget, Schedule, and DesignThis section should describe:  __   How much money may be spent with the vendor on this project (budget        boundaries)__   Specific dates for completion of milestones such as: the analysis*, design plans,        drafts, test sessions, master deliverables, and reproduced copies to the field__   Implementation plans (locations, dates, types and numbers of instructors, etc.)__   Constraints on the design such as a need to deliver the training in a self-study        format, on interactive videodisc, or whatever*This assumes that you are requesting that the vendor complete the analysis.  You might consider doing   the analysis yourself.VI.  Resources ProvidedThis section should describe the resources to be provided by you. Specifically, it should include a description of the subject matter experts, market research, technical documentation, equipment or facilities, and any other resources that will provided to the vendor during the development process.VII.  Criteria for Evaluating Success of the TrainingThis is a statement of specifically how the completed training will be judged by you and/or your client to be successful.  VIII.  Criteria for Selecting a VendorThis is a list of the criteria which will be used to determine the best vendor proposal.  Typical criteria include: vendor quality as evidenced in samples of work, vendor price, vendor's understanding of the product class (subject matter), track record within you, quality of proposed solution, creative use of media, and so  w on. If you intend to use a weighting method (for example, assign twice as much value to creative use of media as you assign to price) then describe this weighting system to the vendor. IX.  Requests for Vendor Suggestion or CreativityThis includes areas in which you are uncertain about the strategy and seek vendor recommendations.  It can also include areas in which you are flexible regarding design. Vendors are often experienced professionals who are capable of conceiving several creative alternatives.  However, if your RFP leaves the vendor with the impression that you have already locked in on a specific mode of instruction (self-study, driven by audio tape, for example), vendors are not likely to propose something drastically different.  After all, they want your business!Therefore, you should openly state those areas in which you are flexible or seek vendor   recommendations.X.  Terms and ConditionsAttach blank contract or spell out special conditions/requirements that vendors must meet.TEMPLATEYour Request for Proposal should contain all the parts listed below.  Check off those which are actually present:____I.The General Training Goals____II.The Target Audiences____III.Objectives____IV.Project Details Needs/Task Analysis Summary Content/Treatment Summary Team Organization Your Client Required Development Process Expected Deliverables Quality/Quantity Standards____V.Constraints on Budget, Schedule, Design Budget Boundaries Milestones Dates Implementation Plans Constraints on Design____VI.Resources Provided____VII.Criteria for Evaluating Success of the Training____VIII. Criteria for Selecting a Vendor____IX.Requests for Vendor Suggestions/Creativity____X.Terms and Conditions     DSET       ( H       h                                       g 

    P  Expert review is one of the primary evaluation strategies used in both formative (How can this multimedia program be improved?) and summative (What is the effectiveness and worth of this multimedia program?) evaluation.  It is often a good idea to provide experts with some sort of instrument or guide to insure that they critique all of the important aspects of the IMM program that you want reviewed.  This "Expert Review Checklist" has been designed for use by an instructional design expert.  You would employ different sorts of Expert Review Checklists with different types of experts such as a content expert or a human computer interface expert.          

<H2>Experience Summary
</H2><P>Larry Najjar attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester,
Massachusetts. He graduated with a BS in psychology in 1980. In 1983, he
was awarded an MS in engineering psychology from the Georgia Institute of
Technology in Atlanta, Georgia.
<P>After graduating, Larry worked for Systems Research Laboratories in Hanover,
Maryland. He designed the software and hardware user-interface for an advanced
word processing and audio transcription work station. In 1984, he joined
the IBM Corporation in Rockville, Maryland. Larry helped design the
user-interface for the next-generation US air traffic control system, including
the digital flight strips, keyboard, work station, and user warnings. In
1989, he transferred to Atlanta, Georgia, where he designed and tested
user-interfaces for a wide variety of commercial applicatons.
<P>Larry left IBM in 1993 to pursue his PhD in engineering psychology at
the Georgia Institute of Technology. He is currently a graduate research
assistant at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. He performed task and function
analyses, wrote training materials, prototyped user-interfaces, and wrote
on-line help. In his current assignment, he is working on a team to design
and build a multimedia
<A 
HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/EPSS/">electronic performance support system and a wearable
computer</A>.  For his dissertation, Larry plans to examine the effects of multimedia
user-interfaces on learning.

As a participant in an interactive multimedia design project, you will observe incidents or listen to reports of incidents which relate to the development and impact of the program.  It is important that this kind of anecdotal information be systematically recorded so that the story of the development and outcomes of this project can be understood.  Therefore, you should complete an Anecdotal Record Form whenever you witness or hear of a significant incident relating to the progress and accomplishments of project.  An anecdotal record is a verbal account which exhibits these characteristics:a.	Each anecdote should be limit  yed to a single incident.b.	It should contain a factual, non-inferential description of the observed or reported incident.  (For example, "The trainees said 'I've never enjoyed using a computer before.' " instead of "The trainee expressed satisfaction with the training system.")c.	It should include a description of the situation in which the incident occurs so that the meaning of the behavior can be understood.  d.	It should be written as soon as possible after witnessing or hearing about the incident so that all important details can be included.e.	It should include a separate section describing your interpretation of or feelings about the anecdote.  Your personal evaluation is important because 	your judgments about the project are valued highly.  2.  A copy of a blank Anecdotal Record Form as well as a sample completed form appears below.BLANK ANECDOTAL RECORD FORM    DATE:    __________                                                           PLACE:    _______      NAME OF OBSERVER:        ___________            Description of the incident:     .Interpretation:  SAMPLE ANECDOT  AL RECORD FORM DATE:    July 23, 1992                                                           PLACE:    Beta Site 2      NAME OF OBSERVER:        Lucy Schweitzer            Description of the incident:  About two hours into the course, one of the trainees suddenly got up and left the class.  I followed him out into the hall and asked if anything was wrong.  He replied: "I can't waste my time sitting in the class because I don't intend to use the new system."  I asked him why and he answered:  "Computers don't work for me.  As soon as I touch one, the program blows up.  You'll be glad I won't use your system because it would just fall apart if I did.  It's nothing against you or your course, I just know it won't work."I tried to talk to him more, but he indicate  d that he had to make some phone calls and left.Interpretation:  The "(Insert name here.)" course training  is innovative and user-friendly in our eyes, but in the eyes of a person with high anxiety about technology, it is just another threatening computer program.  I suspect that this person strongly fears computers and that he has an unusually strong degree of "learned helplessness" with respect to them.  It may be worthwhile to conduct some sort of a pre-assessment with respect to "techno-phobia" and makes special efforts to help those who express high anxiety.  Also, this person indicated before the beginning of the course that he was only there because his boss insisted that he attend.  We may need to clarify the enrollment procedures for this and other clients.     DSET       ( H       h                                       g 

      Evaluation data does not have to be reported as "cold hard statistics."  Often you will want to tell the "human story" involved in your development or implementation project.  One way of capturing those important stories and critical incidents that provide the human story is the "Anecdotal Record Form."  Participants in an interactive multimedia design project can use this instrument to describe a noteworthy event and to offer their own interpretation of its relevance.  It is very important to try to complete an Anecdotal Record Form as soon as possible after a critical event has occurred so as not to forget critical information.  It is equally important to separate your description of the incident from your interpretation of it!            

Otherwise, you may be paying too much or miss out on the good deals provided by start-up companies.  2.	A Plan for Bidders Session appears on the next page.PLAN FOR BIDDERS SESSION   A bidder's session is a meeting in which you present all potential vendors with your Request for Proposal (RFP).  The bidder's session can help you concentrate all your question and answer time into one efficient meeting.  In this way all the vendors get the same "party line" regarding the required training.This tool will help you plan and conduct the bidder's session.   (This tool assumes you have completed your RFP.  See the tool, "Request for Proposal Template".)Complete the following steps to plan and conduct the bidder's information session._________________________________________________________Step 1:  Plan the bidder's session.A. Contact several vendors by phone and then send a follow-up letter and explain, briefly, the time and place of the session. Expect to spend no more than two hours.   In this time, you will present vendors with the RFP and answer questions.     Obtain a closed conference room for the meeting, with refreshments if desired. In the first letter and phone call, be careful to disclose no confidential information and do not give one vendor more information than another. B. Invite your supervisor or client to attend the meeting if you anticipate vendor questions which would require their response. C. Get together the following:   Copies of the RFP Any presentation materials which might be useful in explaining the subject of the training(System flow diagrams, "exploded diagrams" of components, and other visuals can help vendors become familiar with the product or process quickly.)   Non-disclosure agreements for all vendors___________________________________________________________Step 2:  Assemble at least two vendors and conduct the bidder's information session.At the session, be sure to: Make all   vendors sign the non-disclosure agreement before discussing details of the product/process or the course.  Provide each vendor with the RFP and point out the deadline for response. Review the RFP, focusing on controversial or potentially difficult topics. Highlight the "Constraints on budget, schedule, and design" section of parameters. Explain and justify to vendors the development model you are using. Especially discuss how this process affects vendor deliverables, review and approval points, and vendor payment. Answer vendor questions. Take care to provide all vendors with the same information.  This means that if a vendor comes up when the session is formally concluded, (as often happens) and asks you about a critical piece of information that you forgot to mention, you should make sure all vendors get this information before they begin work on their proposals.     DSET       ( H       h                                       g 

      When contracting out for services, it is financially wise to ask for bids from several different vendors to assure that you get the best value for your money.  A "Bidders' Session" is often held to provide potential vendors with the "Request for Proposal" (RFP) related to the services you require.  The "Bidders' Session" allows the vendors to seek clarifications concerning the RFP before they submit their bids.              

      The "Formative Review Log" is a simple instrument that can be used by anyone you have asked to review your program in its formative stages.  The instrument has three columns, the first for recording the screen or format sheet number that the person is reviewing, the second for writing down observations (e.g., errors, confusing points, or ideas), and the third for recording what actions have been taken in reaction to the feedback provided by members of the project team.  Using an instrument like this with many different types of users will probably have the greatest pay-off for formative evaluation throughout the life of the project.           

You should modify it as needed for your distinct purposes.  2.  Using an focus group is a type of survey activity.  Conducting a survey should be done systematically.  The overall steps in the survey process are:a.	Organize the survey team.b.	Determine the survey goal.c.	Select a representative sample.d.	Generate the questions.e.	Construct the instrument (questionnaire, interview protocol, or 		focus group protocol).f.	Test the instrument.g.	Administer the instrument.h.	Analyze the d  fata.i.	Share and use the results.  3.  Consider collecting evaluation data with more than one method if time and resources allow.  For example, a questionnaire can be used to collect information about global reactions to an interactive multimedia program.  Then, either interviews or focus groups can be used to collect more detailed information.  Alternatively, interviews or focus groups might be used to identify the most important evaluation issues that will be included in a questionnaire sent to many people.4.  A sample focus group protocol begins on the next page.   EVALUATION FOCUS GROUP PROTOCOL    # of participants: _____________________          Host: __________________   Date: __________                                                     Site: __________1. 	  What is your opinion of the interactive multimedia system used to deliver this information?2.

However, focus groups need to be carefully planned so that you get the kind and quality of information you are seeking.  This "Focus Group Protocol" is a brief example of a list of questions that might be addressed during a focus group regarding an interactive multimedia program.           

Your sign-off form should contain the following sections:	A title referring to what it is you want the client to sign-off on, e.g., design plan, screen design specifications, etc.	A reference to the project on which you are working.	A description of what is being signed-off on, including a listing of what has been reviewed and a statement concerning how further changes might be handled once the form has been signed.  (Permission to invoice the client for milestones or tasks accomplished might also be included in the description.)	Spaces for signing and   dating the form by both the client and a representative of the design team.2.	Keep copies of the sign-off forms for major project accomplishments in the project notebook or diary.  (It is a good idea to provide the client with a copy as well.)3.	Use some type of sign-off form for all the major milestones or products generated during a project, but dont force the client to sign-off on every little aspect of the project.  There has to be some middle ground.  4.	A sample sign-off form appears on the next page.APPROVAL OF DESIGN PLANS Project:  The Sales Representatives Guide to the New Sales StrategiesI have reviewed and approved the Design Plans for the interactive multimedia course named above, with changes, additions, deletions or corrections as annotated   in the instructional designer's master copy.I hereby give you approval to proceed with creating the drafts of all workbooks, scripts, and other course materials.  I also give my approval for you to invoice my department for satisfactory completion of the Design Plans milestone of this project.I understand that further changes to the structure, objectives, or content of the course (aside from those specified in the designer's master copy) will likely result in a delay in the final delivery date and could result in additional charges to my department and/or costs to The Company. __________________________            	_____________             [signature]               	                               [date]J.

      The "Sign-Off Form" is an exceptionally useful project management tool, especially when one is working for an external client.  Getting the client to sign-off on every interim product in the development of an interactive multimedia project will provide you with a solid basis for asking for additional resources (time, money, or people) that may be needed when the client wishes to change the program at some late date in the project.          

The ten criteria used in the User Interface Rating Form are explained in detail at the end of the instrument itself.  3.	  Some criteria may not be relevant in every IMM program.  User Interface Rating Tool for Interactive Multimedia 1993 Thomas C. Reeves, Ph.D. & Stephen W. Harmon, Ed.D.Instructions:  For each of ten user interface dimensions illustrated below, rate the program you have reviewed on a one to ten scale by circling the appropriate number under the dimension.  (Accompanying this tool are definitions for each of the ten user interface dimensions.)  Please add any comments that may help to clarify or explain your rating.  If a specific dimension does not seem appropriate to the interactive program you are reviewing, do not circle any numbers on the scale for that dimension and add a brief comment to explain your response.     Please add other comments related to the user interface of this program below:Definitions for User Interface Rating ToolUser Interface Dim  {ension 1  Ease of Use"Ease of Use" is concerned with the perceived facility with which a user interacts with an interactive multimedia program.  Figure 1 illustrates a dimension of such a program ranging from the perception that the program is very difficult to use to one that is perceived as being very easy to use.  Like many of the dimensions described in this tool, ease of use is both an aggregate and individual dimension.  For example, in the aggregate sense, the Windows interface is generally perceived as easier to use than the command interface of the Microsoft disk operating system (MS DOS).  However, in the individual sense, some people may perceive the MS-DOS interface to be easier to use because of their own unique experiences and attributes.  Figure 1.  "Ease of Use" dimension of user interface.  User interface dimensions may be highly correlated with how we  ll users enjoy using a specific program.  Whether users like a program may be more or less important, depending on the intent of the program and the context for its use.  Certainly, not liking an interactive program that is intended to be highly motivating is a major problem, whereas users' affect for a program may be less important in a training context in which strong extrinsic motivational factors exist.  Nonetheless, in the long run, improving the user interface dimensions of multimedia, such as "ease of use," is a highly desirable goal, regardless of context.  User Interface Dimension 2  Navigation"Navigation" is concerned with the perceived ability to move through the contents of an interactive program in an intentional manner.  Figure 2 illustrates a dimension of interactive multimedia ranging from the perception that a program is difficult to navigate to one that is perceived as bein  g easy to navigate.  An important aspect of navigation is orientation, i.e., the degree to which a user feels that he/she knows where he/she is in a program and how to go to another part of it.  This is a critical variable because users frequently complain of being lost in a interactive program (Utting & Yankelovitch, 1989).  Designers use several ways of supporting navigation and maintaining orientation.  A popular approach to navigation is the WIMP (window-icons-mouse-pointing) interface. Figure 2.  "Navigation" dimension of user interface.   User Interface Dimension 3  Cognitive LoadUsing an interactive program requires different mental efforts than performing tasks via print or other media.  In order to make any meaningful response to an interactive program, users must cope with and integrate at least three cognitive loads or demands, i.e., (a) the content of the program, (b) its structure, and (c)   the response options available.  To use interactive programs, users must perceive options, conceptualize a choice, and make some physical action, all while mentally coordinating the demands of these three cognitive loads.  The user interface is the vehicle that allows perceptual, conceptual, and physical contacts with the interactive program.  In terms of "cognitive load," the user interface can seem unmanageable (i.e., confusing) at one end of the continuum and easily manageable (i.e., intuitive) at the other end (see Figure 3).    Figure 3.  "Cognitive Load" dimension of user interface.  Learners acquire and structure information delivered via interfaces, conduct mental operations, and accomplish physical activities during their interactions with interactive multimedia.  The limited capacity of working memory to hold only five to nine chunks of information simultaneously makes it difficult for users of complexit  y structured programs to reason when numerous cognitive load factors must be handled simultaneously.  Users may feel overwhelmed by numerous options that increase the cognitive load.  The risks of confusion are especially high when users confront programs which by their very nature include many interactive options.  The possibility of user disorientation is a major concern in the increasingly popular multimedia programs that feature a complex, flexible structure.   User Interface Dimension 4  Mapping"Mapping" refers to the programs ability to track and graphically represent to the user his or her path through the program.  In complex, non-linear programs, user-disorientation can be alleviated if users can see what parts of the system they have already accessed.  Utting and Yankelovitch (1989) discuss user disorientation as referring to, among other things, the users not knowing the boundaries of the information spa  ce.  Having a detailed mapping system gives users an aid in understanding which parts and how much of the information space they have interacted with, and conversely which parts and how much of it they havent.  Interactive programs fall in a continuum of containing no mapping function to an appropriately powerful mapping function (see Figure 4).Figure 4.  "Mapping" dimension of user interface.  The notion of an "appropriately powerful" mapping function requires some explanation.  Just as it is important to possess a map of the most usable scale when taking a road trip, it is important for interactive programs to provide enough, but not too much, detail in showing user paths.  A map that shows every piece of a program's knowledge space might prove to be so tedious or unwieldy as to be of as little value as an interactive program with no map.User Interface Dimension 5  Screen Design"Screen Design" is a particularly c  omplex dimension of interactive programs that can easily be broken down into many sub-dimensions related to text, icons, graphics, color, and other visual aspects of interactive programs.  Shneiderman (1987) maintains that although certain design principles have been established, "screen design will always have elements of art and require invention" (p. 326).  A separate dimension has been defined to deal with the artistic aspects of interactive programs (see Dimension 9 - Aesthetics below).  We define "screen design" as a dimension ranging from substantial violations of principles of screen design to general adherence to principles of screen design (see Figure 5).    Figure 5.  "Screen Design" dimension of user interface.   There are two problems with this dimension.  First, screen design principles have not kept up with the rapidly changing nature of interactive technology.  Second, creative designers may sometimes intentionally v  iolate screen design principles for effect or to otherwise focus the user's attention.  Nonetheless, we think that there exists enough knowledge about the principles of screen design that people, particularly experienced designers, can make meaningful distinctions among poorly and well designed screens in interactive programs.User Interface Dimension 6  Knowledge Space Compatibility"Knowledge space" refers to the network of concepts and relationships that compose the mental schema a user possesses about a given phenomena, topic or process.  Subject matter experts and/or designers of interactive programs are generally perceived as possessing an expert knowledge space with respect to the content included in the programs they create.  This expertise usually is the basis for the structure of the knowledge or information presented in a program.  Novice users, on the other hand, often possess an inadequate knowledge space with respect to the content of a   program.  The knowledge space of novices may be inadequate because of ignorance, misconceptions, or some blending of ignorance and misconceptions.  When a novice user initiates a search for information in an interactive program, the interface should be powerful enough so that the user perceives the resulting information as compatible with his or her current knowledge space (see Figure 6).  If the information received is not perceived as relevant to the search strategies used by the user, the system will be perceived as incompatible.  Figure 6.  "Knowledge Space Compatibility" dimension of user interface.   Admittedly, this is a very difficult dimension to judge.  However, if a user initiates a search for information about a topic, e.g., the procedures for installing new software, the resulting information should seem compatible with that search once the information is thoroughly explored.  If the information seems arbitrary or irrelevant   to the search that was initiated, the knowledge space representation should be judged as incompatible.   User Interface Dimension 7  Information PresentationThe "Information Presentation" dimension is concerned with whether the information contained in the knowledge space of an interactive program is presented in an understandable form.  The most elegantly designed user interface for an interactive  program is useless if the information it is intended to present is incomprehensible to the user.  Certainly the user might be able to find all of the information about a subject, but whether the user could then comprehend, understand, or learn that information is another matter.  Imagine a complicated installation procedure presented in textual form, written in a stream of consciousness style reminiscent of James Joyces Ulysses.  Or consider a video presentation on sales techniques for ATMs, directed and produced by Andy Warhol.  In each   case the information requisite for understanding may be present, but would probably be difficult if not impossible to comprehend.  Information presentation is defined as a dimension ranging from obtuse to clear (see Figure 7).Figure 7.  "Information Presentation" dimension of user interface.   User Interface Dimension 8  Media IntegrationThe most important aspect of the media integration dimension refers to how well an interactive program combines different media to produce an effective whole.  Do the various media (text, graphics, audio, video, etc.) work together to form one cohesive program, or is the program a hodgepodge of gratuitous media segments?  Are the various media components necessary to the function of the program or would the program function equally as well without them?  The media integration dimension is defined as ranging from uncoordinated to coordinated (see Figure 8). Figure 8.  "Media Integratio  n" dimension of user interface.   User Interface Dimension 9  Aesthetics"Aesthetics" refers to the artistic aspects of interactive programs in the sense of possessing beauty or elegance.  In the aggregate sense, many people may praise the aesthetics of an automobile design or the elegance of a bridal gown.  However, in an individual sense, aesthetics are highly unique and one person's sense of the beautiful may seem grotesque to another.  Eisner (1985) described the need to develop "connoisseurs" in evaluation of education and training, just as we have connoisseurs in the arts.  Connoisseurs have refined tastes and a deep sensitivity to aesthetics that enable them to criticize phenomena (e.g., plays, paintings, musical scores, or interactive programs) in a manner that can be communicated to others.  In turn, other people, perhaps less refined and less sensitive, may become more informed by "consuming" the expert reviews pro  vided by the connoisseurs.  In the absence of such connoisseurs, the aesthetics dimension of the user interface of an interactive multimedia program is defined as ranging from displeasing to pleasing (see Figure 9).  Figure 9.  "Aesthetics" dimension of user interface.   User Interface Dimension 10  Overall Functionality"Overall Functionality" is an aspect of interactive multimedia programs related to the perceived utility of the program.  The perceived functionality of an interactive program is obviously highly related to the intended use of the program.  A given program may have multiple uses.  Its overall functionality must be judged in relation to the specific intended use that exists in the mind of the users.  Figure 10 illustrates a dimension of the user interface of interactive programs that ranges from dysfunctional to highly functional.  Figure 10.  "Overall Functionality" dimension of user interface.       DSET   |    ( H       	     pp                                                   x          l        6    *                                                      x             x        d WORD   "       

    w  wThe "User Interface" of an interactive instructional product, e.g, a multimedia program, is a critical element of the product that must be carefully evaluated.  If the user interface is not well-designed, learners will have little opportunity to learn from the program.  This rating form includes ten major criteria for assessing the user interface for an interactive program, such as "ease of use" and "screen design."  Not all of the criteria may be relevant to the particular program you are evaluating, but most of them will.  You may need to add additional criteria to the list.  Novice users of interactive instructional products are generally not good candidates for using this form.  The people rating the user interface should be experienced users of the type of program you are asking them to rate.  Even better, they could be experienced designers of interactive programs.            

<h2>CHI Workshop on Research Issues in Wearable Computers</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3>
March 23, 24, 1997
<br>
Atlanta, Georgia  USA
</h3>

<b>
Initial submissions due by January 15, 1997

<br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Wearable computers are becoming more common. A recent workshop on wearable
computing in Seattle attracted more than 200 attendees. For the most part,
however, wearable computers are being treated as small computers with attempts
to provide the same range of input and output devices as on a desktop and to
utilize the same applications. We believe, however, that wearable computing is
a new paradigm introducing new issues. It is not just mobile desktop
computing. The purpose of this workshop is to discuss this position and to
identify those research issues that are specific to wearable computers. The
goal of the workshop is to produce a white paper identifying research issues
in wearable computing and we expect this white paper to be seminal in the
oncoming era of wearable computing.
<p>
The advent of mobile computing made it possible to carry a personal computing
environment in a briefcase or a pocket.  These devices fall short, however, of
allowing an individual to use the power of a computer with no more thought
than they give to using a hammer or other tool. They do not provide the
ability to have a seamless interaction with the computer in the context of
performing other tasks. Wearable computers allow the wearer tetherless
mobility and the freedom to perform other activities while wearing it.
Wearable computers should require little or no infrastructure beyond what is
normally available in the environment. For example, a wireless infrastructure
is now (or soon will be) normally available but physical entities that
identify themselves through electronic means are not.
<h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
<p>
We expect our discussions to include topics such as:
<ul>
<li>What applications are appropriate for wearable computers
<li>What input modalities are appropriate for these applications
<li>What output devices are necessary to support these applications
<li>What are the software requirements for these applications both at the operating system level and at the application software level
<li>What are the social ramifications when one or both participants are wearing a computer
<li>How is collaboration facilitated or inhibited when one of the participants is wearing a computer 
<li>What user interface paradigms are appropriate for wearable computers
<li>What are the system aspects of wearable computers
</ul>
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>
Participation in the workshop will be based on the submission of a 
position paper articulating your views on one of the above issues or on some
other relevant issue.  Participation will be limited to 30 attendees. If you are currently
involved in wearable computing research and are interested in participating in
this workshop, you are invited to submit a position paper.  Send a three page position paper electronically to 
ljb@sei.cmu.edu by January 15, 1997. Submitters will be notified of their
acceptance by Febuary 15. All participants must register for the CHI conference.
<h3>Workshop Activities</h3>
<p>
The workshop will be a two day workshop. The first day will be devoted to
presentations. The actual breakdown into groups will be based on the
submitted position papers.  We our planning a division into the four categories
of input/output devices, applications, user interface paradigms and CSCW and
social ramifications.
<p>
The number of presentations will be limited to those that can be given on the
first day. Therefore, not all attendees will be invited to present position
papers.
<p>
The second day of the workshop will be devoted to discussing the issues raised
on the first day. The goal of these discussions is to define and clarify these
issues.
<h3>Output of Workshop</h3>
<p>
The output of the workshop is going to be a white paper that will be
disseminated widely. It will be published in the SIGCHI Bulletin as well as
other outlets.  There is a wearable web page in which we will include the
white paper. The organizers of this workshop are also involved in organizing a
<A HREF="http://mime1.marc.gatech.edu/wearcon/">broader conference on wearable computing</A>
  and the issues raised in the white
paper will be disseminated at that conference.
