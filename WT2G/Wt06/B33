The study was a joint project of the Center for Policy Alternatives and Who Cares magazine. It finds that the young are concerned, realistic, risk-oriented, and visionary. Most have jobs, some are starting families. Most are looking to the future.<br><br><LI><strong>Last international UN conference of the century scheduled</strong> (Friday, 5/31/96)<br>The United Nations will hold an international conference on human settlements next week in Istanbul. As many as 25,000 delegates from 185 countries will be in attendance. One of the biggest arguments will be over whether housing should be declared a human right. A recent UN report says that about 100 million people are homeless, most of them women and children.<br><br><LI><strong>The Boris manifesto</strong> (Friday, 5/31/96)<br><b>Reuters</b> reports that Russian president and presidential candidate Boris Yeltsin has issued a 127-page document outlining his plans for the country, if he is re-elected. Among other things, he calls for fair wages, secure jobs, and pension plans by the year 2000. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov is challenging Yelsin in the June 16 election, and it appears very close. The Russian election, plus the recent ones in Israel and India have been among the more closely watched and may have greater implications than the American presidential election scheduled for November. The American candidates, Clinton and Dole, appear quite similar on many issues, despite efforts to contrast themselves with the opponent. <br><br><LI><strong>Walesa gets pension</strong> (Thursday, 5/30/96)<br>The Polish parliament approves <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960530/news/stories/walesa_1.html">lifetime pension</A> for ex-presidents, including Lech Walesa.

Politicians seem to be <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960529/politics/stories/affirmative_3.html">deciding against emphasizing it</A>, even though a California proposition could end preferences, according to <b>Reuters</b>. <br><br><LI><strong>More on the minimum wage issue in Germany</strong> (Thursday, 5/30/96)<br>German construction unions want a minimum wage for construction workers in order to protect German workers from less expensive foreigner workers from other parts of the European Union. Now, the Social Democratic party supports the move, reports <b>Sueddeutsche Zeitung</b> this morning. <br><br><LI><strong>Help in breaking the news</strong> (Thursday, 5/30/96)<br>Some employers haven't been all that sensitive or discrete in telling people their jobs have vaporized, so some are looking for outside help. The <A HREF="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/article/rootEval.cgi?currentStory=10001243">Minneapolis Star Tribune</A> tells about "firing squads" for hire. <br><br><LI><strong>New version of haves and have-nots</strong> (Thursday, 5/30/96)<br>Guest columnist Lyle Wray writes about the "silicon curtain" that can <A HREF="http://www.pioneerplanet.com/opinion/columns/">shut the poor out</A> of the new economy. You can read his column on the web, if you're a <b>St. Paul Pioneer Press</b> web site subscriber. Rory J. O'Connor, writing in the <b>San Jose Mercury News</b> writes about Africa's growing isolation from the information highway and problems associated with trying to get the continent connected. An underdeveloped telecommunications system is only part of the problem.<br><br><LI><strong>Workers strike in Belgrade</strong> (Thursday, 5/30/96)<br><b>Reuters</b> reports that about 1,000 court employees and health workers demonstrated Tuesday in Belgrade in an effort to pay and working condition improvements. <br><br><LI><strong>Local business tries to take up slack</strong> (Thursday, 5/30/96)<br>Jim Carnal, in the <b>Bakersfield Californian</b>, reports that local businesses in Bakersfield are trying to help after a 25% reduction in funding for the federal summer jobs program for disadvantaged young people. The federal program has been popular for thirty years, but budget balancing efforts in Washington nearly eliminated it altogether. <br><br><LI><strong>Police march in Paris</strong> (Thursday, 5/30/96)<br>Thousands of police officers marched in Paris yesterday to protest feared job losses, decline in financial support, and a rapidly increasing suicide rate that they say stems from stress and frustration. Traditionally, police have been unpopular with the general public in France. <b>Reuters</b> and other services are reporting the story. <br><br><LI><strong>Wellesley College loses harassment suit</strong> (Thursday, 5/30/96)<br>The <b>Boston Globe</b> reports that Hillary Rodham Clinton's alma mater has lost a sexual harassment suit and has settled a sexual discrimination suit out of court. Wellesley has been a leader on feminist and gender-related issues. <br><br><LI><strong>Clinton retreats a bit</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>In a sign that the Clinton Administration may finally get its left and right hands connected to the same nervous system, Attorney Robert Bennett, who is representing the President in the sexual harassment suit brought against him by a former worker in Arkansas, has filed a new brief with the Supreme Court. This time, <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960528/politics/stories/harassment_2.html">they won't invoke</A> the 1940 Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act to prevent the President from having to defend himself in a civil suit while on "active duty" as Commander in Chief of the American armed forces. Republicans have grabbed this "gift" to re-energize Robert Dole's campaign and to point out that, while Dole was gravely injured on active duty during the Second World War, Clinton did not serve in Vietnam. In the "small world" department, attorney Robert Bennett, who was critical of the Republicans in a statement, is the brother of Republican William Bennett, former official and author of <b>The Book of Virtues</b> and other critiques of what he regards as the moral decline presided over by liberal Democrats and symbolized by Clinton. Got all that? If it all makes sense, please explain it to us. We suspect they may still be using lead water pipes in Washington, at least in the government buildings.<br><br><LI><strong>Reinterpretation of academic symbols accelerates</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>The <b>New York Times</b> reports that some who qualify for <A HREF="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/article/rootEval.cgi?currentStory=10000573">Phi Beta Kappa</A> recognition are declining because they're not interested or even because they don't feel that it's worth the $30-$50 membership fee. We've been saying for some time that higher education institutions are beginning to decompose so rapidly in part because they see themselves as largely in the business of "selling degrees," and the degree is a social construction. The value depends on people's perceptions, and we are in a transformational period when perceptions of most things are altering rapidly. This process is rapidly influencing the perceived value of the Ph.D. degree as well, which has been a major fad in American society for several decades. The first American Ph.D. was awarded at Yale in 1861, so the country managed to get through most of its first 100 years without a single one.<br><br><LI><strong>High-level skills may be the key</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>The <b>St. Paul Pioneer Press</b> says that the ability of the Twin Cities area to <A HREF="http://www.pioneerplanet.com/business/">attract new jobs</A> may depend on one of the same things important in other areas.<br><br><LI><strong>More evidence of food crisis in North Korea</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>Representative Bill Richardson has returned from North Korea with more on the <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960529/international/stories/korea_4.html">prospect of famine</A> in parts of the country. The fighter pilot of defected to the south several days ago says North Korea is ready to attack South Korea. The UN reports on major food problems <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960529/international/stories/food_1.html">in Africa</A> as well. <br><br><LI><strong>Bankruptcies may set record</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br><b>Reuters</b> reports that both personal and business bankruptcies are <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960529/business/stories/bankruptcies_1.htm">way up</A>. <br><br><LI><strong>Vienna health care benefits cut</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br><b>Wiener Zeitung</b> reports today that Vienna will cut long-term health-care benefits from 78 weeks to 26 weeks in order to cope with a mounting deficit. <b>Der Standard</b> reports that Austria's state railway, Oesterreichische Bundesbahn, will force as many as 2,000 workers to retire early in order to cope with its deficit. Finally, according to <b>Kurier</b>, Austrian Civil Servant Secretary Kark Schloegl wants to double the number of workers in the Austrian Central Statistics Office in order to help in the changeover to international standards. There has been considerable criticism of the office recently for inaccuracy and slow response, as well as some calls to reduce the number of workers. <br><br><LI><strong>Bank employees want shorter work week</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>An organization of Swiss bank employees want the work week reduced to 36 hours. This and similar movements in European countries are mostly intended as a way of coping with high unemployment by encouraging "job sharing." <b>Tages Anzeiger</b> has the story this morning. <br><br><LI><strong>Italian transport minister wants new strike regulation</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>Claudio Burlando, Italy's new Transport Minister, wants to restrict train and air travel workers' right to strike, according to <b>Corriere della Sera</b>.<br><br><LI><strong>German government says no to minimum wage</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br><b>Frankfurter Allgemeine</b> reports that Germany's government has reject a union demand for a minimum wage for the country's construction workers in order to block the flow of less expensive foreign labor from other European Union countries. <br><br><LI><strong>More Japanese pensions money to go into stocks</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>According to <b>Nihon Keizai</b>, Japanese trust banks will put more of the pension funds they manage into stocks, because they expect the recovering Japanese economy will lead to rising stock prices. In the United States, pension funds are heavily invested in stocks, and, as a consequence, provide a major portion of the financing for American public corporations. Traditionally, in Japan, more business financing has come from large bank loans. <br><br><LI><strong>More on minimum wage issues</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>Julie Appleby, in the <b>Contra Costa Times</b>, outlines some of the economic arguments for and against the minimum wage increase. A study conducted by the Employment Policies Institute predicts the loss of more than 63,000 low-wage jobs in California if the increase becomes law. However, last year 101 economists, including several Nobel Prize winners, signed a statement supporting the increase. It reminds of Harry Truman's remark that he would like to have a "one-handed economist" who would not keeping saying, "but on the other hand..." One thing seems relatively clear: according to polls, the overwhelming majority of Americans are in favor of it, so, in a democracy, this should mean passage without difficulty, right? This is an election year, and nothing is easy in an election year.<br><br><LI><strong>Big struggle for aerospace jobs</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>In the <b>The Sacramento Bee</b>, Les Blumenthal writes about the worldwide struggle for control of the aerospace industry. He tells about the Boeing plant in Nagoya, Japan where the new 777 is being built with only a handful of workers, at least human workers. Robots are doing most of the assembly. Japan would like to make its own planes for the big international airline market, but so would South Korea, Taiwan, China and Indonesia, and others. It all makes U.S. aerospace workers very nervous. Jobs are being shipped overseas, critics say, but Boeing says they're simply trying to survive. Also, if robots are doing most of the work, the actual job loss to human workers elsewhere is less than it might be otherwise. The loss would be nearly as great if robots were building the planes in Seattle.<br><br><LI><strong>Jobs problem is worldwide</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>In a new report, the International Labour Organisation says that population in the world's cities is exploding and will result in social disaster next century if governments are unable to find ways to create far more new jobs. According to the UN agency, the problem is most desperate in developing countries, but is also looming over advanced economies including the United States and the European Union. The report is titled "The Future of Urban Employment." It reports that around 1950, there were only two metropolitan areas in the world with populations over 10 million. Now there are 14; by 2015, there will be 27. <b>Reuters</b> distributed this story worldwide. See our May 16 story on the population explosion. <br><br><LI><strong>An income of her own</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>Columnist Susana Barciela of the <b>Miami Herald</b> writes about a nonprofit program called "An Income of Her Own," which teaches teen girls about economic survival and how to dream big dreams. Entrepreneurial skills and attitudes are taught, as well as an understanding of the realities and risks of taking responsibility and following one's own dreams. The <A HREF=" http://www.herald.com ">Miami Herald</A> is on the web. <br><br><LI><strong>Top jobs mostly male, but with exceptions</strong> (Wednesday, 5/29/96)<br>Nancy Millman, in the <b>Chicago Tribune</b>, says that the chief executives of all Fortune 500 companies are still male, but there are women near the top in some companies, and <b>Working Woman</b> magazine has an article this time that speculates about who is most likely to break the sex barrier and become head of one of the nation's largest companies. Women have made heavy inroads as entrepreneurs, particularly in small business. Also, in the <b>Tribune</b>, Carol Kleiman writes that regulation of most labor-related issues of interest, including family issues, child labor, worker privacy, and so forth, is done at the state level, not the federal, and policies are highly variable. Kleiman also writes about Karen Swanson Murphy, who helped establish Flex Execs ManagementSolutions, a company that helps find suitable temporary replacements for people who are out under the Family and Medical Leave Act. You can find the <b>Chicago Tribune's</b> web site <A HREF="http://www.chicago.tribune.com">right here</A>.<br><br><LI><strong>Not big news, but worth remembering</strong> (Tuesday, 5/28/96)<br>L. M. Sixel, career writer for the <b>Houston Chronicle</b>, says one should examine interests and values when thinking about a career. For instance, if you've got big student loans to pay off, don't choose journalism, because starting salaries are the lowest in that field. How important are regular hours, security, and so on? Occupations vary tremendously in what they offer, and everybody has different priorities. Tom Baxter, of Houston Community College, says trying out different jobs for a year or so can be instructive. Colleges "inculcate a subtle disdain for work," he says. Incidentally, the low starting pay of journalists doesn't mean that all journalists are paid poorly. The mass media, including radio, television, print, and also the movies, tend to be tremendously competitive and "star-driven," to a significant extent. A small percentage of the talent makes a large percentage of the money, and no one enters these fields expecting to stay at the bottom. Of course, supply-demand relationships keep entry salaries low, because there is not a shortage of people who would like to become "stars." There might be plenty of applicants, even if they had to work for nothing. For example, some of the actors working feature films this year will earn $3,000 or less; others will get $20 million or more per appearance. Other occupations, on the other hand, offer far less income variability.

The <A HREF="http://www.chron.com">Houston Chronicle</A> is on the web, and you can find many of L. M. Sixel's career articles by doing a search on the paper's web site.<br><br><LI><strong>Teachers stop teaching in Mexico City</strong> (Tuesday, 5/28/96)<br><b>Reforma</b> reports that teachers have staged a 72-hour work strike after failing to each an agreement over salaries with the government.

Incidentally, according to public opinion polls, most Americans want the increase, but it continues to be controversial, not only among politicians, but also economists.

McCardell says that there is widespread opinion that if the situation is not resolved satisfactorily soon, the scale of protest could broaden considerably. Jock McCardell provides background on Australian higher education in the new economy in his Guest Commentary that is accessible through out Archives page. <br><br><LI><strong>UN study says 100 million homeless</strong> (Monday, 5/27/96)<br>Most of the world's homeless are <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960527/news/stories/women_1.html">women and children</A>, according to the United Nations, and there are about 100 million of them.

One of the more interesting issues requiring more research is how the tendency toward isolating workers from one another will affect morale. For instance, an increasing number of people are "telecommuting" or working out of their cars, rather than office space. Sales people, in particular, have been losing office space during recent years, now that technology makes it possible for them to do nearly everything they need to do with laptop computers, fax/modems and cellular phones, and so forth. <br><br><LI><strong>Unlikely coalition in tenure debate</strong> (Monday, 5/27/96)<br>The <b>Minneapolis Star Tribune</b> reports and the development of <A HREF="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/article/rootEval.cgi?currentStory=6460">strange alliances</A> in the ongoing debate over proposed changes in the University of Minnesota's tenure system. People who might not agree on anything else are finding it in their interest to cluster together on the tenure issue. Faculty voting on proposed changes will begin Thursday. The university wants to make it easier to lay off faculty when programs are eliminated, among other things. We expect similar debates to spread across much of academe during the next few years, as the restructuring process accelerates in higher education.<br><br><LI><strong>Guest columnist contrasts American, Japanese work relationships</strong> (Sunday, 5/26/96)<br>Kitty Eisele, guest columnist in the <b>St. Paul Pioneer Press</b> today, says that American employers will have to earn back trust. Eisele was among about forty professionals laid off by Minnesota Public Radio a year ago. Our Associate Editor, Teresa Callies, was one of her colleagues. See Teresa's opinion piece on our Guest Commentary page. Eisele's column is available on the <b>Pioneer Press</b> <A HREF="http://www.pioneerplanet.com/opinion/columns/index.htm">web site</A>, if you're a subscriber. Dave Beal's column this time tells of Robert Kuttner's speech to the annual meeting of the Minnesota Center for Corporate Responsibility. Kuttner sees a contradiction in business. On the one hand, a more entrepreneurial economy is supposed to be enriching to workers, but "the drive for shareholder enhancement means millions of Americans no longer have the benefit they cherish most: job security." Beal's column is also <A HREF=" http://www.pioneerplanet.com/business/index.htm ">available on the web</A>, if you're s subscriber. <br><br><LI><strong>Tightened employment practices in Hungary</strong> (Sunday, 5/26/96)<br>According to the <b>Hungary Report</b>, <b>Budapest Week</b> reports that the Hungarian government has issued a decree calling for tighter control over the content of employment contracts which applies to employers and employees, as well as foreign workers in the country. The decree also authorizes the National Labor Security and Labor Affairs Directorate to investigate discrimination complaints. The <b>Hungary Report</b> also says that International American Products (IAP) has denied that a woman has been sexually harassed at dining facilities in Taszar, but agreed that supervisors have not used good judgment when dealing with Hungarian employees. Finally, the publication reports that Hungary's high school graduates face a radically different job market now than only a few years ago. Today, employers want people who not only have university degrees, but also language and computer skills and skills readily applicable to the jobs they're applying for. A reluctance to invest heavily in training has caused companies in many countries to compete for persons who already have the specific skills necessary. The problem is compounded by the fact that many employers don't entirely trust educational institutions to prepare people adequately for their jobs.<br><br><LI><strong>Michigan Governor Engler attacks Clinton on welfare issue</strong> (Sunday, 5/26/96)<br>Governor John Engler says Clinton is "pandering" <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960525/news/stories/welfare_5.html">on welfare</A>.

There has been a consistent effort to encourage early retirement during recent years, often through the use of attractive incentives. However, this will screech to a halt for the baby boomers, according to Geewax. A lot of older boomers will be pushed out of good jobs, but they won't be offered early retirement packages providing anywhere near financial stability. Many will have to keep working on through their sixties and even into their seventies, because corporations will cut back dramatically on health care and pension payouts.

Before roughly 1840 (Lehigh says 1800), there were always fewer than 1 billion persons on the earth. In only a couple of centuries or so since, we have accumulated 5 times as many, and world population will reach 8 billion in only 30 years. This is a genuine explosion, in that the mathematics describing it are the mathematics of any explosion, including dynamite, which suggests a similar emergency. All efforts to solve the world's economic problems, whether they be attempted by corporations, governments, non-profit agencies, or individuals, will fail completely if we are unable to check world population growth within the few years immediately ahead. Moreover, it is a fantasy to assume that the entire world's population can achieve a consumption level equivalent to that of the United States (where 5% of the planet's people live) and a few other islands of prosperity, without bringing the world ecological system to a crashing conclusion. There have been stories in recent weeks about dramatically increasing grain prices because reserves have suddenly dwindled, in part because of weather conditions in the United States and, in part, because of dramatically increased demand for foodstuffs among increasingly prosperous portions of China's population. This is only one example of the increasing vulnerability of supporting conditions. Homo sapiens sapiens should not be smug about their success and invincibility, given that we've been around for only about 40,000 years. Dinosaurs dominated the earth for 100 million years, but not a single one has drawn breath for 165 million years. Similarly, our close cousins, the Neanderthals, thrived for about 60,000 years, and they are all gone.

However, about 300 former workers are suing Ceridian for age discrimination, which the company denies. The suit claims that older workers were targeted for layoff during the company's long restructuring process. The paper also quotes research indicating that wrongful termination claims have been increasing, and age discrimination claims are receiving the largest awards. The <b>Strib</b> also reports that Cray Research will lay off 118 workers because of the company's sale to California-based Silicon Graphics. Also, the print version of the paper today contains an editorial that discusses research in progress that suggests that overworking employees may not only be hard on them, but also counterproductive for the company. Multiple studies are indicating that more flexible work practices that allow more time for employees' private lives result in greater productivity, morale, and customer satisfaction. In general, these findings are consistent with many others over many years which large numbers of companies have chosen to ignore.

Hong Kong's Governor Patten expects <A HREF="http://www.hkstandard.com/online/news/001/hongkong/news008.htm">amazing things</A> if China keeps its promises. However, there is also widespread anxiety about political conditions in the colony once it's part of China. Many forecasters are predicting that China will have the world's largest economy by 2020. Given the tremendously high rates of development in some parts of the country, it should not be surprising if China's leadership is giving serious thought to extending Hong Kong's role following reversion. China is engaged in an historic experiment in which they are attempting to combine free-market capitalism with political totalitarianism while also trying to retain some of the communist ideology that helped unite the country fifty years ago. However, the fast growth regions of the country appear to be gaining some degree of political autonomy already, so the future may contain a range of possibilities. <br><br><LI><strong>G7 agrees that globalization a good thing</strong> (Saturday, 6/29/96)<br>Leaders of the world's 7 largest industrial economies have <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960629/news/stories/summit_4.html">issued a statement</A> in Lyon, France.

She said that in applying "just-in-time" principles to manufacturing has resulted in a cadre of just-in-time employees.

The unions remember four years ago when the city's mayor imposed contracts that are still widely resented. The city was nearly bankrupt at that time.

Some Democratic congresswomen want the EEOC to <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960627/politics/stories/mitsubishi_1.html">monitor Mitsubishi</A> closely, and <b>Nihon Keizai</b> says that American activist Jesse Jackson will meet with Mitsubishi's chairman next month to discuss the big sexual harassment case in the United States and to encourage the company to hire more minority workers. <b>Reuters</b> also reports that Ireland will use its 6-month presidency of the European Union to make the creation of jobs a top priority.<br><br><LI><strong>Job growth attributed to "lean and mean" policies</strong> (Friday, 6/28/96)<br>Mara Der Hovanesian, writing in Walnut Creek, California's <b>Contra Costa Times</b>, says that, despite corporate restructuring's impact on individuals and on the anxiety levels of many workers, it has contributed to phenomenal job growth in the United States.

Ordinarily, in American presidential elections, incumbent presidents tend to get credit for good economic times and blame for bad. This time, things are less certain, because, while the American economy is in the best shape in years according to many conventional indicators, polls indicate that there is also widespread economic insecurity. The Republicans must be assuming that popular perceptions will prevail, despite measurable realities. Of course, the historic structural changes, because they are historic, throw a new factor into the equation. <br><br><LI><strong>July 4 strike may or may not occur</strong> (Thursday, 6/27/96)<br>Belgium's <b>Le Soir</b> reports that unions are divided over whether to strike on July 4 at Usines Gustave Boel, the troubled Belgian steel company, as we reported yesterday.

If there is a serious loss of income, it will be much easier to weather the storm if there is no house payment. Otherwise, the unpleasant task of selling the house and seeking less expensive living accommodations without a fixed monthly rate may lie ahead.

This approach has been less tried in the United States. However, at the University of Minnesota, Duluth (UMD), while some jobs are being cut, other members of Teamsters Local 320 are having their hours reduced in order to share the pain and protect worker benefits. Reduced funding and on-going pressure on the university's budget have made the first layoffs in 20 years necessary, according to administrators. The university's principal campuses are located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region, 140 miles to the south, and there has been considerable controversy recently about proposed revisions in tenure for faculty. University administration wants to make it easier to lay off professors or reduce their pay if programs have been cut back or eliminated. We expect a fundamental restructuring of the American higher educational system within the context of the new economy's changing realities, and also because of altered perceptions of the value of academic symbols and credentials during a transformational period. Middle management has largely disappeared in some private sector organizations for reasons that are shared by many higher education institutions. We expect further elimination of those roles, as well as fundamental changes in the way scholarship and instructional services are provided in society, as the present system dissolves into something quite different. Eventually, many academic people are likely to be playing different kinds of roles in different kinds of organizations, with an overall net reduction in academic job opportunities. We reported recently on a growing number of students who qualify for Phi Beta Kappa who are declining the presumed honor, in some cases because they don't feel it's worth the $30-$50 fee. Much of existing academic structure depends on large numbers of persons believing that traditional symbols, such as the Ph.D. degree or the MBA degree, are somehow meaningful and worth major time investment and heavy debt loads.

One of his campaign promises last time was to "end welfare as we know it," and, in order to avoid ending his administration as we know it, he feels pressure to get it done in time for the election. He doesn't expect to be totally delighted with the House-Senate compromise bill that will reach his office, but he's in a tight spot. <b>Reuters</b> says he <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960728/news/stories/welfare_3.html">vows to veto</A> another "extremist bill," though. It's probably safe to say that no one, including the people in Congress who have moved the bills along, really has any idea what the real consequences of new legislation will be, so stand by for frantic efforts to try to fix things if it all begins to go wrong after passage. As anyone who has ever written a computer program knows, it isn't even easy to get two lines of code to do what you expect.

In the United States, another Clinton administration or a Dole administration will face the same problems and will have to deal with many of them in the same ways, despite all the talk now. The <b>Times</b> also has a new article in its Job Market section on "surviving the ax with outplacement."

The American unemployment rate hit the <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960705/business/stories/jobs_1.html">lowest level in six years</A> and the economy is generating jobs at a high rate. However, part of the dip in the unemployment rate in June is an artifact of the measurement being taken while many students were still in school, and a major portion of the new jobs are low-pay service jobs. The big news continues to be the structural changes in the American economy as well as in many other national economies worldwide. Feelings of economic insecurity run high, according to polls, despite strength on many conventional economic indicators. The Democrats are hoping that the President will be given credit for the economy's strengths in the November election. Republicans are hoping that this election year will be different, and that they will be able to tap into the remaining insecurities arising from the structural changes. So far, Clinton remains ahead in the polls, despite various scandals touching his administration, and the latest jobs data have helped <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960705/business/stories/dollar_1.html">strengthen the American currency</A>.

He urged business people to stop complaining about welfare, because the old system's gone, and <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1996-08/30/091L-083096-idx.html">start hiring people</A> who are coming off of it, according to <b>Reuters</b>.

Also in France today, <b>La Tribune Desfosses</b> reports that Prime Minister Alain Juppe has said the government has not met its targets for reducing unemployment and doesn't see much improvement in the jobs picture anytime soon. He says that the government will speed up negotiations with labor unions and employers on reducing the work week in order to address the high unemployment rate by "job sharing," an approach that has received more attention in Europe than in the United States. However, Europe has a much more serious unemployment problem at the moment. The U.S. economy is generating a lot of jobs, but the more fundamental structural changes are of greater concern. Many of the new jobs are relatively low pay.<br><br> <LI><strong>Want a job?</strong> (Thursday, 8/29/96) <br> More than 18,000 firefighters are battling dozens of blazes in the West, but <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960828/news/stories/wildfires_1.html">far more are needed</A>. Firefighters, that is. <br><br> <LI><strong>Longer shopping hours in Zurich getting resistance</strong> (Thursday, 8/29/96) <br> Swiss labor unions are resisting Zurich's plans to lengthen shopping hours because store employees wouldn't receive extra pay for the longer hours. Today's <b>Tages Anzeiger</b> reports. Several European countries are trying to keep stores open longer in order to stimulate their economies. There has been considerable labor conflict over the issue in Germany, which has had the most restrictive retail hours in Europe for about forty years.<br><br> <LI><strong>Austrian utility to cut between 400 and 500 jobs</strong> (Thursday, 8/29/96) <br> Verbundgesellschaft AG is Austria's largest utility and has indicated that it will continue to cut costs by cutting jobs. <b>Kurier</b> reports that the company intends to cut between 400 and 500 jobs of its 4,520 jobs by 1998. <br><br> <LI><strong>Meetings in Italy on public works plan </strong> (Thursday, 8/29/96) <br> Italian papers are reporting today that Italian government officials have been meeting with union and industry representatives over major investments in the Italian infrastructure that should result in a considerable number of jobs. The railroad and water distribution systems will be affected, and government offices throughout the country will be linked by a computer network.<br><br> <LI><strong>Spanish budget talks hit health care obstacle</strong> (Thursday, 8/29/96) <br> <b>La Expansion</b> reports that Spanish government officials and their Catalan parliamentary allies are disagreeing over health care cuts in the new budget. The government wants overall health care spending reduced and wants to tax prescription medications. The Catalans are in opposition.<br><br> <LI><strong>Australian government warns health funds</strong> (Thursday, 8/29/96) <br> Australian Prime Minister John Howard says that private health funds should be careful not to undermine the government's plan to offer tax rebates to those who take out private health insurance by increasing premiums, according to <b>The Australian</b>. The new conservative government has instituted an austerity plan which has included cuts in most public sectors. Our correspondent in Australia, Jock McCardell, reports that cuts in higher education have not been as great as expected. He says that it's widely believed that the government originally announced deeper cuts than were actually planned in order to make the actual cuts seem more acceptable to institutions affected.<br><br> <LI><strong>U.S. government restrictions affecting physicians eased</strong> (Thursday, 8/29/96) <br> There may be more bands of physicians now, but not necessarily making music. Stuart Auerbach of the <b>Washington Post</b> writes that the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice have <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1996-08/29/191L-082996-idx.html">reduced restrictions</A> on physicians organizing to counter managed care institutions.<br><br> <LI><strong>Minnesota gains population, jobs, income</strong> (Thursday, 8/29/96) <br> Today's <b>Minneapolis Star Tribune</b> reports that <A HREF="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/article/slugEval.cgi?currentSlug=pop29">Minnesota has done well</A> during the first half of the 1990s. <br><br> <LI><strong>Human exploitation huge part of the new economy</strong> (Wednesday, 8/28/96) <br> The international conference on the sexual exploitation of children is underway in Stockholm, and Carol Bellamy, Executive director of UNICEF, reports that the commercial sexual exploitation of children now extends worldwide and is a <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960827/international/stories/children_2.html">multi-billion dollar industry</A>. There has also been a tremendous increase in the international trafficking of women, as sexual slavery increases throughout much of the world as well. These phenomena have existed throughout history, and we probably won't get very far trying to explain why something exists at all. However, we do need to explain the "variance." That is, how can we account for increases or decreases over time or variability across different regions? Among other things, there are growing signs that human life is regarded by an increasing number of people as having little value, a condition that may be exacerbated by the population explosion combined with the growing gap between rich and poor, not only within nations, but also across nations and regions. <br><br> <LI><strong>Political impact of recent hunger strike continues to spread</strong> (Wednesday, 8/28/96) <br> There is continuing evidence of conflict within the French Cabinet over the recent hunger strike and occupation of a Paris church by illegal African immigrants. In addition, fallout from the occupation and subsequent police action is now influencing relations between France and other countries. <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960827/international/stories/france_1.html">Here's the Reuters story</A> this morning. <br><br> <LI><strong>Caterpillar threatens unilateral action</strong> (Wednesday, 8/28/96) <br> Caterpillar says it is at impasse with the United Auto Workers and will <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960828/business/stories/caterpillar_1.html">impose employment terms</A> beginning October 1. The strike at Caterpillar has continued for 17 months. <br><br> <LI><strong>New interactive CD-ROMs for girls</strong> (Wednesday, 8/28/96) <br> Many girls resist becoming involved with computers, just as many women avoid mathematics or technical school subjects, despite evidence that men are not inherently better suited for these pursuits. In the new economy, persons who resist learning computer skills or who rule out technical subjects will be at a fundamental disadvantage and perhaps more likely to end up in dead-end careers. <b>Business Wire</b> reports that Simon & Schuster Interactive is releasing Let's Talk About ME!, one of the first CD-ROM's created exclusively for preteen and teen girls, developed in conjunction with Girl Games Inc., pioneers of interactive software for the female audience. The programs are based on extensive research, as well as on interviews with a number of successful women, and are intended to help girls explore their relationships, self-image, personality and potential, while also becoming more comfortable with computers. <br><br> <LI><strong>Slightly more women serving on boards</strong> (Wednesday, 8/28/96) <br> <b>PRNewswire</b> reports on a national survey conducted by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. showing that 10 percent of board members are now women, an increase of two or three percent over recent years. The survey found that 94 percent of board members in the companies polled are Caucasian, four percent African-American, and Hispanic and Asian, one percent each.<br><br> <LI><strong>Another miner killed</strong> (Wednesday, 8/28/96) <br> Another miner has been killed at a gold mine southwest of Johannesburg, according to a <b>Reuters</b> report. South Africa's mining industry has been plagued with violence.<br><br> <LI><strong>More on American middle-class nervousness</strong> (Wednesday, 8/28/96) <br> The September/October edition of <b>The Humanist</b> contains an article by Charles Whalen called "The Anxious Society: Middle Class Insecurity and the Crisis of the American Dream." In the same edition, Ernest Stableford writes on downsizing and "newspeak," in which companies talk about "empowerment," but practice the opposite. <br><br> <LI><strong>Student uprising</strong> (Wednesday, 8/28/96) <br> Check the August edition of <b>Inc.</b> magazine for a story telling about how students are starting their own businesses in record numbers. A major reason: poor job prospects.<br><br> <LI><strong>20th anniversary celebrated</strong> (Wednesday, 8/28/96) <br> <b>Working Woman</b> magazine is 20 years old. See the September edition, which, among many other things, contains an article by leading financial expert Jane Bryant Quinn on the occasion of the magazine's 20th anniversary.<br><br> <LI><strong>Democrats meet for second day, inefficiently</strong> (Tuesday, 8/27/96) <br> The Republican National Convention went off like a well-oiled machine, but the Democrats, true to their reputation of greater indiscipline, are <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960827/news/stories/democrats_2.html">mixing it up</A> a bit more chaotically, bringing to mind Will Rogers' remark of not belonging to any organized political party, meaning that he was a Democrat. Trying to guard against over-confidence, some are nonetheless talking openly of a "three-run homer" that would not only re-elect President Clinton, but also restore Democratic control of <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960827/news/stories/campaign_36.html">both houses of Congress</A> only two years after the historic Republican sweep. A week can be an eternity in politics, so stay tuned. Like Dole and Kemp, Clinton will have to exercise genuine leadership and resist the urges of many delegates in order to appeal to the mood of the country and maximize the likelihood of a win. Economic issues are likely to remain central in the campaign. Evidence of this is President Clinton's announcement of a major <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960826/politics/stories/welfare_7.html">jobs program</A> to help people coming off welfare.<br><br> <LI><strong>Conference on sexual exploitation of children begins in Stockholm</strong> (Tuesday, 8/27/96) <br> <b>Reuters</b> reports on the opening of the international conference at a time when a <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960827/international/stories/children_1.html">scandal unfolds</A> in Belgium. <br><br> <LI><strong>Court prevents expulsion of some former hunger strikers</strong> (Tuesday, 8/27/96) <br> A French court has <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960826/international/stories/france_7.html">barred expulsion</A> of three of the ten immigrants. The case has divided the French government and continues to produce political reverberations.<br><br> <LI><strong>More on American automotive industry negotiations</strong> (Tuesday, 8/27/96) <br> <b>Reuters</b> reports on the <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960827/business/stories/uaw_5.html">New York Times story</A>. <br><br> <LI><strong>Reich may return to Harvard</strong> (Tuesday, 8/27/96) <br> The September 2 edition of <b>Business Week</b> speculates on the composition of Clinton's cabinet during a second administration. U. S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich is expected to return to Harvard, but several other economic advisers may stay in the administration, although there may be some shuffling of chairs. Of course, Clinton has to win the election first. <br><br> <LI><strong>How some companies are managing diversity</strong> (Tuesday, 8/27/96) <br> The September 9 edition of <b>Fortune</b> magazine contains a story on why some companies' diversity training programs have been useless and even abusive, and how some companies are getting smarter about diversity. Also, check the same edition for a review of John Kao's <b>Jamming: the Road to Creativity</b>. A free-flowing, creative workplace can emulate late-night jazz sessions, he says. Wait a minute. This isn't a new idea. Alvin Toffler, in his 1990 book, <b>Power Shift</b>, talks about the "jazz combo" form of work organization.<br><br> <LI><strong>Making it in the 21st century</strong> (Tuesday, 8/27/96) <br> Check the July/August edition of <b>The Futurist</b> for an article describing what students must know to succeed in the next century, with the emphasis on "must." <br><br> <LI><strong>Democratic convention opens in Chicago</strong> (Monday, 8/26/96) <br> The polls are showing a widening Clinton lead again, after a period when the gap between the two candidates closed following the Republican National Convention in San Diego. Now, <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960826/news/stories/campaign_34.html">it's the Democrats' turn</A>, and, as usual, we can expect their convention to provide a boost similar to the one the Republicans received. The Democrats will emphasize the strength of the economy according to conventional indicators, while the Republicans will try to tap middle-class anxieties arising from the more fundamental structural changes that are occurring. For the time being, we can expect Dole to continue emphasizing his proposed across-the-board tax cut, unless or until the polls clearly show that people don't believe it or don't think it will work. Interestingly, in addition to being relatively close ideologically, something that both will try to obscure during the campaign, Clinton and Dole face a similar problem at their conventions. On average, the Republican delegates were more "conservative" than Dole, and the Democratic delegates are more "liberal" than Clinton. Every news service in the United States will be filled with convention stories, but we're linking to one from <b>Reuters</b> this morning. Incidentally, surely of interest to campaign strategists in both camps, a new Manpower, Inc. survey indicates that job prospects <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960826/business/stories/jobs_2.html">will get even better</A> during the 4th quarter.<br><br> <LI><strong>UAW and auto companies talk about lengthening the cycle</strong> (Monday, 8/26/96) <br> <b>Bloomberg</b>, the <b>Wall Street Journal</b>, and <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960826/business/stories/autos_3.html">Reuters</A> are reporting today that the American automobile industry's "big three" and the United Auto Workers union are discussing the possibility of longer contracts which could double the time between negotiations. <br><br> <LI><strong>Political impact of recent hunger strike continues in France</strong> (Monday, 8/26/96) <br> Today's <b>Christian Science Monitor</b> reports on the <A HREF="http://www.csmonitor.com/todays_paper/graphical/today/intl/intl.3.html">growing political storm</A> in France.

The jury had awarded a former employee nearly $5 million in damages. <br><br> <LI><strong>Chances for agreement in retail wage talks improving</strong> (Monday, 8/26/96) <br> <b>Sueddeutsche Zeitung</b> reports that union leaders see the possibility of a breakthrough in talks affecting retail workers in North Rhine-Westphalia. For the first time since the 1950's, retail trade hours will be extended in Germany in November. At issue is whether workers will receive extra pay for working during the extended hours.<br><br> <LI><strong>Philippine government fines securities firm</strong> (Monday, 8/26/96) <br> Philippine papers are reporting that the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission has fined I.B.

The program consists of an introductory workshop, and, for those who qualify, a seven-session course. Successful graduates may be able to receive financing from a consortium of private and public organizations. For more information, contact Rose M. Smith at (609) 292-0359. <br><br> <LI><strong>Coalition offers kit for business leaders</strong> (Monday, 8/26/96) <br> The Business Coalition for Education Reform, a collaboration of 12 national business organizations, intends to support and expand business involvement in education at the national, state and local levels. Persons interested in helping to support academic standards in their communities can order the Coalition's Standards Mean Business Leadership Kit by calling (800) 787-2848. The kit costs $50.00 plus postage and handling. <br><br> <LI><strong>More sale of financial products in work settings</strong> (Monday, 8/26/96) <br> The June 1996 edition of <b>Best's Review</b> reports that the workplace is becoming an increasingly favored setting for the sale of insurance and other financial products. Employers are interested in making benefits available to employees while controlling costs, while many workers seem to like purchasing financial products at work. <br><br> <LI><strong>Large union presence expected in Chicago</strong> (Sunday, 8/25/96) <br> President Clinton has been looking too much like a Republican to some union members, so they want to do what they can to keep their party from leaving them. <b>Reuters</b> reports that unions will be <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960824/politics/stories/labor_2.html">out in force</A> in Chicago next week. <br><br> <LI><strong>New debate on measuring worth in corporations</strong> (Sunday, 8/25/96) <br> Mark Landler, writing in today's <b>New York Times</b>, tells about the broader implications of Alex Mandl's $20 million signing bonus.

The Republican National Convention closed in San Diego last night with speeches by the presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Dole mentioned the word "abortion" only once in his speech, and seemed to try to move on quickly. The Pat Buchanan group and others would like the abortion issue to become a central feature of the campaign, but Dole and Kemp have been equally committed to de-emphasizing it, and they're in charge now. Both are widely perceived by supporters and opponents alike as traditionally family-oriented "good guys," so they should be able to promote "family values" without sounding hypocritical, while leaving plenty of time to emphasize economic growth issues and jobs. If this were the old economy, they might largely abandon those issues to the Democrats, because, ordinarily, a relatively strong economy favors the incumbent in a presidential campaign. However, Republican strategists are well-aware that the more fundamental structural changes that are going on are causing deep anxieties on the part of many Americans, and they will attempt to tap into those. It will be a new campaign for a new economy. Polls show that Clinton's <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960815/politics/stories/polls_5.html">lead has been cut</A> following the Republican convention and the candidates' speeches, but the Democratic convention is coming up, and the Democrats can expect at least a temporary "bump" in their ratings from that too. National conventions typically stimulate awareness among many persons who haven't been thinking much about the election previously. The real story will come during the weeks following both conventions as the campaign heats up and the airwaves become saturated with ads and news stories. Both sides expect the Clinton lead to tighten, but, at this point, the election's probably still Clinton's to lose. However, even though the President hasn't been implicated in anything, the Republicans want to be in position in case a legal or public relations "time bomb" in relation to the Whitewater affair blows sky high about Nobember 1.<br><br> <LI><strong>Zelnick book blasts affirmative action</strong> (Friday, 8/16/96) <br> ABC News correspondent Bob Zelnick appeared on Public Television's TechnoPolitics last night to discuss his new book, <b>Back Fire: A Reporter Looks at Affirmative Action</b>.

Remarkably, in most cases, this heterogeneity coalesces around a single candidate in American presidential campaigns in a way that eventually offers voters a simple choice by election day. Of course, appearances are almost never the same as underlying realities, and the factors determining political perceptions and attitudes are particularly interesting, as are the deliberate efforts to manipulate them. In order to clarify things for voters, at least for the moment, Jack Kemp has <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960815/news/stories/kemp_5.html">changed his positions</A> on affirmative action and immigration in order to bring them in line with those of Robert Dole, who formally won the Republican presidential nomination last night in San Diego.

Republican Bob Dole's choice for Vice President, Jack Kemp, is a former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development with a reputation as a "supply sider" in economics as well as a leader open to experiment in dealing with the conditions of America's poor. He calls himself a "bleeding-heart conservative," and, while generally regarded as more "conservative" than Bob Dole, with whom he has been at odds at various times for years, he seems more "liberal" on some issues. Also, at a California rally last night, former Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan also <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960812/news/stories/buchanan_2.html">emphasized economic issues</A> and the flight of jobs, as did Reform Party founder Ross Perot <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960812/news/stories/reform_3.html">at that party's convention</A> in Long Beach. Buchanan has called a "temporary truce" with the Republican Party, he says, encouraging his followers, at least for the moment, to remain Republican and, apparently, to support the presumed Republican nominee, Robert Dole. Traditional labels are getting confused, though. Reform Party candidate Richard Lamm is a former Democrat, while his running mate is a former Republican. Moreover, Ross Perot has recently co-authored a book with retiring Democratic U. S. Senator Paul Simon. Got all that? Incidentally, Paul Simon doesn't really look like he sounds on his records. Tee-hee.<br><br> <LI><strong>Affirmative action to be debated on Firing Line</strong> (Monday, 8/12/96) <br> PBS has long been accused of a liberal bias by American conservatives, but William Buckley's Firing Squad, er, Firing Line is one of the longest running programs on American public television. Buckley has been an influential conservative intellectual leader for more than forty years, helping to forge the conservative orientation of the Republican Party during recent years. Unlike more recent media figures, such as the wildly popular but far less sophisticated Rush Limbaugh, Buckley does not deliberately caricature opposing points of view or engage in the sort of selectivity that scientists know they cannot tolerate if they want to be able to trust their conclusions. Someone once said on television that Buckley was not the brightest person at Yale University at the time he was a student there, which may be hard to believe. Nonetheless, among the things he may like even more than conservative political ideology are smart repartee and vigorous debate in which opposing points of view are presented in their strongest forms. Now and then, he uses his television program to present some of the best debate in the media, and he doesn't hesitate to invite the smartest, best informed, and most articulate representatives on all sides of important issues. Moreover, he is known to have cordial personal relationships with many leaders with whom he disagrees ideologically and with whom he likes to argue. Tonight, check your local listings for a special two-hour Firing Line dealing with the affirmative action issue.

First, the welfare bill is sent to the President, who says he will sign it. Senator Moynihan objects vigorously, saying that it could result in a third of a million children on the streets. If education benefits are denied to children of illegal immigrants, this should also contribute to the number of impoverished street children in the United States, a condition common in third-world countries. This issue is <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1996-08/03/048L-080396-idx.html">holding up the immigration bill</A>, reports the <b>Washington Post</b>. However, the Congress has passed the minimum wage bill, as <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960803/news/stories/wage_3.html">Reuters</A> reports.

Meanwhile, Russian President Yeltsin is said to be so exhausted that he needs two months to recover amid growing concerns about his health. <br><br> <LI><strong>Clinton set to sign</strong> (Friday, 8/2/96) <br> President Clinton will sign the new welfare bill, as all American news organizations are reporting, now that it's passed the Senate. Incidentally, here's <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/APONLINE/WASHDC/slugs5327.htm">how the Senators voted</A>. Today's <b>New York Times</b> contains a <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/library/politics/0802clinton-welfare.html">major analysis</A> of how Clinton's position on welfare reflects the "new Democrat." The <b>Christian Science Monitor</b> examines the <A HREF="http://www.csmonitor.com/todays_paper/graphical/today/us/us.3.html">impact of the historic legislation</A> on the states. Today's <b>Washington Post</b> looks at <A HREF="http://wp2.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1996-08/02/008R-080296-idx.html">California's situation</A>, and the <b>New York Times</b> reports that a <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/front/welfare-newyork.html">special legislative session</A> may be in the works for New York to deal with implications. <br><br> <LI><strong>Unemployment rate slightly higher</strong> (Friday, 8/2/96) <br> <b>Reuters</b> reports that the U.S. unemployment rate <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960802/news/stories/economy_6.html">increased slightly</A> in July, but the number of new unemployment benefit claims fell to a <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/business/stories/jobless_1.html">seven-year low</A> last week. Overall, the <A HREF="http://www.csmonitor.com/todays_paper/graphical/today/econ/econ.1.html">American economy is cooking</A>, and President Clinton's campaign should be helped by the latest figures, according to the <b>Christian Science Monitor</b>.<br><br> <LI><strong>Health care and minimum wage bills soon to become law as well</strong> (Friday, 8/2/96) <br> Here's the <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/digest/nat2.htm">Washington Post</A> story and here's the story from <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960802/news/stories/health_9.html">Reuters</A>, which also reports today on <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960802/international/stories/indonesia_4.html">accusations of subversion</A> in Indonesia, and a new <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960802/business/stories/aetna_1.html">pension company</A> in the United States.<br><br> <LI><strong>Pilots to be recalled</strong> (Friday, 8/2/96) <br> American Airlines laid off 610 pilots in 1993 and 1994, but the <b>Wall Street Journal</b> reports that they're all getting their jobs back, now that the remaining 376 are being recalled. Crew shortages were resulting in flight cancellations in late July.<br><br> <LI><strong>Fall in Belgium unemployment</strong> (Friday, 8/2/96) <br> <b>L'Echo</b> reports that total joblessness in Belgium fell 5.2 percent compared to a year ago.

It has also demoted its president because he was prepared to expand the company's business into horse racing. <br><br> <LI><strong>Time to plan retirement is NOW</strong> (Friday, 8/2/96) <br> Here's a <b>Washington Post</b> article on <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/mym/columns/retire/whenplan.htm">retirement planning</A>, which is part of a <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/mym/columns/stylist.htm#Retire">larger collection</A>.

It will be the biggest change in the American social safety net in 60 years. Clinton's decision to sign the bill is <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/news/stories/welfarepolitics_1.html">angering some Democrats</A>. The division among Democrats was reflected in the House vote. By signing the basically Republican bill, Clinton has taken welfare as a presidential campaign issue away from the Republicans, although Candidate Dole is <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/politics/stories/dolewelfare_1.html">claiming credit</A> for it. Robert Reno, writing in <b>Newsday</b>, talks about reform for a "new dark age" and remarks on our <A HREF="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/article/slugEval.cgi?currentSlug=reno01">short memories</A>. The ability of the politicians to accurately forecast the behavioral effects of this huge social engineering project depends on the accuracy of their assumptions about human nature, and what they know depends entirely on how they know it. Reports cited here are from the <b>Washington Post</b>, the <b>Minneapolis Star Tribune</b>, and <b>Reuters</b>. <br><br> <LI><strong>New welfare laws in effect in Germany</strong> (Thursday, 8/1/96) <br> <b>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</b> reports that stricter welfare laws take effect today requiring people to accept a wider range of jobs, not just ones specifically tailored to their skills. Otherwise, they will lose 25% of their assistance. <br><br> <LI><strong>American GDP up strongly</strong> (Thursday, 8/1/96) <br> <b>Reuters</b> reports that the American Gross Domestic Product rose at the <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/news/stories/economy_4.html">fastest rate in two years</A> during the second quarter. <br><br> <LI><strong>Agreement on health and minimum wage seems imminent</strong> (Thursday, 8/1/96) <br> <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/news/stories/health_6.html">Reuters</A> and the <A HREF="http://wp2.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1996-08/01/116L-080196-idx.html">Washington Post</A> report on the flurry of activity in Washington that seems to mean new legislation is on the horizon in additional long-contested areas. However, Democrats worry about the <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/politics/stories/wages_1.html">tax cuts</A> included in the minimum wage bill, some calling them <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/business/stories/wage_1.html">"loopholes"</A>. Clay Chandler of the <b>Washington Post</b> says the cuts may <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPlate/1996-08/01/161L-080196-idx.html">help some small businesses</A> but may raise the price of an airline ticket. Incidentally, with respect to the health care issue, today's <b>Wall Street Journal</b> reports that health care costs increased by the smallest amount on record, according to the latest Department of Labor figures. The market seems to be fixing some of the problems that led to heavy discussion of massive health care reform two years ago. The problem of access is still major, however, and the new health care bill will fix only a small part of that. <br><br> <LI><strong>Downsizing at the IRS</strong> (Thursday, 8/1/96) <br> The Internal Revenue Service, the American agency that collects federal taxes, will <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/news/stories/irs_1.html">eliminate 5,000 jobs</A>. Speaking of taxes, Russia says it will <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960731/international/stories/russia_1.html">crack down on collections</A> in order to ease the "gridlock" problem in the Russian economy. Large numbers of workers have not been paid by the government for months because of inadequate revenues. Among other things, this has led to a major coal minters strike that is further paralyzing the Russian economy.<br><br> <LI><strong>Job cuts at U.S. West</strong> (Thursday, 8/1/96) <br> U S West Communications has already announced 9,000 jobs overall. Now, it's saying that <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/business/stories/uswest_1.html">5,000 of those</A> will occur by the end of 1997, 1,500 by the <A HREF="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/article/slugEval.cgi?currentSlug=jobs01">end of this year</A>. <br><br> <LI><strong>More on the McDonnell Douglas benefit issue</strong> (Thursday, 8/1/96) <br> Here's <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/960801/business/stories/mcdonnell_1.html">another story</A> from <b>Reuters</b> on striking McDonnell Douglas workers' eligibility for unemployment benefits, according to a Missouri state government ruling. <b>Reuters</b> also reports today on a man's winning a $250,000 <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/HOME/NEWS/APONLINE/NATIONAL/slugs5537.htm">sexual harassment suit</A>. <br><br> <LI><strong>Italian postal service resumes hiring</strong> (Thursday, 8/1/96) <br> <b>La Repubblica</b> reports that more employees of the Italian postal service than expected have accepted early retirement, so the service will resume hiring.

Readers may wonder why, in sifting through international work-related press reports each day, there is so little news from that quarter of the world's population that lives in China. The reason is that to say that China lacks a free press may be one of the stronger understatements of the century. Moreover, the Chinese government does its best to control the operation of the rest of the world's press inside the country as well, and they're pretty good at it. Their efforts to control the flow of information both into and out of the country sometimes appear almost frantic, but perhaps with good reason. Social organization at all levels is determined in large part by who is able to talk to whom about what under what conditions and when.

The university's Board of Regents has drafted provisions over objections from both the university's president and its faculty that could effectively eliminate tenure as traditionally understood. Critics have long opposed tenure as guaranteeing "employment for life" to professors, whatever the need for their services or the quality of their performance. Proponents have long insisted that the politically sensitive nature of free inquiry and free expression, defining elements of a university, require that professors be protected from retaliation over the expression of unpopular ideas. The Board's draft includes a provision that could allow for dismissal for "uncooperative attitude." Some feel that this case could be the beginning of the end of academic tenure, as the higher education institution begins a fundamental restructuring for the new millennium. Given all the other changes that are going on at the same time, it could also mark the beginning of the end of many conventional higher educational institutions, as non-traditional mechanisms for the delivery of instructional services develop quickly. One of the fundamental trends across the new economy is a more direct relationship between individuals and markets. There is little reason why professors could not directly provide some instructional service without the mediation of conventional bureaucratic structure, for instance, which, as in other industries, may become increasingly irrelevant and counterproductive.

In recent years, the "detector" has been turned up to a point where it may be generating false positives by responding to background static. Now, the trend may be reversing a bit. The still unresolved problem is how to protect victims and potential victims without creating other kinds of victims. <br><br><LI><strong>Preparing journalists for the new journalism</strong> (Sunday, 11/10/96)<br>What do the new media mean for journalists and journalism education?

Mary McCormick writes in the <b>Minneapolis Star Tribune</b> about <A HREF="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/article/slugEval.cgi?currentSlug=FORU04">how to do it successfully</A>. For one thing, an increasing number of people will have to learn how to relate across cultures in a new global economy. Also, health care organizations are <A HREF="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/article/slugEval.cgi?currentSlug=PROF04">among the largest nonprofits</A> in a new listing, and columnist Anthony Lewis writes about GOP use of <A HREF="http://www.startribune.com/cgi-bin/article/slugEval.cgi?currentSlug=lew04">"immigration scare tactics"</A>. Lewis is syndicated nationally. Incidentally, for historical reasons that aren't particularly interesting, "GOP" is another name for the American Republican Party. For the benefit of our readers outside North America, perhaps we should say that America's two major political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, have historical roots going back a long time, and both claim ties to Thomas Jefferson during the early years of the country. While Democrats have attracted most of the minority vote for many years, most of the Southern segregationists were Democrats, and it was a Republican president who led the North to victory in the American Civil War and ended slavery. For several decades, American Democrats have been in some ways similar to the democratic socialist parties of Europe, while recent Republicans are ideologically similar to Britain's Conservatives. However, it's easy to exaggerate the similarities, given the influence of local conditions, and both major American parties have been undergoing changes recently. <br><br><LI><strong>Parents frustrated by Illinois school strike</strong> (Monday, 11/4/96)<br>The Niles Township school strike goes on. <A HREF="http://www.suntimes.com/news/newsitems/NILES_Nov04.html">Here's the latest</A> from the <b>Chicago Sun-Times</b>. <br><br><LI><strong>Hong Kong professor says government reluctant to recognize poverty</strong> (Monday, 11/4/96)<br><A HREF="http://www.hkstandard.com/online/news/001/hongkong/news010.htm">Recognizing that poverty exists</A> in Hong Kong would have budgetary implications, according to Professor Stewart MacPherson.

In response, union organizers stepped up their campaign, and this hasn't been settled yet, although tenure doesn't appear to be so much threatened as a few weeks ago. Now, the university has begun the process of recruiting a new president, and two of the candidates have withdrawn. Minnesota's governor says they should stop the process. It appears to be one of those "You do it, no you do it, no you do it" kinds of competitions. Look for more stress and strife on campuses all over North America, as the work world revolution begins to shake academe to its foundations at roughly the same time that the modern university institution begins its second thousand years.

He has had extensive experience as a research scientist, engineer, entrepreneur, executive, consultant, and educator. <p>Jerry spent more than twenty years on the cutting edge of high-technology research and development. He has played key technical and management roles in the development of new processes, products, and companies, as well as innovative consortial programs and strategic alliances across business, academe, and government. He has had extensive team building, entrepreneurial, strategic planning, and business planning experience. He has also worked to assist others in the development of their full creative potential for success in a radically reorganized economic context. For example, in addition to everything else, Jerry is a Licensed Career Counselor in the State of Texas.<p>In addition to post-graduate training in business and management, Jerry holds B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota. During the mid-1970's, he did post-doctoral work at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in West Germany, and, then, served on the faculty of the Free University of Berlin, where the great physicist, Werner Heisenberg, had worked years earlier. He has also taught and helped in the development of electrical engineering curricula in the Minnesota State University system.<p>Jerry worked as a Senior Principal Research Scientist at the Honeywell Systems and Research Center in Minneapolis for several years, where he acted as manager of several projects involving laser radar, laser remote sensing and commercialization of gas laser technologies.<p>Jerry served as Senior Principal Design Engineer for Rosemount, Inc. in Minneapolis, where he was responsible for strategic planning, technology assessment, technical evaluation of acquisition and licensing candidates and monitoring of contract research in fiberoptic sensors and laser remote sensing. Following this, he served as Senior Consultant at Control Data Corporation, where he was responsible for strategic planning in optoelectronics and fiber optic interconnects and also organized and conducted various seminars and professional conferences. <p>In 1989, Jerry went to work as Program Manager of the Optics in Computing Program, at Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC) in Austin, Texas, a research and technology consortium organized by Bobby Inman. He formed and managed a large program for commercialization of holographic data storage, involving the U.S. Department of Commerce's Advanced Technology Program, MCC, and several large corporations. He also served as Director of High End Products for Tamarack Storage Devices, a spin-off company formed to develop and manufacture holographic storage products. <p>During the 1980's, Jerry was founder and CEO of Minnesota Laser Corporation. More recently, he founded <a name= "careers"</a><A HREF="http://www.colinc.com/">Careers Online, Inc.</A>, an innovative recruitment firm specializing in personnel with expertise in leading-edge computer software technologies and applications, worldwide.<p>During recent years, Jerry has become increasingly concerned with broader issues relating to life and work in the revolutionary new world economy, including the implications of historic changes for individual well-being, family relationships, and education. For instance, rather than focusing on technology itself from now on, Jerry will concern himself with the personal and social <em>implications</em> of technology. Like his equal partner, Gary Johnson, Jerry has had extensive international experience and tries to maintain a global perspective on work, education, and most other things.<p>Dr. Jerry Willenbring is Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of The New Work Corporation. In addition to his executive responsibilities in guiding our company, Jerry will make media appearances, spend considerable time writing, and conduct seminars on life and work in the revolutionary new world economy for individuals, business, and education.<p>Now, go to an introduction to Jerry's equal partner, <A HREF="Gary.html">Gary Johnson</A><p><p><p><p><p><center><hr width=200; size=5><FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="default.html"><b>Return to top of home page</strong></A><p><FONT SIZE=+1><strong><A HREF="Today's_news.html">NewWork News</A> | <A HREF="Guest_commentary.html">Guest Commentary</A> | <A HREF="NewWork_reviews.html">Reviews</A> |<A HREF="Tech_watch.html">Tech Watch</A><br><A HREF="Ed_watch.html">Ed Watch</A> |<A HREF="Resources.html">Resources</A> | <A HREF ="Archives.html">Archives</A> | <A HREF ="Feedback.html">Feedback</A></FONT></strong></center><center><hr width=200; size=5></center><p><p><center><img src="LogoB.GIF" alt="[BraveNewWorkWorld and NewWork News are at http://www.newwork.com.

To our east is the beautiful state of Wisconsin, to our south the vital agricultural state of Iowa, and to our west, the states of North and South Dakota, where America's west begins. <BR> <BR>I've lived many places both here and abroad during the past thirty-five years; but, while I was born in California, I grew up in neighboring North Dakota, only a few miles from the exact geographical center of the North American continent. I've lived and worked more than twenty years in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area now. My wife Roberta and I chose this region during the mid-1970's, after returning from several years in Asia and Europe. <BR> <BR>Minnesota is a truly lovely part of the world, if one does not mind extremes in weather. It contains the beautiful Twin Cities region, as well as rolling farm land in the south and west, and pristine wilderness in the north. We are called the "land of 10,000 lakes," but the total is really nearer 14,000. Remarkably, some of the best fresh water fishing in the United States can be found within the boundaries of one of the world's great cities, the metropolitan Minneapolis-Saint Paul area! <BR> <BR>Minnesota also has an international seaport, of all things, out here in the middle of the vast North American continent. Duluth is a beautiful city on the banks of scenic Lake Superior, a major inland freshwater sea, and Duluth harbor accepts ships from throughout the world via the St. Lawrence Seaway. Many visitors to our Twin Cities don't realize that they are only 140 miles from a totally different experience, and they should not miss it. <BR> <BR>Life in Minnesota isn't entirely easy, however. The village of Tower, about 235 miles from where I write this, recorded 60 degrees below zero a few weeks ago. That's actual air temperature, not "funny wind chill degrees." which take wind velocities into account when calculating how quickly skin freezes. However, a week later, it was 50 degrees above zero in Tower. A one-hundred-ten degree difference within only a week! I should hasten to emphasize that this was an all-time record, not a typical thing, even in Minnesota. <BR> <BR><H2>Changes at BraveNewWorkWorld</H2>If you've been with us from the beginning, you know that there have been some changes at our site. We have been reorganizing, and the process is not yet complete. The serious illness of one of our colleagues during the fall has been followed by a variety of events requiring the full attention of my colleague, <A HREF="Jerry.html">Dr. Jerry Willenbring</A>. <BR> <BR> Jerry is my principal partner in The New Work Corporation, but he is also founder of <A HREF ="http://www.colinc.com">Careers Online, Inc.</A>, an innovative and increasingly influential placement and consulting firm brokering high-technology expertise worldwide. The company needs Jerry's full attention for the moment, in order to maintain its momentum, grow, and play its proper role in the recovering California economy, as well as in the international hi-tech universe in which Jerry has played key roles for so many years. <BR> <BR>Gary Johnson Communications has acquired full rights to the BraveNewWorkWorld and NewWork trademarks, as well as all BraveNewWorkWorld copyrights previously held by The New Work Corporation. We will continue to develop the BraveNewWorkWorld web site, as well as various other programs and productions in conventional print and broadcast, as well as hi-tech media. <BR> <BR>The New Work Corporation has been put on a slower track, but will be involved in the development of multimedia training, educational, professional, and self-help programs over the next several years. <BR> <BR><H2>Callies joins BraveNewWorkWorld</H2>We're delighted to announce that Teresa Callies, a long-time member of the Minnesota Public Radio news organization, has joined us at BraveNewWorkWorld. Teresa has a global perspective based, not only on her academic background, but also on her extensive international experience. In addition to a special interest in the worldwide work revolution, she has a background in international relations, with special expertise in Greek life and politics. You may have read her recent opinion piece in the <b>Minneapolis Star Tribune</b>. <BR> <BR>Our <b>NewWork News</b> page is still only a pale shadow of what we intend for it to become during 1996. We intend that NewWork News will not only gather and organize work-related news from the vast amounts of information available from the world's press, including the academic press, but also put it in context. Teresa Callies' contributions to the full development of NewWork News will be invaluable. We believe that there's nothing else quite like <b>BraveNewWorkWorld</b>, and, also with Teresa's help, we will develop the site as a whole over the months ahead. <BR> <BR>We're pleased that Mr. Jock McCardell of the University of New England in Australia has consented to write our first <b>Guest Commentary</b>. We expect that our Guest Commentary page will become the worldwide forum on the revolutionary new world of work. Many more commentaries will follow, written by a variety of thoughtful persons from a variety of perspectives. Nominations for guest commentary authors are welcomed, because we want dozens of quality contributions, then tens of dozens. <BR> <BR><H2>Some thoughts on the media revolution in the <BR>current political climate</H2>For many years, I genuinely loved broadcasting. Beginning very early, I dreamed of being on the radio, then television. This dream was stimulated by listening to the great stars during radio's "golden age," such as Jack Benny, "the great Gildersleeve," Fibber McGee and Molly, and others. My mother tells about how I used to do lengthy "radio programs" of my own in our barn in North Dakota when I was about seven years old. I had fashioned a microphone out of a "farmer's" match box connected to a wooden yardstick. <BR> <BR>When I was a child, I thought Jim Rohn was the greatest radio announcer in the world. To me, he was as big a star as anybody on the networks, even though I first heard him on KSJB, a regional station in the Dakotas where I eventually started my own career. Later, Jim was "Captain Jim" on Ch. 4, a children's program, as well as "Oompa Jim" on a Polka show, and also the weather man each night on the news strip. He was a wonderful broadcaster. Thanks, Jim. <BR> <BR>My obsession was stimulated further by a tour of CBS Television City, just across the fence from Farmer's Market, in "Hollywood" sometime during the mid-'50's. Ours was a very leisurely tour during a more leisurely time. We walked in on a rehearsal of the Jack Benny show, and I recognized Mel Blanc, the voice of Bugs Bunny, among other things, sitting in the front row of the bleachers. I was allowed to wander leisurely and at will over the set of "Art Linkletter's House Party," examining in detail the pieces that were so familiar on our TV screen on the farm in North Dakota. Art was one of classic network radio and television's biggest, most durable, and most beloved stars, as well as one of Hollywood's most successful entrepreneurs during the '40s and '50's. <BR> <BR>Down the hall, we visited a huge studio where both "Playhouse 90" and "Climax" were presented live on CBS-TV each week. A tremendous number of set pieces were mixed together with tags taped to them indicating which of the two shows and in which scenes the pieces would be used that week. The pieces had been built or modified right in the studio. Work benches and carpentry equipment lined the walls. <BR> <BR>I could not believe it. Two different dramatic shows broadcast live on the network <CITE>adjacent</CITE> to each other! Two and one-half hours of continuous live television with different casts and overlapping crews and all from the same studio! I could only imagine what things must have been like in that studio while they were on the air. We now know that some of the very best work that television has ever done happened in that room during those years. Many of the writers, directors, and actors from "Playhouse 90," in particular, became legendary. It made me appreciate, with awe, the great gifts of people in the media's big time. <BR> <BR>I was reminded again recently when, after working for a couple of hours to produce some very simple things for a radio station, I saw the wonderful new film, "Sense and Sensibility." Nearly everything about this film is nearly perfect, including the original author's work nearly two centuries ago. Cambridge University-educated star and screenwriter, Emma Thompson, clearly is a genius; but I think she would have been as remarkable, had she not attended university at all. Her talent is that large. Having just struggled a bit to produce simple things, I was alert to what it must take to put really extraordinary images on the big screen. Similarly, everyone should take piano lessons for a while, if only to appreciate what Horowitz could do. <BR> <BR>Anyway, years later, when NBC's "The Tonight Show" was still produced in New York, I found myself standing in the doorway of a very tiny control room at Rockefeller Center one late afternoon, chatting with three technicians who kept their eyes on a lot of meters and dials in front of them. Johnny Carson was taping his show from a studio directly downstairs. The reels on a single ordinary video tape recorder of 1960's vintage turned silently, except for a slight periodic brushing sound, indicating that, like similar machines in local stations throughout the country, one reel was slightly out of round. <BR> <BR>Here was something else I couldn't believe. The Tonight Show was being taped on a single ordinary studio recorder. Nothing special, no backup. If I had reached over and stuck my finger in one of the reels, I would have brought the famous Tonight Show with its small army of cast and crew, including one of television's greatest stars, to its knees for that day. Of course, had I done that, I'd probably still be making little rocks out of big ones someplace. <BR> <BR>Nonetheless, it all seemed so vulnerable somehow. But the people who work at the top of the industry, like those in small local markets, come to take both the demands and the circumstances of their work for granted. To a point. <BR> <BR>Interestingly, I remember asking if they recycled the tapes, and I was surprised to learn that they did. This was Johnny Carson's Tonight Show, for heaven's sake, one of television's brightest lights, and they're not saving the shows? Later, I would read that Carson has always resented that, for reasons of simple economy, NBC did not save most of the early programs, which are now lost forever. Years and years of wonderful creative work gone. Forever. All to save the cost of tape in an economy where a half minute of commercial time costs as much as somebody's house. <BR> <BR>Nineteen-ninety-five is generally acknowledged to have been the 75th anniversary of radio in the United States, and, while television's technological roots go back to the 19th century, the commercial TV industry in the U.S. awaited the end of W. W. II and the introduction of the image orthicon tube, the heart of the modern TV camera. Thus, while it's somewhat arbitrary, I suppose we can say that commercial television in the United States is just about now completing its first 50 years, as well. I started in radio during the first half of its history, and began dabbling in television only a few years after it burst on the American scene, although, by that time, tens of millions of sets had been sold. <BR> <BR>Anyone of my generation who has had anything to do with protecting a broadcast license, managing a broadcast facility, performing on the air, or who has sat for an FCC license exam, certainly grew up with the Communications Act of 1934. Most of us had major parts of it memorized. It defined the rules by which American broadcasting has functioned over all the years since, and it created the Federal Communications Commission. <BR> <BR>We were admonished to operate in the "public convenience, interest, and necessity." We had to carefully watch what we said on the air, if we wanted to renew our station license. We had to provide equal time to political candidates. There were all sorts of do's and don'ts, and people at all levels of the business were quite familiar with them. In the early days, it was even illegal to use the public airways to relay personal messages. Thus, quiz show contestants on early network radio were reminded that they could not say "hello to Uncle Mortimer." <BR> <BR>Of course, there has been much de-regulation of the broadcast industry during recent years. It has made Howard Stern, Gordon Liddy, Rush Limbaugh, and nationally televised presidential debates possible, among other things. You may remember that it was sixteen years after the first televised presidential debates in 1960 before we had another one. That was because of the old "equal time" requirement incumbent on local television stations by virtue of their license requirements at the time. All that has changed. <BR> <BR>De-regulation made possible an escalation of the vividness of television images needed to hold the attention of an increasingly bored, media-saturated audience, particularly images relating to sex, violence, and the use of taboo or violent language. Theatrical films are still ahead of television in what they can show, but not too far ahead, assuming that "ahead" is the right way of putting it. <BR> <BR>I'm a parent, and I've never had the slightest desire to fill my children's bodies or minds with toxic garbage. Many people worry about the effect of the media on children, and there <CITE>is</CITE> a problem. However, it is a problem for which parents and others with legitimate child care obligations should be responsible, aided by information plus technological devices which almost surely can be developed for effectively filtering media content. If there can be a technological solution to children and television-the "V-chip"-surely there can be a similar solution with respect to the Internet. <BR> <BR>When parents control what their children are exposed to, it is a part of normal, conscientious parenting, not censorship. It is censorship only when governments do it, and that is as dangerous as a blowtorch near a gas tank. Today, the so-called "dirty words." Tomorrow, opinions critical of those in power. The day after, totalitarianism. <BR> <BR>Peter Drucker, who defies easy categorization into the "liberal" vs. "conservative" dichotomy, has written a new magazine piece in which he says that the "political correctness" stuff on some American campuses is inherently totalitarian in attitude, and I agree. The last time such an ill wind blew across the campuses, he says, was in the late '30s and early '40's, but, then, it was Stalinist. <BR> <BR>I'm not old enough to remember that, but I do have some memory of the McCarthy period, and I clearly remember some of the less attractive aspects of campus life during the 1960's. There were the large piles of Mao's silly, pretentious, and dishonest little red book that quickly sold out in the Michigan State University bookstore. It was another period, like our own, during which the capacity for critical thinking seemed to be suspended, even at a great university. <BR> <BR>At about the same time, I was under strong pressure to cancel my classes in order to contribute to the <CITE>appearance</CITE> of a spontaneous campus-wide student strike to protest the Cambodian incursion and Kent State shootings. I disliked the Cambodian invasion, and hated the Kent State shootings. Still, I felt that there were people on the campus at the time who were in danger of forgetting which country they lived in. I held classes as usual, and it did not make me popular with many persons in our department and elsewhere on the campus. <BR> <BR>You are unlikely to see much offensive content on this site, unless you are offended by ideas, and many people are. We are not "shock jocks," and this is not intended to be "tabloid web." Nonetheless, we will not take kindly to anyone, including the government, telling us what we should or should not say here or anyplace else. Anybody who wants to try can simply, well, go straight to heck, if their ears are tender. If that's not clear enough, I'm capable of putting it in terms that are considerably more colorful. <BR> <BR>There is a strong sense in which media simply reflect the increasing baseness, coarseness, rudeness, and dangerousness of American social life. It has infected political discourse in recent years too, giving us "in your face" national political figures. For example, the Republican party recently certainly hasn't looked like the party of Rockefeller, Scranton, Romney, or Eisenhower, let alone Lincoln. It hasn't been the party of Bush or Nixon either, if you ignore Nixon's psychiatric and character problems for the moment, and concentrate on his policies, many of which could have been part of a Democratic administration. It hasn't even been the party of Goldwater lately, as my colleague and former Republican, Dr. Ken Taylor, has pointed out. At the very least, Goldwater is a decent and honest man. <BR> <BR>Similarly, the Democratic party of recent years has not greatly resembled the party responsible for bringing about some of the more important reforms of this or any other century. Many recent Democrats must accept some responsibility for being too arrogantly casual about things that matter greatly to large numbers of ordinary citizens, and, in the process, courting the horrors of reaction, a hint of which we have seen recently. <BR> <BR>Some of contemporary American politics has the familiar putrid stench of European politics in the 1930's when gangsters won control of governments while, all the time, invoking familiar, comforting symbolism, religious and otherwise. Is Pat Buchanan our Zhirinovsky, except slicker because he's worked so much on television? Since the New Hampshire primary, Zhirinovsky himself has been quoted as saying that he thinks Buchanan is pretty nifty. That might be too rough a translation from the original Russian, but it captures the general idea. <BR> <BR>There is banality, not only in evil, but also in coarse, assaultive behavior that attempts to bludgeon its way into our consciousness. Maybe all this has gone about as far as it can go before beginning to sink under its own weight. Maybe people will tire of the monotonous drum beat of rudeness, crudity, depravity, and violence in all its forms. <BR> <BR>Howard Stern's act and Madonna's act may be offensive, but mostly they're just stupid, confining, and boring, boring, boring, surely not liberating. They're intended to appeal mostly to persons whose development leveled off somewhere in early adolescence, or who are willing to settle for so little, despite life's grand possibilities. It's like visiting the Taj Mahal and being preoccupied with its sewer system. <BR> <BR>All the recent changes in the media will pale in comparison to those on the horizon as a consequence of the new omnibus telecommunications bill recently signed into law by President Clinton, with or without the "V-chip," and with or without efforts to censor the Internet's content. For the first time in more than sixty years, the Communications Act of 1934 is not part of our lives. <BR> <BR>It's a whole brave new media world too, and we will see the broad outlines of 21st century American life emerge during the years immediately ahead. As in the new work world, the unfamiliarity is unnerving. We don't know what to do, but we feel we must do something. The danger is in doing too much too early or in doing all the wrong things. <BR> <BR>We'll see a very rapid acceleration of the grand convergence of industries and technologies that has already been going on; but most unfamiliar to most people, including politicians, is the Internet, because there has never been anything else quite like it. <BR> <BR>Politicians around the world are nervous about the Internet, not simply because it is unfamiliar, and certainly not because people may use it to express the kinds of things that are freely expressed on television or on the telephone, but also because it threatens their own positions. Just as so many middle management jobs have become obsolete and irrelevant in the modern corporation, so are many political and bureaucratic roles made pointless when people can decide and do for themselves. Those who are dependent on privileges attached to traditional roles are greatly annoyed by these developments. One is reminded of the look on Nicolae Ceausescu's face in 1989 when he first realized that the crowd he was addressing was not responding in the familiar manner. Similar efforts to limit expression on the Internet are occurring in Germany and in China, as well as in other countries. <BR> <BR>Social organization has always been determined in large part by who can talk to whom about what under what conditions, and persons with a vested interest in hierarchical authoritarian arrangements have always done their best to limit open communication either by threats, intimidation, or claims that such restrictions are ordained by God. Institutional structure that has seemed rock solid can suddenly dissolve when nearly everything can relate to nearly everything else. <BR> <BR>A society's "informal organization" is more important than its "formal organization," because, in the long-run, informal organization determines what the formal organization will be. Not only have the possible patterns of informal interaction been increased exponentially by the Internet, geography has been made largely irrelevant as well, including many geographical boundaries. <BR> <BR>Among other things, with the new technologies, direct democracy, as opposed to representative republican forms of government, may now be possible in huge societies for the first time, not just in the New England town meetings or the smaller communities of Classical Greece. This brings to mind liberating images of greater democratization, but also images of mass impulse or intemperate mob rule. Freedom always carries risks, and an enlargement of options is a way of increasing freedom. It is a condition ripe for anxiety as well as exhilaration or euphoria. <BR> <BR>Our society is not the only one professing a basic commitment to free expression. However, each democracy has its own delicate equilibrium. In our own case, the 1st Amendment to our Constitution is the prop supporting the rest of the structure. Because of the inherent relationship between thought and expression, what controls expression eventually controls thought, which, in turn, controls patterns of behavior throughout the system. Free and open communication has always been the enemy of despotism everywhere. <BR> <BR>I have little enthusiasm for the corrosive, dehumanizing stuff that many people refer to as "pornographic" (there is no official definition of pornography, and much is in the eye of the beholder), but I'm as near to an absolutist on the 1st Amendment as anyone should be able to imagine. It has been the foundation of all of our freedoms for two centuries, and I'm willing to accept disgusting expressions as the price we must pay in order to enjoy the benefits of a democracy. The alternatives are unthinkable, but this has been a century in which the unthinkable has become thinkable repeatedly. As unpleasant as the noise, rudeness, and raucousness can be, these are also the sweet music of a free society. <BR> <BR>In recent years, within an increasingly ugly and polarized political climate, the 1st Amendment has been under increasing pressure from both the political left and the right in the United States. Nonetheless, any effort to limit or weaken it immediately puts us on a slippery slope. As hair-raising as human social arrangements can be, we'll be all right, so long as we hold the 1st Amendment firmly in place. There is no greater priority as we determine the supporting conditions of American life during the 21st century. <BR> <BR>My long and quite weird career so far might seem, on the surface, to include a number of activities having little relationship to one another, except possibly contradictory. I've spent more than forty years doing broadcasts of various kinds, helping to run radio stations, building a broadcast news department, performing, lecturing, writing, teaching, consulting. <BR> <BR>What ties most of these things together across commercial, professional, and academic contexts, is almost continuous involvement with the 1st Amendment in some way or another. My work in all these contexts has been absolutely dependent on it. <BR> <BR>I've been aware of this all along, but this awareness was reinforced by living and working in a variety of other countries over much of the globe for several years, including some in which one could not take freedom of expression for granted, to put it in the mildest possible manner. <BR> <BR>I lived in Spain while Franco was still alive and in power, as well as in Taiwan while Chiang still essentially called the shots, despite his great age. Tito was still firmly in power while we were in what used to be called Yugoslavia. There was always a chill in the air in these places, as well as quiet tension. In totalitarian societies, people are required to pretend they are far more alike than they really are, which is to say that they are prevented from fulfilling the essential uniqueness that defines a human personality. <BR> <BR>Will our next Administration not only censor the Internet, but also burn the books and arrest the scholars if it can? Mr. Buchanan already has railed against "the academics" who are trying to poison the minds of our children and steal the soul of our country. When the intellectual leadership of American conservatives seemed to pass from the brilliant and informed William Buckley and the brilliant and informed George Will to Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich, we should have suspected that we were in trouble. But this is something else altogether. Pat Buchanan is not a genuine conservative, and he is not a genuine Republican either. <BR> <BR>While he's dominating the front pages in the U.S. as this is written, Buchanan's prominence is a product of the current ugly and dangerous political climate in the United States. He's not the only one who would standardize American life according to a simple recipe. He's simply more extreme than some of the others and a more skillful propagandist. There are many people in the American Congress who regard a commitment to tolerance, open-mindedness, or critical thinking themselves as "too liberal." Have we learned nothing whatever from history, even from the most recent past? <BR> <BR>Like many who are unnerved by change and the unfamiliar, Mr. Buchanan says that he wants a return to the "clarity and absolutes" of his childhood as he remembers it. Well, Mr. Buchanan, if you want to see only clarity and absolutes in social life, you will have to invent them, or mindlessly accept ones invented by others, because, in most cases, they cannot be discovered. Humanity will have to muddle through as it has always done, even during the mythical "good old days." Moreover, if the rest of us say that we see your absolutes with such clarity, as in the case of your intellectual predecessors, it will only be because you have the power to force us to pretend, and, as a consequence, kill all creativity. <BR> <BR>He also says that he wants a country that is guided only by the laws of God. If we are to take him at his word, this can only mean that he will never, in good conscience, be able to take an oath to "preserve, protect, and defend" the Constitution of the United States. <br> <center><b><A HREF="Gary.html">Gary G.

Harris and Sharon L. Jones<br><br> The Parent's Crash Course in Career Planning: <BR> Helping Your College Student Succeed <br> <br>VGM Career Horizons, 1996</b></center> <br> You're a parent of a college student or have a son or daughter approaching college age. You've heard all the horror stories about people with undergraduate or graduate degrees working in jobs not requiring any college at all. You've heard about &quot;downsizing,&quot; &quot;restructuring,&quot; &quot;outsourcing,&quot; &quot;job shock,&quot; &quot;the end of work,&quot; and how the work world seems to be turning upside down, and it's all giving you a world-class headache. <br><br>You're painfully aware of the tremendous cost of higher education compared to when you were in school. You're feeling that the student in your family may be embarking on a treacherous journey across a minefield characterized more by costs and risks than benefits. You're wondering if college is even worth doing anymore, and what, if anything, can be done to help your young scholar succeed in a bewildering and unfamiliar work world.<br><br>Well, just in time, here's welcome help from two highly experienced experts. Finally, here's a book for concerned, bewildered parents. Here's informed advice, and here's a solid basis for optimism, despite all the turbulence. Yes, your student can succeed, and, yes, you can help.<br><br>Marcia Harris and Sharon Jones are in charge of career services at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, one of the world's great research universities which also serves thousands of young people every year, including beginners. The authors know higher education, and they know young students. They also know the new work world. Bookstores are filled with career books that seem oriented to the work world of 1975 or so. This is not one of them. This is a book for today's college students and their families, and for today's economy.<br><br>This is a brief, practical guide book providing a readable overview of important issues and resources, and including abundant informed advice. It is a problem-solving guide that tells about the implications of various choices all along the way. What kinds of things should your student be concentrating on during the first year of college, the second, the third or fourth? What do employers want? How important are grades, choice of college major, extracurricular activities, or part-time work? What kinds of preparation are more likely to lead to a satisfying career path? What are the principal risk factors? How do the successful students succeed, and how can one avoid the dead-ends? What are the best ways to go about the job search? What makes a good resume? The book provides help on all these issues and more. A lot is packed into its 200 pages, and it is a pleasant and informative read.<br><br>The fact is that, despite all the news reports and scare stories, college still makes a difference in the work world, and most college graduates do eventually find satisfactory jobs following graduation. True, the college degree, by itself, no longer guarantees much; but, in an economy heavily populated by graduates, your son or daughter may be at a significant disadvantage without one. With so many graduates available, there is no particularly good reason for employers to hire persons without degrees. A degree can at least help you survive the first cut. Given the supply-demand relationships in the new economy, a college degree may be necessary, but not sufficient. <br><br>Also true: employers are far more interested in actual competencies than credentials now, which can be both good news and bad news. If you're expecting that your degree alone will be enough for success, forget it. Anyway, why should we expect that someone will want to pay you because you're cultured and understand the world around you, anymore than for being a nice person? Usually, employers are interested in paying for getting things done. <br><br>On the other hand, if you do have the skills an employer needs, however you've acquired them, you're less likely to have your liberal arts major held against you than in previous years. Harris and Jones provide wise advice about the relative importance of course work and other experiences. According to the authors, while employers are not indifferent to the general education of their employees, they want employees who also have specific skills of interest, leadership experience, and relevant work experience.<br><br>The authors discuss &quot;hot careers,&quot; and they provide some cautions. They briefly summarize occupational outlook data from the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics and other sources, indicating some of the best guesses about relative demand and likely pay in a number of occupational categories. Wisely, they recommend that, while no one wants to prepare for a dying occupation, growth patterns or likely demand should not be the determining factors in occupational choice. Career choices should reflect, not only an assessment of the job market, but also, perhaps more importantly, an assessment of oneself.<br><br>We have two college students in our family, so I decided to read this book myself. Once I sat down with it, it didn't take long to decide that our daughters could benefit from it directly. I left it in a conspicuous place, thinking they might pick it up and browse through. Failing this, I gently suggested that it might be something they'd be interested in and find helpful. There was not much response. Neither has looked at it over the months since. They simply will not pick it up.<br><br>In fact, there is little about the book that will be of interest only to parents of college students, as opposed to the students themselves. It really is something that students should also read. However, I think the word &quot;parent's&quot; in the title is absolutely deadly, so far as young people are concerned. We may as well tell them that they should listen to &quot;their father's music.&quot; People shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but they often do.<br><br>I suggest another edition called &quot;The student's crash course in career planning.&quot; It could be the same book, but without the references to &quot;your child,&quot; and so on. It should be in every college bookstore under the revised title. It could include a suggestion that students ask their parents to read it.<br><br>Ideally, college and career planning for young people should be a family enterprise. In many cases, family involvement is necessary for dealing with the financial aspects of it. This book takes a significant step toward encouraging broader family participation as well, and can help parents, whose own careers have been conducted mostly in the old economy, become familiar with the work world faced by their children. <br><br>Targeting the current edition to parents is a good idea, because there surely is a need. I recommend it to parents enthusiastically and entirely without reservation. My only concern is that students themselves may not read it, and they should. <BR> <BR> <BR> <center><b>Gary G.

It includes much from the general and business press, as well as popular and business books. However, there is also a voluminous literature from many professional and academic fields, including economics, labor/industrial relations, industrial psychology, marketing, management, career testing and counseling, and many others.</blockquote><p><blockquote>Everyone who will be affected by the changes in the revolutionary new world economy-and that's everyone-probably should become a student of these changes and read regularly. However, it's unrealistic to expect most people who have other responsibilities-and that's nearly everyone-to keep up with all that's happening. You won't have to. That's part of what <em>we're</em> for.</blockquote><p><blockquote>Before long, you'll find reviews on this page-reviews of books, television programs, software, just about anything that's relevant to your life and work in the new economy. If you would like us to consider your book or software for review here or elsewhere, <A HREF ="Submissions.html">please send us a copy for examination</A>. If you have professional expertise in an area related to the new work world and would like to write a review, please contact us as well, describing your professional interests, areas of expertise, credentials, and affiliations.</blockquote><p><blockquote>One of the hottest areas of concern right now is the rapidly changing job market. However, as important and fundamental as these changes are, we won't be focusing on them exclusively. TNWC is about <em>all</em> aspects of the world of work, and you'll see this reflected in our reviews and other offerings.</blockquote><p>Now and then, when I've been referred to in the press, I've been called a "futurist," which is better than some of the things I might be called, I suppose. Nonetheless, the term has a quaint 1970's sound to it at this point. Many recent books describe current changes and speculate about the future. <p>Much of the futures literature from the '70's and early '80's was a bit intemperate, adopting either a "gee-whiz" or apocalyptic attitude which seemed to reflect the adversarial approach of court procedure, partisan politics, and much of contemporary journalism. TV news seems to assume that if they get one "expert" who says he believes in gravity, they've got to find another who will say he doesn't, and, then, call that "balance." The truth seems to be that polarized adversarial approaches are unlikely to be very instructive, and one might be skeptical of their ability to uncover anything resembling "truth" in any case. Yes, I recognize how this will sound to attorneys.<p>We respond to things in terms of how they look to us, and context and perspective help determine how they look. Perspective is very important, including historical perspective. History isn't dead: putting things into historical perspective influences how they look to us in the present, and this helps determine how we will respond to them. I recently made another trip to the British Museum simply in order to look and think and study and better inform several media and writing projects I'm involved in, most of which are intended to relate to the future somehow.<p>Conclusions drawn from the limited perspective of daily life are almost always inadequate and frequently flat-out wrong, even though they may be highly popular for awhile. This should make us cautious of feverish, sweaty contagions, including those in the current American political climate. Many people are highly enthusiastic about something they refer to as "common sense," and many pride themselves as being "no-nonsense." However, on close examination, we may find that some of the more common and popular ideas about work and most other things are <em>mostly</em> nonsense, including many highly traditional as well as many trendy things that come along on a regular basis.<p>"Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect," George Santayana said, and that's for sure. Do study your future in the new economy, but proceed cautiously through all that's available for you to consider. Virtually every possible point of view is available, so you can choose what is most comfortable to believe, if you like, as is usually done in partisan political arguments. However, if you choose to look through a "filter," you <em>know</em> how things are going to look, no matter how they really are. As Thomas Aquinas remarked, "Beware the man of one book." Read the "futurists" from the 1970's now, and it will appear that their job security depends in large part on our having the memories of barnyard geese.<p>There are a lot of things worth reading now, and some of them are listed below. However, our sense is that most of it still lacks sufficient perspective. For instance, you'll notice that most of the really apocalyptic book titles relating to jobs and the job market have already been taken. Nonetheless, more than thirty suggestions follow, in alphabetical order by author, with brief comments added by myself.<p><center><strong><em>Gary Johnson<br>October 1995</em></strong></center><p><p><p><dl><b><dt>Aronowitz, Stanley and William DiFazio. <em>The Jobless Future: Sci-Tech and the Dogma of Work.</em> University of Minnesota Press, 1994.</b><dd>A book by two sociologists, and certainly not very optimistic; but they do make a powerful and interesting case. They are skeptical of the knowledge-based, high-tech workplace and what it promises. They see massive degradation and displacement of the workforce at all levels. Their prescriptions will trouble many, but perhaps it is time to examine some of our most fundamental social and political assumptions.<p>Are we really facing catastrophe? Maybe. Genuine catastrophes have occurred in earth history and also during the history of civilization. The calamitous 14th century comes to mind. However, I'm also reminded of the infamous so-called "Club of Rome Report" during the 1970's. According to its computer models and scholarly projections, everything should have collapsed totally long before now. Problem is, they underestimated the impact of technological innovation, which may have saved us from the expected fate, and which is accused of bringing on our demise now. See my remarks about technology in my response to Jeremy Rifkin, below.<p>This book should not be dismissed out of hand, though, simply because the authors' conclusions may not feel good or may not be consistent with one's preconceptions. These are bright, conscientious people, and they've done a lot of homework.<p><b><dt>Barber, Elizabeth Wayland. <em>Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years.</em> Norton, 1994.</b><dd>When you tire of having the daylights scared out of you either by Steven King or by what you've been reading about the job market, try this as an antidote. Through most of history and prehistory until quite recently, women's work, in addition to child-rearing, usually has involved either food or clothing. This book is mostly about women and cloth. It is a fascinating history based on state-of-the-art archeological research.<p><b><dt>Boyett, Joseph H. & Henry P. Conn. <em>Workplace 2000: The Revolution Re-Shaping American Business.</em> Dutton, 1991.</b><p><p><b><dt>Boyett, Joseph H., et al. <em>Beyond Workplace 2000: Essential Strategies for the New American Corporation.</em> Dutton, 1995.</b><dd>Two books by Boyett and his co-authors, mostly from the point of view of corporations attempting to cope with the new economy. Competent overview of what seems to be happening, as well as practical advice. <p>Incidentally, these should not be confused with <em>Workforce 2000</em>, the report published several years ago by the Hudson Institute that was so enthusiastically received by academe. This report predicted a tremendous labor shortage, particularly of the college educated, a view that seems a bit peculiar at this point, and shows some of the dangers of extrapolating or using actuarial prediction when underlying conditions have changed. The Hudson Institute was founded by Herman Kahn, the man who invented the Rand Corporation years ago, and, in the process, largely invented private "think-tanks."<p>It should be noted that there are spot labor shortages at the present time in some technical areas not necessarily requiring conventional college education, despite large displacements in others.<p><b><dt>Cardwell, Donald. <em>The Norton History of Technology.</em> W. W. Norton & Company, 1995.</b><dd>Part of an interesting looking series, this book provides historical perspective on the current technological revolution. I've read only about a third of it so far, but intend to finish it as soon as I can. <p>While we regard technology as resting on science now, technology really predates science. Although with classical Greek roots, modern science has developed mostly during the past few centuries, as humanity has learned to bring concepts, mathematical or otherwise, together with observations of empirical reality in highly systematic and powerful ways. <p>Of course, as our knowledge of nature has increased exponentially, so has our ability to apply this knowledge to practical problems and concerns. The modern technological explosion has resulted from but also has helped to fuel the explosion in scientific research and knowledge. The relationship between modern science and technology doesn't go only one way, but, instead, is interactive.<p>Nonetheless, technology began in prehistory. It seems to be in the nature of humanity to <em>do</em> things, to be tool maker and tool user, to act on and influence the environment in ways that serve perceived human needs and purposes. <p>This is an academic, not a popular book, but it is quite readable.<p><b><dt>Charland, William. <em>Career Shifting: Starting Over in a Changing Economy.</em> Adams, 1993.</b><p><b><dt>Coltham, James. <em>Career Shock.</em> Berkeley, 1992.</b><dd>Two books briefly noted. Can be useful to individuals, particularly if you have not read any of the other books on this list. Some coverage of familiar territory. The first is intended particularly for persons who have been displaced in mid-career.<p><b><dt>Crawford, Richard. <em>In the Era of Human Capital: The Emergence of Talent, Intelligence, and Knowledge as the Worldwide Economic Force and What it Means to Managers and Investors.</em> HarperCollins, 1991.</b><dd>Competent overview by an experienced management consultant. Surveys what appears to be happening; then, looks at implications for business and management, as well as the financial markets. Mostly for business people and investors who want to make high-quality practical decisions based on current trends. Brief, readable. Not all that bad. <p>Not all that good either, if you want a deeper understanding with broad perspective, which is what we'll all need in the long-run. We all want our physicians to be very thorough and highly sophisticated-sophisticated not like Ivana Trump, but like the Mayo Clinic. We need no less in other complex areas of life.<p><b><dt>Dent, Harry S. <em>The Great Boom Ahead.</em> Hyperion, 1993.</b><p><b><dt>Dent, Harry S. <em>Job Shock: Four New Principles Transforming Our Work and Business.</em> St. Martin's Press, 1995</b><dd>Despite the implications of the title of his latest book, here's one of the optimists for people who may have learned from Steven Covey to like lists. Another management consultant who seems to know his business, but don't look for scholarly analysis or deep insights. <p><b><dt>Drucker, Peter. <em>The New Realities: In Government and Politics, in Economics and Business.</em> Harper & Row, 1989.</b><p><b><dt>Drucker, Peter. <em>Post-Capitalist Society.</em> HarperBusiness, 1993.</b><dd>If, like Japan, we recognized living national treasures, Peter F. Drucker would surely be among them. <p>The wonderful Mr. Drucker largely invented management consulting about fifty years ago with his landmark analysis of General Motors, and is often given credit for helping to invent professional management as a discipline. Over the years since, he has produced a continuing series of highly provocative books analyzing management, business, and socioeconocultural life generally. <p>His broad perspective is a consequence of his enormous erudition and astonishing talent combined with his great years. Now nearing ninety, Peter Drucker's crystal clear memory encompasses most of the 20th century, and his powers and penetrating insight seem undiminished. I believe he is significant far beyond the corporate world with which he has been identified, and I'm delighted that we still have the benefit of his instruction during this historic period symbolized by the imminent end of the millennium. The familiar world is dissolving before our eyes, to be swept away. A new world-exciting, unfamiliar, frightening-is taking its place. Drucker is as good a tour guide as any.<p>If you want perspective, read Drucker; but, don't read Drucker if you insist on looking at the world through a stereotypical caricature of either "liberal" or "conservative" thought, because, sooner or later, he will infuriate you in either case. Not for "fuzzy-headed crackpot liberals" or for "Limbeciles" either. He soars far above partisan dichotomies and insults.<p>One of the reasons that Peter Drucker is so interesting, provocative, and valuable may be that, despite his having been a professor in several disciplines over many years, he is not a product of the conventional academic culture. When he completed secondary school in Europe, rather than going to college, he simply went to work. It was while he was working as a newspaper reporter in Frankfurt that he began night school. Later, while still young, he worked as a senior economist for a major London bank, although I don't believe he holds a degree in economics.<p>Drucker has written dozens of books, beginning with <em>The End of Economic Man</em> in the 1930's. Two of his latest are listed above, but don't stop with them. <p><b><dt>Hakim, Cliff. <em>We are All Self-Employed: Achieving Independence, Collaboration, and Fulfillment Inside or Outside Organizations.</em> Berrett-Koehler 1994.</b><dd>Quite interesting and up-to-date. This is among a small group of career books that are rapidly making most conventional career books obsolete. An interview with Mr. Hakim appears in the August 15, 1994 edition of <em>Industry Week</em> magazine.<p><b><dt>Handy, Charles. <em>The Age of Unreason.</em> Harvard Business School Press, 1990.</b><p><b><dt>Handy, Charles. <em>The Age of Paradox.</em> Harvard Business School Press, 1994.</b><dd>Charles Handy is a British professor and consultant who has been very influential on both sides of the Atlantic. He accurately anticipated the form that many corporations would begin taking in his 1990 book, but his latest book also contains some reconsiderations. Both are very much worth a read. <p>Incidentally, leading American industrial psychologist Warren Bennis has written the preface for the first book. Bennis was a university president for a brief period, and was last seen running from the campus screaming and tearing at his hair. Kidding, but only slightly. He's written about the experience.<p><b><dt>Heilbroner, Robert. <em>21st Century Capitalism.</em> Norton, 1993.</b><dd>A recent look into the future by one of our major economists, known to millions of college students as the author of <em>The Worldly Philosophers</em>, a modern classic that probably will endure for generations. He wrote a book a few years ago called <em>An Inquiry into the Human Prospect</em>, which should not be read when already depressed.<p><b><dt>Kotter, John. <em>The New Rules: How to Succeed in Today's Post-Corporate World</em>. Free Press, 1995.</b><dd>Haven't read it, but it looks interesting. Will try to get to it soon.<p><p><a name="mcrae.html"<p><b><dt>McRae, Hamish. <em>The World in 2020: Power, Culture and Prosperity</em>. Harvard Business School Press, 1994.</b><dd>For those who wish a global perspective, this is an important book. It should be read by business, education, and governmental leaders in North America, Europe, and East Asia, in particular, because it may tell you about your future. Mr. McRae assesses where the world stands now, the forces for change, and how things will stand twenty-five years from now, in the year 2020. <p>For example, assuming no large scale catastrophes, he finds it difficult to envision a realistic scenario by which China will <em>not</em> have the world's largest economy by 2020. This will give it a commensurate amount of political influence in the world community as well, something that is likely to trouble many persons in Western-style democracies. However, it's unlikely that the political system in its present form will be able to withstand the enormous economic changes that are occurring. In fact, the fast-growth economic zones are already becoming semi-autonomous political entities. China will not necessarily survive as a single, centralized political system.<p>There are major differences among the three major economic regions of the world. On average, Europe has the greatest government participation in social welfare, East Asia the least, North America somewhere in between. <p>America sends a larger proportion of its population into post-secondary education, but with results that are a mixture of the best, the mediocre, and the worst (not necessarily correlated with cost or size and reputation of the institution, incidentally). East Asia, modeling Japan's rote approach to K-12 education, tends to produce high levels of performance, at least narrowly defined, but without fostering the high levels of individual creativity and judgment that will be increasingly key to economic success. The best of North America's graduate schools probably remain the best in the world, and will continue to attract high levels of participation from other parts of the world, at least for awhile, so America will continue to be a higher ed "exporter." <p>The most dramatic rates of economic growth have occurred in East Asia, first in Japan, then Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea, most recently in China; but, while the boom continues, it is fragile, according to McRae. For one thing, despite the American and European tendency toward stereotypical thinking with regard to Asians, instead of being "mostly alike," the truth is that there is far more diversity of nearly every sort in East Asia than in either North America or Europe. An integrated "Asian economy" will not happen soon, because there are so many people there who have so little in common, culturally, historically, or in most other ways. <p>Also, during the past half century, Americans have gone from demonizing the Japanese to idealizing or romanticizing their industrial prowess. Neither is realistic. As a people, they are simply human beings, made out of the same stuff as the rest of us; economically, it's easy to exaggerate their infallibility, or the extent to which their techniques will transfer to other settings. Also, it's easy to exaggerate the breadth, depth, or durability of Japan's economic "miracle," although, at least in the short run, Japan will probably be the world's banker and venture capitalist.<p>America saves the least, reflecting both its relative lack of discipline and its optimism. Its high level of consumption helps support East Asia's dependence on the American market, and contributes to the current trade imbalance, as well as the fragility of the East Asian boom. Higher levels of savings provide an important source of capital to finance high rates of growth in Asia; but, as Drucker points out, a particular type of savings, pension funds, have largely financed American business during recent years as well. <p>I've traveled quite a bit during the past year or so, both domestically and internationally. For example, I arrived in Seoul in late June 1994, about the time <em>U.S. News & World Report</em> was running a cover story about Korea as "the most dangerous place on earth." I had lived in South Korea briefly during the early '70's, and I was struck by the dramatic economic changes that are reflected in their astonishing statistics. In the early '70's, South Korea really was a poor third-world country; now it is a modern industrial giant with the fifteenth economy in the world, all in a space about two-thirds the size of North Dakota. A remarkably bright, industrious people have created wonders. <p>However, as McRae points out, one of the sources of East Asian economic fragility is the relative weakness of their infrastructure, which, in order to foster immediate growth, has been neglected, but which will be needed for the long haul. This problem is apparent in South Korea. For example, Seoul has a tremendous air pollution problem, and there have been dramatic recent structural failures-e.g., bridges, buildings-that have resulted in great loss of life.<p>In short, I recommend this book. You might want to read it before reading any of the others, because we're all going to be living and working in a <em>global</em> economy from now on. More than ever before, events on a global scale will have consequences dribbling down to local communities, influencing individual situations. You must understand the tides, if you are to understand what is happening to the few gallons of water you're standing in.<p><b><dt>Naisbitt, John. <em>Megatrends: Ten Directions Transforming Our Lives.</em> Warner, 1982.</b><p><b><dt>Naisbitt, John and Patricia Aburdene. <em>Megatrends 2000: Ten New Directions for the '90's</em>. Avon, 1990.</b><p><b><dt>Aburdene, Patricia and John Naisbitt.<em> Megatrends for Women.</em> Villard, 1992.</b><p><b><dt>Naisbitt, John . <em>Global Paradox: The Bigger the World Economy, the More Powerful Its Smallest Players.</em> Morrow, 1994.</b><dd>John Naisbitt burned very brightly for a time following his 1982 book, but was dimmed slightly by criticisms of his research techniques, for which he appeared to be making rather extravagant and unjustified claims. It is true: the quality of our conclusions depends entirely on the quality of the methods used for reaching those conclusions, and whether or not a procedure is "objective" or even capable of being "objective" does not depend on somebody's <em>subjective</em> judgment.<p>Nonetheless, whether you accept his "trends" as resting on a solid factual foundation, or whether you regard them as interesting but tentative hypotheses (I prefer the latter), he and his co-author are provocative. <p><b><dt>Peters, Tom. <em>In Search of Excellence.</em> Harper and Row, 1982.</b><p><b><dt>Peters, Tom. <em>Thriving on Chaos.</em> Knopf, 1987.</b><p><b><dt>Peters, Tom. <em>Liberation Management: Necessary Disorganization for the Nanosecond Nineties.</em> Knopf, 1992.</b><dd>Tom Peters may be the most influential management consultant of the past fifteen years. He probably doesn't have everything right, but he is smart, speaks plain English, and is interesting and entertaining. He has been prominent among leaders who have recognized that traditional authoritarian hierarchies are obsolete and that fluid structure will be required from now on.<p><a name="reich.html"<p><b><dt>Reich, Robert. <em>Education and the Next Economy.</em> NEA, 1988.</b><p><b><dt>Reich, Robert. <em>The Work of Nations: Preparing Ourselves for 21st Century Capitalism.</em> Knopf, 1991.</b><p><b><dt>Reich, Robert. <em>Educating to Compete.</em> National videoconference underwritten by the Blackwell Corporation.</b><dd>Robert Reich is the current Secretary of Labor, recently of the Kennedy School at Harvard. Trained as a lawyer but widely recognized as a creative political economist, rumor has it that he is widely resented by economists at Harvard and MIT for not being a "real" economist. One might suspect that some mostly resent that he's Secretary of Labor and they're not. My own view is that the President of the United States probably should be able to have whomever he likes in his Cabinet. <p>However, some professors still haven't discovered that academe itself remains one of the last credentials-oriented outposts. The world off campus has become increasingly competence-oriented, performance-oriented, not credentials-oriented, and there is growing realization that there has never been more than a moderate relationship between so-called "credentials," on the one hand, and genuine competence and performance in most fields, on the other.<p>I don't agree with everything Reich has to say about work or education, but it shouldn't be necessary to do that in order to recognize a person's gifts and relevance. I fall slightly short of perfection myself. His 1991 book provides an extremely competent overview of the new economy. Still recommended.<p>I have not seen the videoconference, but it caught my eye, because the Blackwell Corporation is the underwriter and producer of public television's "TechnoPolitics" which often reflects a different point of view from Reich's. Let a zillion flowers bloom. This is an <em>historic</em> period we're going through, and it would be outrageous to expect that anybody has everything right at this early point. Nobody can even <em>see</em> all that's happening, let alone understand it all or anticipate all of its implications. This is not a time to limit ourselves.<p><b><dt>Rifkin, Jeremy. <em>The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era.</em> Putnam & Sons, 1995.</b><dd>Jeremy Rifkin is a very competent self-promoter, and I would be the last person to hold that against him. For years, he made a career out of being nervous about genetic engineering; but, considering that we are in one of earth history's major mass extinction periods (similar to that 65 million years ago when the dinos left us), there may be something to be nervous about. <p>Still, Jeremy seems to be all over the place. The fact that one of his early books was called <em>Entropy</em> may suggest the way he looks at things. The concept of "entropy" is from the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and, simply put, means that, in a closed system, everything eventually goes to hell. Problem is, the sorts of things with which TNWC is mostly concerned may not constitute a closed system in the ordinary sense, or, at least, not on a practical time scale. <em>Open</em> systems are ones sustained by inputs from the "outside," and a principal input in the case of the economic system seems to be technological innovation.<p>Most fundamentally, "technology" is not so much a matter of machines as the <em>use of knowledge</em>, and, of course, this implies the <em>appropriate</em> use of knowledge. One does not have to be a Luddite in order to be wary of inappropriate uses of technology. We don't have to adopt the sort of "all benefits, no costs or risks" attitude that predominated during the post-War era, particularly in the 1950's when Ronald Reagan worked for General Electric and kept emphasizing that progress was their "most important product." <p>While Reagan never seemed to recover from 1950's technological naivete&#180 -witness his "star wars" initiative, which apparently made most of his technical advisors faint dead away when he announced it-many others have moved far beyond Reagan's attitudes and Rifkin's as well. <p>It's very easy to exaggerate the advantages of being guided by uninformed judgment or passionate ignorance. To be a "techno-optimist" seems mostly a matter of being optimistic about those attributes that most define our humanity, and these are not our base instincts, capacities for prejudice and stupidity, or either paralyzing anxieties or excessive enthusiasms.<p>Fellow gloomarian Robert Heilbroner provides the preface to <em>The End of Work.</em> Again, I don't <em>know</em> that doom is not upon us at this very moment. However, while optimism doesn't always work, pessimism almost never does. I recall Dr. Alan Kay's remark that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. <p><b><dt>Slater, Philip. <em>A Dream Deferred: America's Discontent and the Search for a New Democratic Ideal.</em> Beacon, 1991.</b><dd>Philip Slater is a sociologist, and this is a very important book, brought to my attention by my colleague, Jerry Willenbring. It is not about work, as such, but surely is relevant to the way we organize our work, as well as the rest of our lives. <p>Slater examines the long history of authoritarian hierarchical social organization and recent attempts to invent a viable alternative, namely democracy, which he feels we have only so far roughly approximated, one painful step at a time-including a step or two backward at times. <p>Among other things, he claims that democracy is not only the only genuinely <em>just </em>way of organizing society (and its parts), but, also, that during a period of rapid and fundamental change, in particular, it is also the most <em>efficient</em> way of getting things done. <p>Tom Peters' "thriving on chaos," "destruction of hierarchy" notions come readily to mind. Authoritarian hierarchies don't give up easily, though, and a tremendous mythology has grown up around them, despite their tremendous inefficiencies and the disasters they have generated. Nonetheless, there is ample evidence that fluid, <em>ad hoc</em> structure seems to be the way the economy is going. One painful consequence of this transition is the reduction in the number of "jobs," as we have understood them. Peters has pointed out that, even though a larger proportion of the adult workforce is self-employed now than twenty years ago, it's still a far smaller proportion than at the turn of the century and before. What is the historical norm?<p>I don't think Slater's book had the impact that it should have had when it came out. It may have been a little ahead of its time, so now may be the perfect time to read it. However, as smart and wise as he is, I suspect that he's a bit too innocent politically for the current simplistic political climate in which, among other things, the First Amendment is under fire from both the right and the left, suggesting far too much preoccupation with words as opposed to ideas and things. He occasionally gratuitously uses words that will elicit reflexive responses from some readers and make it too easy for them to dismiss him without giving much thought. However, both genuinely smart "conservatives" and genuinely smart "liberals" will find a lot to think about here.<p><b><dt>Toffler, Alvin. <em>Future Shock.</em> Bantam, 1970.</b><p><b><dt>Toffler, Alvin. <em>The Third Wave.</em> Morrow, 1980.</b><p><b><dt>Toffler, Alvin. <em>Power Shift: Knowledge, Wealth, and Violence.</em></b>Bantam, 1990.<p><b><dt>Toffler, Alvin and Heidi Toffler. <em>Creating a New Civilization: The Politics of the Third Wave.</em> Turner, 1995.</b><dd>Like historian Will Durant many years ago, who finally added Ariel's name to the title page, Alvin Toffler has acknowledged the obvious and listed his wife Heidi as co-author. For quite a while, the Tofflers were producing a major influential book every ten years-<em>Future Shock</em> in 1970, <em>The Third Wave</em> in 1980, <em>Power Shift</em> in 1990. <p>However, they may be picking up the pace now. Their latest, which I have not read, has just recently hit the shelves and contains a forward by their longtime friend, Newt Gingrich. <p>Toffler didn't invent futures studies, but he did give "futurism" popularity, and probably remains the best known futurist in the world. It is sobering to think that when <em>Future Shock</em> was published in 1970, that major engine of modern change, the microprocessor, had not yet been released. <p>Nonetheless, I'm not sure what to think about the Tofflers. About the time I become convinced that Freudian psychology is dead and gone, I start to read about "repressed memories" in the newspaper every day and overhear Yuppies referring to somebody as "anal." <p>Similarly with all this "third wave" stuff. The Toffler book came out in 1980, but I'm sure I had been talking about similar things for years earlier, and I surely didn't invent those ideas. Now, "third wave" thinking seems to be the rage in Washington. It makes you wonder. Are there people there who still haven't heard about the Norman invasion?<p></dl><p><p><p><center><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="Previous_reviews.html"><b>Previous reviews</strong></A></center><p><center><hr width=200; size=5><FONT SIZE=+1><A HREF="default.html"><b>Return to top of home page</strong></A><p><FONT SIZE=+1><strong><A HREF="Today's_news.html">NewWork News</A> | <A HREF="Guest_commentary.html">Guest Commentary</A> | <A HREF="NewWork_reviews.html">Reviews</A> |<A HREF="Tech_watch.html">Tech Watch</A><br><A HREF="Ed_watch.html">Ed Watch</A> |<A HREF="Resources.html">Resources</A> | <A HREF ="Archives.html">Archives</A> | <A HREF ="Feedback.html">Feedback</A></FONT></strong></center><center><hr width=200; size=5></center><p><p><center><img src="LogoB.GIF" alt="[BraveNewWorkWorld and NewWork News are at http://www.newwork.com.

<P>MODUS: Die Themen werden jeweils in der letzten Woche vor den Semesterferien
im Rahmen einer kleinen Pr&auml;sentationsveranstaltung von den Betreuern
vorgestellt. Die Vergabe erfolgt direkt durch die Betreuer. Auseinandersetzung
mit den verschiedenen Themen bzw. Diskussion mit den Aufgabenstellern ist
ausdr&uuml;cklich erw&uuml;nscht. Es ist grunds&auml;tzlich freigestellt,
eine Diplom- oder Semesterarbeit im Rahmen der Vertiefung auch extern zu
machen.<BR>

Folgende F&auml;cherbelegung wird f&uuml;r eine grosse Vertiefung (Hauptfach)
empfohlen:

<BR>
Andere Kombinationen sind nat&uuml;rlich auch m&ouml;glich, es ist jedoch
nicht ratsam, die F&auml;cher E2 und E4 vorzuziehen.<BR>
<BR>
Die kleine Vertiefung (Nebenfach) besteht aus den vier Kernf&auml;chern
(K1 bis K4).<BR>
<BR>
Zus&auml;tzlich zu den Vertiefungsvorlesungen muss im Haupt- sowie im Nebenfach
eine <A HREF="http://troja.ethz.ch/Publik/Unterricht/SADA_Themen.html">Semesterarbeit</A>
durchgef&uuml;hrt werden. Sinnvollerweise sollte dies nach dem Vorhandensein
bestimmter Grundkenntnisse, also ab etwa dem sechsten Semester, geschehen.<BR>

Juristisches Neuland in den neuen Datennetzen

</FONT>
</Center>
Wenn von Datenautobahnen und vom Internet die Rede ist, stehen meist die enormen  
M&ouml;glichkeiten und Zukunftschancen im Vordergrund.  Die Berichte &uuml;ber H&auml;cker,  
Computerbetr&uuml;ger und Raubkopierer zeigen allerdings an, dass sich durch die neuen  
Transportwege f&uuml;r Daten etliche juristische Probleme ergeben.  Defizite bestehen  
insbesondere im Bereich der Strafverfolgung.Die Diskussion rechtlicher Probleme im  
Zeitalter der Datennetze beschr&auml;nkt sich meist auf Computerkriminalit&auml;t und Urheberrecht.   
Beides sind dankbare Themen angesichts der vielen Berichte &uuml;ber H&auml;cker,  
Computerbetr&auml;ger und Raubkopierer.  An juristischem Schutz fehlt es hier nicht: Seit  
Jahresbeginn erfasst das revidierte Verm&ouml;gensstrafrecht auch Computerdelikte.  Und ein  
Schutz des geistigen Eigentums besteht im Grunde schon seit langem, obwohl so mancher bis  
anhin nicht wahrhaben wollte, dass Urheberrechte eben auch im Cyberspace gelten (vgl. NZZ  
Nr. 164). <P>
Freilich geht es hier nicht nur um &lt;&lt;Inhalte&gt;&gt; Inzwischen werden die Gerichte sogar  
zum Schutz von Firmennamen in elektronischen Adressen eingespannt im Datennetz  
Intemet sind diese inzwischen so wichtig wie das Firmenschild an der Hauswand.  Um sich  
die Adresse mit dem Firmennamen zu sichern, muss diese aber bei den zust&auml;ndigen  
Registrationsdiensten angemeldet werden - und dem kann die Konkurrenz nat&uuml;rlich  
zuvorkommen.  Oder ein Dritter, der &lt;&lt;seine&gt;&gt; Adresse dann f&uuml;r viel Geld wieder verkauft.<P>
 
<H3>Unklarheiten beim Datenschutz</H3><P>
 
Neuland gilt es beim Datenschutz zu betreten.  Zwar existieren , griffige Bestimmungen  
zum Schutz des Einzelnen.  Auch hat der eidgen&ouml;ssische Datenschutzbeauftragte in seinem  
T&auml;tigkeitsbericht festgestellt dass vom Intemet durchaus Gefahren ausgehen.  Doch es  
scheint fraglich, ob dabei technisch tats&auml;chlich erfasst wurde, was in den Datennetzen  
derzeit abl&auml;uft.  Das aber w&auml;re n&ouml;tig, um Unerw&uuml;nschtem einen Riegel vorzuschieben.  So  
d&uuml;rfte beispielsweise ein Grossteil der Internet-Ben&uuml;tzer nicht wissen, dass Firmen, ohne  
um Erlaubnis zu bitten oder zu informieren, die elektronischen Adressen von Benutzern  
konsequent sammeln und zu Marketingzwecken &uuml;ber ihre Aktivit&auml;ten im Netz genau Buch  
fahren.  Der Verleger einer elektronischen Zeitung kann heute mit den geeigneten  
technischen Hilfsmitteln von jedem einzelnen Leser ein individuelles Pers&ouml;nlichkeitsprofil  
erstellen: Er weiss genau, wer welche Artikel abgerufen hat.<P>
 
<H3>Pers&ouml;nlichkeitsverletzungen</H3><P>
 
Kann in solchen F&auml;llen bei Missbr&auml;uchen gegen das Unternehmen vorgegangen werden,  
so ist dies bei Pers&ouml;nlichkeitsverletzungen sehr viel schwieriger.  Sie k&ouml;nnen im Intemet  
ohne weiteres stattfinden- Das Datennetz bietet Tausende von offenen Foren an, in denen  
sich jeder Teilnehmer &uuml;ber so gut wie jedes Thema &auml;ussern kann, wie und wann es ihm  
beliebt.  Eine verletzende Aeusserung kann von unz&auml;hligen andern Internet-Benutzer  
weltweit gelesen werden, ohne dass dies technisch zu verhindern w&auml;re; ein Einschreiten ist  
bestenfalls im nachhinein denkbar und auch dies nur in Ans&auml;tzen.<P>
Da es f&uuml;r einen Benutzer  
mit etwas Erfahrung m&ouml;glich ist, anonym zu operieren, ist ein R&uuml;ckgriff auf den Urheber  
nicht m&ouml;glich.  Die Situation im Intemet ist mit einer Zeitung zu vergleichen, in der jeder  
anonym, ungehindert und unzensuriert ver&ouml;ffentlichen kann, was er will.  Dabei hat er  
theoretisch eine Leserschaft von weltweit 40 Millionen Menschen, von denen manche  
unbesehen f&uuml;r wahr halten, was sie an ihrem Bildschirm aus dem Intemet ziehen.  Weil das  
Intemet lediglich das Ergebnis der Vernetzung von Zehntausenden von &lt;&lt;Sub-Netzen&gt;&gt;  
darstellt, existiert anders als etwa bei den kommerziellen Datendiensten (sog. &lt;&lt;Online&gt;&gt;- 
Dienste) kein Zentralorgan, das Verantwortung tr&auml;gt und einschreiten k&ouml;nnte.  Kann der  
Urheber einer pers&ouml;nlichkeitsverletzenden Aussage nicht ermittelt oder ergriffen werden,  
so ist das Opfer juristisch machtlos und muss sich dem &lt;&lt;Monster&gt;&gt; Internet f&uuml;gen. <P>
Aber auch  
bei kommerziellen Datendiensten wie etwa Compuserve oder America Online treten  
Schwierigkeiten auf.  Sind sie als Medien mit redaktioneller Verantwortung einzustufen  
oder als Anbieter von Kommunikationsdiensten, wie dies auch eine Telefongesellschaft ist?   
Die Schwarzen Bretter vieler Online-Dienste sind genauso offen wie das Intemet: Jeder kann  
mitteilen, was er will.  Bisher gelang es erst in einem Fall, gegen einen Online-Dienst  
vorzugehen, nachdem ein Benutzer den Namen einer Investmentbank verunglimpft hatte.   
Dem Dienst war die &lt;&lt;redaktionelle Betreuung&gt;&gt; zum Verh&auml;ngnis geworden, mit der erwarb:  
Er wurde einer Zeitung gleichgestellt.<P>
 
<H3>Enger Medienbegriff</H3><P>
 
Nach hiesigem Recht d&uuml;rfte jedoch bei elektronischen Datennetzen sogar das  
Gegendarstellungsrecht versagen.  Sie werden meist nicht als &lt;&lt;Medien&gt;&gt; erfasst, da dazu  
nach wie vor das Kriterium der Druckerpresse im Zentrum steht und als elektronische  
Medien prim&auml;r nur Radio und Fernsehen gelten.  Dass Zeitungen genauso per Internet statt  
auf Papier ver&ouml;ffentlicht werden, geht - wohl aus Unwissen - bei der Gesetzesredaktion  
regelm&auml;ssig vergessen, wie etwa j&uuml;ngst bei den Ausf&uuml;hrungen zur  
Mehrwertsteuerbeg&uuml;nstigung von Presseerzeugnissen. <P>
Eine weitere Knacknuss bedeutet die  
wachsende Zahl von Benutzern, die im Internet auf sogenannten Home Pages Informationen  
&uuml;ber sich selbst, oft mit Photo und pers&ouml;nlichen Informationen, ver&ouml;ffentlichen.  Die  
Motivation liegt im Reiz dieses neuen Kommunikationsmediums, mit Menschen aus aller  
Welt in Kontakt zu treten, mit ihnen Gedanken auszutauschen.  Was aber, wenn eine solche  
Person in ihrer Pers&ouml;nlichkeit verletzt wird?  Der Angreifer wird sich darauf berufen  
k&ouml;nnen, es handle sich um eine Person der &Ouml;ffentlichkeit - &uuml;ber die Home Page gebe sie  
Millionen Einblick in ihre Privatsph&auml;re.  Diese in den USA diskutierte Frage kann sich in der  
Schweiz beim zivilrechtlichen Pers&ouml;nlichkeitsschutz ebenso stellen.<P>
 
<H3>Wer ist verantwortlich?</H3><P>
 
Die strafrechtliche Verantwortlichkeit wirft in elektronischen Datennetzen andere  
Probleme auf, die an den Fall &lt;&lt;Rosenberg&gt;&gt; und die 156er Sex-Telefonangebote erinnern.  Ist  
der Betreiber etwa einer Computer-Mailbox f&uuml;r deren Inhalte straf- und zivilrechtlich  
verantwortlich?  Mit &lt;&lt;Mailbox&gt;&gt; ist im Fachjargon eine Art elektronischer Briefkasten und  
Marktplatz zu verstehen, realisiert &uuml;ber eine via Telefonnetz zug&auml;ngliche Computeranlage.   
Die Benutzer k&ouml;nnen dort pers&ouml;nliche und &ouml;ffentliche Daten deponieren und andere  
abholen.  Der bisher einzig bekannte schweizer Fall betrifft eine Mailbox in Z&uuml;rich, die vor  
einigen Monaten wegen Verdachts auf Handel mit unerlaubter Pornographie beschlagnahmt  
wurde.  Das System stand jedem, auch unter 16 j&auml;hrigen, offen.  Wer Daten (Programme,  
Bilder, Text) beziehen wollte, musste zuvor doppelt so viele herbringen.  Auf dem System  
lagerte der Inhalt von mehreren tausend Disketten und, wie sich ergab, auch unerlaubte  
Kinderpornographie, die ein Unbekannter dort deponiert hatte.<P>
Kann jedoch dem Betreiber  
des Systems vors&auml;tzliches Handeln angelastet werden, indem er die unerlaubte  
Pornographie &lt;&lt;in Kauf genommen&gt;&gt; haben soll?  Wohl kaum.  Bei den heutigen Datenmengen  
ist f&uuml;r die Betreiber eine &Uuml;berpr&uuml;fung aus praktischen Gr&uuml;nden ohne Zweifel unzumutbar.   
Jeder Mailbox- und Internet-Anbieter st&uuml;nde dauernd mit einem Bein im Gef&auml;ngnis, w&auml;re  
er f&uuml;r die auf seinem Rechner gespeicherten Daten pauschal verantwortlich.  Dabei sind  
viele der Daten ohnehin nur auf der &lt;&lt;Durchreise&gt;&gt; der Datenverkehr des Intemet basiert  
eben auf dem Prinzip, dass Daten von Rechner zu Rechner weitergereicht werden.  Und soll  
ein Mailbox-Betreiber private Post &uuml;berpr&uuml;fen d&uuml;rfen, bloss weil sie elektronisch vorliegt  
und nicht in einem Briefumschlag?<P>
 
<H3>Schabernack mit Hyperlinks</H3><P>
 
Damit nicht genug.  In einem beliebten Bereich des Intemet, dem graphischen &lt;&lt;World- 
Wide Web&gt;&gt;, kann jeder Anbieter auf seinen Informationsseiten mit elektronischen  
Querverweisen auf andere Angebote aufmerksam machen.  Wird ein solcher &lt;&lt;Hyperlink&gt;&gt;  
angew&auml;hlt, der aus einer elektronischen Adresse besteht, so ruft die Software des Benutzers  
in Sekundenschnelle jenes Angebot im Intemet auf.  Wie muss nun jemand strafrechtlich  
erfasst werden, der selbst zwar keine verbotenen Daten anbietet, aber &lt;&lt;Hyperlinks&gt;&gt; auf  
solche unterh&auml;lt?  Die F&auml;lle existieren.  So gibt es Personen, die im Internet kostenlos oder  
gegen Entgelt mehrseitige Listen mit Hyperlinks auf mitunter unerlaubtes pornographisches  
Material anbieten.  In der Schweiz machten sich diese Leute strafbar.  Als (Haupt-)T&auml;ter  
nicht mehr zu fassen w&auml;re jedoch derjenige, der statt auf  Pornos auf  Raubkopien von  
Computerprogrammen  verweisen wurde.  Er k&ouml;nnte als Anstifter oder  Gehilfe zur   
Urheberrechtsverletzung verurteilt werden; doch auch nur dann, wenn der  Internet- 
Benutzer selbst  &uuml;berhaupt bemerkt,  dass er  &uuml;ber den  Hyperlink unerlaubt auf ein  
Programm zugreift.<P>
Hyperlinks werfen weitere interessante Fragen auf.  So machte sich   
j&uuml;ngst ein Internet-Freak einen  Spass daraus, unter dem absch&auml;tzigen Titel  &lt;&lt;Babes  On   
The  Web&gt;&gt; Hyperlinks auf World Web-Angebote von Frauen zu publizieren, die er  f&uuml;r  
besonders sexy hielt.  Viele  f&uuml;hlten sich in ihrer Pers&ouml;nlichkeit angegriffen, konnten jedoch  
nicht gegen den Mann vorgehen.  Er bot  bloss die Links  zu ihren Angeboten an - und die  
waren ja prinzipiell jedermann zug&auml;nglich.<P>
 
<H3>Diffamierung via  &lt;&lt;offshore&gt;&gt;</H3><P>
 
Eines der  gr&ouml;ssten juristischen Probleme bleibt aber die Strafverfolgung selbst.  Sie  
scheitert im  Cyberspace oft an der fehlenden Gerichtsbarkeit.  Landesgrenzen und  
Distanzen sind in den internationalen  Datennetzen ohne Bedeutung.  Die Gerichte jedoch   
m&uuml;ssen sich an sie halten.  Wird ein  Internet-Angebot von einem Rechner im Ausland  
gestellt so kann gegen die T&auml;ter hierzulande meist nicht vorgegangen werden, falls die  
dortige Rechtsordnung nicht greift.  Zumindest der Erfolg der Tat  m&uuml;sste in der Schweiz  
eingetreten sein.  Wo aber tritt bei Computer-Gl&uuml;cksspielen, die immer zahlreicher &uuml;ber  
elektronische  Spielbanken im Intemet angeboten werden, der Erfolg ein?  Wohl kaum am  
Bildschirm des Schweizer Spielers.  Schon eher tut er dies auf der  Karibik-Insel, auf der  
sich der Rechner des elektronischen Kasinos befindet.  Damit aber w&auml;re das Angebot nicht  
zu unterbinden.  Der  Anbieter k&ouml;nnte sich zudem elegant um jede  Spielbankenabgabe   
dr&uuml;cken.  Dass die Steuerung und Wartung der Anlage wo m&ouml;glich von der Schweiz aus  
erfolgt, spielt dabei keine Rolle. &Uuml;ber solche ausl&auml;ndischen Rechner k&ouml;nnen  genausogut  
auch andere Dienste angeboten werden, die im eigenen Lande nie m&ouml;glich w&auml;ren.  Es sei  
dabei etwa auf die  Nazipropaganda verwiesen, die von amerikanischen  Rechner per   
Internet ungehindert in die ganze Welt verbreitet werden.  Dasselbe gilt  f&uuml;r  Pornographie,  
die in der Schweiz verboten sein mag, im betreffenden Ausland wom&ouml;glich nicht.  Solche   
&lt;&lt;Offshore&gt;&gt;-Systeme werden im  Intemet inzwischen  f&uuml;r gezielte  Diffamierungskampgnen  
eingesetzt.  So  k&uuml;ndigten zwei  Gruppierungen, die sich dem Schutz der Privatsph&auml;re  
verschrieben haben,  j&uuml;ngst an, Anbieter von Abh&ouml;rger&auml;ten im Internet blosszustellen.  Das  
Material soll  &uuml;ber einen  Internet-Rechner in einem &lt;&lt;sicheren&gt;&gt; Land angeboten werden,  
um  allf&auml;lligen Klagen gleich von vornherein den Wind aus den Segeln zu nehmen.<P>
Bisher  
funktionierten solche Taktiken.  Das  muss nicht immer so sein, wie ein Fall aus dem  
amerikanischen  &lt;&lt;Bible Belt &gt;&gt; zeigt.  Ein Ehepaar hatte in  Kalifornien  &uuml;ber eine  Mailbox   
pornographisches  Bildmaterial  f&uuml;r Erwachsene angeboten.  Nach  kalifornischer Praxis  
w&auml;ren die beiden nicht zu fassen gewesen.  Doch der  Prozess wurde den beiden im   
sittenstrengen  Tennessee gemacht, wo sie denn auch Ende des letzten Jahres von einem  
Gericht in  Memphis zu zweieinhalb und drei Jahren und einem Monat Zuchthaus verurteilt  
wurden.  Die  Begr&uuml;ndung lautete, auch in  Tennessee habe man auf die  kalifomische   
Mailbox zugreifen k&ouml;nnen.  Somit k&auml;men dortiges Recht und die dortigen   
Sittenvorstellungen zur Anwendung.<P>
Eine konsequente Umsetzung dieser Auffassung  w&uuml;rde  
freilich die geltenden  Zustaendigkeitsbestimmungen der Gerichte aus den Angeln heben.   
Doch auch andere  Regelbereiche sind den M&ouml;glichkeiten der elektronischen   
Datenkommunikation nicht mehr gewachsen.  Im  Bankwesen etwa: Schon bald werden  
Banken ihre  Finanzdienste per  Intemet direkt von den  Cayman Inseln aus in der Schweiz  
anbieten k&ouml;nnen - und dabei ungeschoren alle hiesigen  Bankenvorschriften unterlaufen  
k&ouml;nnen.<P>
 
Aus der NZZ vom 6. Oktober 1996 von David  Rosenthall<P>
<P>
<H3> Konzessionspflicht f&uuml;r Internet-Anbieter geplant</H3> 
dr.  Im vergangenen Fr&uuml;hling sorgte die Meldung f&uuml;r Schlagzeilen, dass via Intemet  
nun auch telefoniert werden k&ouml;nnte.  Eine Software hatte es m&ouml;glich gemacht, Sprache &uuml;ber  
das weltweite Datennetz zwischen zwei Partnern zu &uuml;bertragen.  Funktionierte dies  
zun&auml;chst nur wechselseitig, so hat sich die Qualit&auml;t des Verfahrens inzwischen betr&auml;chtlich  
gesteigert.  Es hat sich bisher aber nicht als ernsthafte Konkurrenz zu den Telefondiensten  
der Telefongesellschaften erwiesen.  Aus diesem Grund besch&auml;ftigte sich auch das Bundesamt  
f&uuml;r Kommunikation nicht weiter mit der Angelegenheit. Doch zweifellos unterlaufen solche  
Auspr&auml;gungen des Internet in ihrem Wesen die geltende Fernmeldeordnung und werden es  
mit fortschreitender technischer Entwicklung verst&auml;rkt tun.Der Vernehmlassungsentwurf  
des neuen Fernmeldegesetzes (FMG) unterstellt denn auch neu die Anbieter von Zug&auml;ngen  
zum Intemet der Konzessionspflicht Dies zieht wiederum eine Reihe von Folgen nach sich.   
So muss ein Konzession&auml;r die Gew&auml;hr bieten k&ouml;nnen, dass er das anwendbare Recht einh&auml;lt.   
Wof&uuml;r ein Internet-Anbieter verantwortlich ist, ist jedoch ungekl&auml;rt.  Fragen werfen etwa  
auch die verlangten Geheimhaltungs- und Pers&ouml;nlichkeitsschutzpflichten auf. Es ist im  
Internet zum Beispiel auf Grund seiner Konstruktion meist nicht m&ouml;glich, eine  
&lt;&lt;Anruferidentifizierung&gt;&gt; zu unterdr&uuml;cken.  Dabei kann der Gesetzgeber auf die  
verwendeten Verfahren keinen Einfluss nehmen.  Und nat&uuml;rlich werden Internet-Anbieter  
neu Konzessions- und Verwaltungsgeb&uuml;hren entrichten m&uuml;ssen und sich so an der  
Finanzierung der Grundversorgung beteiligen.<P>

Summary:
</B>
<P>
Environmental considerations and the associated demand for pollution 
control have become an important issue in the design of almost all 
combustion machines. For direct injection diesel engines the formation 
of pollutants  like soot, nitric oxides and unburned hydrocarbons are 
determined by the nature of the fuel spray. Computational Reactive 
Fluid Dynamics (CRFD) is a powerful and flexible tool for the 
investigation of the fundamental processes which govern the spray and 
combustion phenomena in reciprocating engines.
<P>
The objective of this project is the closer coordination of the 
research efforts between universities and industries through 
complementary developments, exchange of know-how and the transfer of 
technologies. In particular, the integration of CRFD codes in the 
design process of engines plays an important part in this common 
effort, which in turn requires the improvement of the present models 
and the development of new computational methods and techniques.

Summary:
</B>
<P>
Natural gas fuelled combustion engines have the potential to combine low exhaust gas emissions with high power output and good efficiency. In order to meet future stringent emission standards however, further research and development work for gas engines has to be done. Especially the increasing utilisation of gas-fired co-generation has highlighted a keen demand for detailed investigation of the emission level and of the performance of gas engines.
<P>
With regard to lowest exhaust gas emission levels (especially NOx), premixed combustion of gaseous fuels (lean-burn or stoechiometric operation with a three-way-catalyst) is very promising. In close collaboration with engine-manufacturers, research work is carried out at the I. C. Engines and Combustion Laboratory at ETH, in order to investigate several concepts for premixed combustion of gaseous fuels (lean-burn, stoechiometric operation with exhaust gas recirculation) in terms of emissions, power output and efficiency.

Summary:
</B>
<P>
Combustion in I.C. engines is driven by the complex interaction between fluid mechanics and reaction kinetics. Thus, understanding the evolution of the turbulent flow field prior to combustion is of crucial importance for proper engine design with respect  to thermal efficiency and pollutant formation.
<P>
This research project uses a 3-D fiberoptic LDV system. Investigations carried out under cold flow conditions with a flat piston and a pancake combustion chamber provided information about the mean flow, the turbulence intensities, the integral time scales and the integral length scales of the turbulence field derived by using the Taylor Hypothesis at various locations in the cylinder, at various engine speeds and using different inlet channel configurations in  order to generate different swirl patterns during the intake stroke. Of particular interest are in this context the Reynolds-stresses derived from 3-D simultaneous measurements, the flow field during flame kernel development and in the long term turbulence enhancement during the last stages of combustion.

<TITLE>Holographic Temperature Measurement within the Thermal Boundary Layer </TITLE>

Summary:
<P>

</B>
Heat transfer measurements in internal combustion engines are complex due to the non-steady pressure gradients, turbulence parameters and reaction zones. In steadystate conditions the physical mechanisms of heat transfer at the interface between the hot gas and the wall are basically the same as in dynamic considerations. For engines, variables of interest include surface  heat transfer, boundary layer temperature distribution and boundary layer thickness. In heat transfer experiments the objective among them is to determine the temperature distribution throughout a gas or fluid. Since the laminar sublayer thickness can be in the regime of micrometers, an appropriate high-resolution measurement technique is considered.
<P>
The experimental approach within this project relies on known physical foundations where functional relations depend in e.g. thermal refractive index change of the gas or terms of the scattering mechanism for phonon heat conduction. For quantitative determination of temperature profiles in the boundary layer, heterodyne holographic interferometry, a special opto-electronic measurement technique, has been introduced. The basic idea is to introduce a small frequency shift between the optical frequencies of the two interfering light fields. This results in an intensity modulation of the two light fields for any given point in the interference pattern. With this technique the interference phase can be measured with an accuracy of +/- 0.3% at any point in the fringe pattern corresponding to an interpolation of better than 1/1000 of one fringe with a high spatial resolution.

Summary:
</B>
<P>
The ETH flywheel hybrid power train is a project, to explore the potential of ultimate fuel economy of power trains assigned to passenger cars. The project has been launched in spring 1990. All the major simulations have been completed and the individual components of the power train have been submitted to excessive testing. The different test results show, that the major goals of the project can be achieved.
<P>
<B>
Concept:
</B>
<P>
This concept of the parallel hybrid power train shown in Fig.1 contains some features which are specifically designed or adapted for the project's purpose; among them a combustion engine (SI engine, 1.3l, 50 kW), an electric motor, a flywheel and a continuously variable transmission with a very high gear ratio (i2 - CVT).
<P>
The vehicle is supposed to be powered by the flywheel when operating at moderate speed (up to 10 kW power demand). If the flywheel's capacity falls short of the tolerated minimum level, it will be recharged by the SI engine at open throttle. The engine will be cut off after the flywheel has reached the proper frequency. This operating mode is called "Duty Cycle Operation" (DCO). There is the possibility to store a considerable amount of braking energy into the flywheel during decelerations. The power train is switched from flywheel power to direct engine power at higher speeds, while the i2 - CVT is running the engine at its highest possible efficiency.
<P>
The power train includes an additional specially designed electric motor (6 kW) to give the vehicle a possibility of a short driving range (20 km) by zero tail - pipe emissions. This motor is also able to provide engine starting- and alternator- duties. Despite of the motor's modest performance and the additional weight of the concept, there is sufficient power available since the flywheel can be used to cover the peak power needs of the electric motor.
<P>
The individual test trials of the different components have shown a considerable fuel economic potential of up to 40% at part load. The power train has been submitted to dynamic trials in July 1996 with good results concerning fuel consumption and emissions at ECE-Cycles.

Summary:
</B>
<P>
The knowledge of the main chemical reactions and the physical conditions associated with the process offers the opportunity for developing theoretical models of combustion phenomena. The success of this modelling is dependent on the possibility of accurate measurements of a number of combustion species in various environments. The objective is to develop a method of studying flame fronts in engines under homogeneous charge conditions and the study of turbulence effects on the combustion process. The general principle of flame front detection is based on the visualization of a species which is strongly affected by the flame. This can be achieved by adding small quantities of tracer molecules which are excited by laser light. Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) imaging techniques will be used to map species concentrations. In addition Mie and Raman scattering will be employed to obtain the time-resolved flame structure.
<P>
A spectral approach for modelling flame front-turbulence interactions runs in parallel with the experiments.

<HR WIDTH=100%  ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=3>
<B>Summary:
</B>
<P>
Modern electronic engine control systems provide a great deal of control parameters in order to meet both the emissions standards at a reasonable fuel consumption and the necessity of good overall operation at all possible engine conditions. In a former project (Hybrid IIB) optimizations were done on a DI diesel engine with an Electronic Common Rail injection system (ECR) and controlled Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). However, more detailed information of the fuel/air-distribution and the precise structure  of fuel sprays is required.
<P>
In order to investigate and optimize the injection process a new
non-instrusive, optical diagnostic tool is being developed. The envisaged technique is capable to determine the structure of high velocity dense fuel sprays in engines, operating at practical  conditions. In this context injection related values like spray propagation, droplet size and droplet density distribution will be examined. First experiments were done to determine the visibility of the spray and the combustion as a function of the overall operation time, and the engine operating state. The results show no serious restriction of the optical access to the combustion chamber due to soot deposition on the sapphire window at the measured operating states.

ABSTRACT
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
This paper describes an investigation of implementing variable valve timing with the use of a secondary valve in the intake tract. The secondary valve acts in series with the conventional poppet valve of the engine, which is actuated in the conventional manner and with fixed timing. It is significantly easier to adjust the timing of the secondary valve than that of the main valve. There are two possible modes of operation of this device. One is to control valve overlap, improving low speed low load performance. The other is to use it as a load control mechanism, replacing the conventional throttle and therefore reducing the 'pumping losses' associated with conventional throttling. We have implemented such a system on a motored single-cylinder research engine using pneumatic actuation. Our experiments have demonstrated successful load control, significant pumping loss reduction, and control of backflow from the exhaust to the intake manifold.

INTRODUCTION
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
Conventional automotive engines suffer from the drawback that the timing of the intake event is invariant with engine speed and load. It has long been known that improvements in gasoline engine performance would be obtainable if the valve timing were variable so that it could be optimised for any combination of load and speed in the engine's operating range. A great deal of work is currently under way on schemes for variable valve timing (VVT), some of which are starting to come to market. It remains true, however, that the difficulties of providing a variable valve timing mechanism with acceptable performance, cost and reliability for general usage have yet to be satisfactorily solved.<P>
This paper describes an investigation of a method of implementing VVT with the use of a secondary valve in the intake tract. The principle is that the secondary valve acts in series with the conventional poppet valve of the engine, which is actuated in the conventional manner and with fixed timing. The secondary valve is not required to withstand the temperatures and pressures of combustion, and therefore can be of relatively lightweight design. It is therefore significantly easier to adjust the timing of the secondary valve than that of the main valve.<P>
There are two possible modes of operation of this device. One is to use it as a load control mechanism, replacing the conventional throttle and therefore reducing the 'pumping losses' associated with conventional throttling.The other is to control valve overlap, improving low speed low load (idling) performance. In the load control mode, the secondary valve closes early in the intake stroke of the engine, limiting the flow of air and fuel into the cylinder. The timing of the valve closure governs the load of the engine. In this manner some losses resulting from the irreversible nature of flow past a throttle plate are avoided, and a fuel economy benefit should accrue. This is very similar to load control by use of early intake valve closure. In the overlap control mode, the secondary valve remains closed as the main valve opens, preventing the 'backflow' of air and exhaust residual from the exhaust to the inlet port that can deteriorate engine performance at idle. The secondary valve opens once the exhaust valve has been effectively closed. This of course allows the main valve timings to be set to a high degree of overlap, resulting in higher possible torque and power at high load high speed operating points (at which the secondary valve would be permanently open).<P>
The purpose of this study was not to develop actuators and algorithms suitable for deployment on a prototype or production vehicle, but to investigate in a laboratory what magnitude of benefits could be expected from such a deployment. We have implemented such a secondary valve and tested its performance on a motored single cylinder research engine. We wish to emphasise that we have made no effort yet to develop an actuator suitable for in-car use, and also that we have made no effort to develop an energy-efficient actuator: these tasks will be considered if it becomes clear that doing so is worthwhile.

DISCUSSION
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

We have implemented an actuator able to test the secondary valve concept. This actuator is able to open or close the intake port upstream of the poppet valve in a few milliseconds. With this actuator we were able to use the secondary valve concept to demonstrate the main identified benefits of variable valve timing: throttleless load control, with accompanying savings of pumping work, and backflow control at low loads (the latter obtained with extreme valve timings). The results obtained are in line with the predictions made on the basis of theoretical work: i.e., fuel savings at part load of around 5% and at idle of about 15% (the idle figure being based purely on analytical work alone). These predictions, along with the expected benefits of the backflow control possibilities, await validation on a firing engine.<P>
It is worth noting that when a secondary valve is used to regulate the engine load it becomes possible to vary the engine load from one cycle to the next -- indeed, in a multicylinder engine, from one cylinder firing to the next. This might have considerable value in enabling better control of an engine in transient conditions, as well as in controlling cylinder to cylinder variations in torque, air-fuel ratio, etc.<P>
The next stage of our study will be to implement the secondary valve concept on a production engine. We currently intend to implement a very similar actuator to that described in this paper on such an engine. This device has proved itself to be remarkably robust, reliable and repeatable. If the benefits deduced from the experiments described in this paper are indeed demonstrated on a production engine, the next task would be to investigate practical implementations of this concept for automotive application.

Summary:
</B>

<P>
The modeling of combustion and pollutant formation in an internal combustion engine is a challenging task, involving turbulence, transfer processes, spray penetration, chemical kinetics and flame propagation, as well as numerical methods. The level and structure of turbulence in the flow field immediately prior to and shortly after ignition strongly affects combustion and flame propagation. Engine turbulence (both in experiments and computations) is usually characterized for the flow field without combustion (&quot;cold-flow studies&quot;). In the present project we study turbulence parameters in reciprocating engine flows, using numerical solution of the governing  differential equations of compressible flow and appropriate turbulence modeling. The solution is based on the EPISO algorithm and the use of the KIVA-II code. The simulations complement LDA measurements, performed in our Laboratory. Our results for flat and bowl-in-piston geometries yield interesting insights into the characteristics of the turbulent flow field and are in good agreement with experiments. Next steps will involve modeling of flame propagation during premixed combustion and of heat release rate during diffusion combustion.

Summary:
</B>
<P>
Calculations show that the carbon-dioxide output per energy unit of an
electric vehicle whose batteries are charged in the European grid is larger
than the output of a small and part-load optimized SI-engine. This
observation is the starting point for a multi-disciplinary project, whose
goal is to realize such a propulsion system especially well suited for
light vehicles. Based on the experiences of earlier projects the
keycomponents of such a device are now identified, i.e. part-load
optimization (EGR, valve-control, charged and small engine, etc.), friction
reduction (motor state-dependent coolant temperature, etc.),  heat storage
for reduction of the engine warm-up time, flexible and controllable
drive-trains (CVT, etc.),  storage of the kinetic energy  instead of
dissipation during decceleration (recuperation), engine deactivation
instead of idling and automatic reactivation, careful heat-management and
enhanced exhaust-gas treatment.
<P>
Special emphasis is laid on the modelling and a priori optimization of the
entire propulsion system using mathematical models of all components.

<B>Summary:
</B>
<P>
Exhaust gas recirculation is a well established method to reduce NOx-emissions of diesel engines. The trade-off existing between NOx and fuel consumption leads to the fact that, in industrial practice, only limited recirculation rates are interesting. Thus, the target is to establish a method for reducing NOx without degradation of engine performance, especially fuel consumption.
<P>
The combination of exhaust gas recirculation with the Miller system and a flexible injection system is the most promising way to reach the goal of nitric oxide emission reduction without degradation in engine performance and efficiency.
<P>
The Miller system allows for operation at higher charging pressures by closing the inlet valve before BDC. The cylinder charge at BDC has thus for the same pressure higher density and lower temperature. This leads to generally lower temperatures during the complete process and by that to a further reduction of NOx-emissions as could be shown in the experiments, where reductions in brake specific nitric oxide emissions of up to 20% have been observed. At the same time, fuel consumption decreased in the order of 0.5 - 2%.
<P>
This improvement in fuel consumption can now be used to partially compensate for the losses associated with high recirculation rates when combining the Miller system with EGR to further reduce NOx. Measurements with recirculation rates of up to 13% yielded NOx- reductions of 35 to 60% while fuel consumption increased between 1 and 5%, respectively.
<P>
The additional application of a common rail injection system is expected to even  further improve engine efficiency and emissions.
<P>
In parallel to the experimental investigations models describing the formation and destruction of NOx in D.I. diesel engines are developed. A quasi-dimensional model with detailed chemistry serves as an instrument for the evaluation of potentials. Starting from detailed mechanisms reduced kinetic models are derived for the implementation into a CFD-code to enable the transfer of experimental results to other engine configurations and geometries.

<B>Summary:
</B>
<P>
Laser light scatter transmission methods of Mie's theory have been used to study the behavior of soot particles in diffusion flames. These methods have made it possible to measure with some accuracy the diameter, number and density of soot particles in steady and non-steady flames. However, the determination of the soot particle diameter depends on the complex refractive index. A soot particle is an absorptive substance, its chemical composition is variable, and its optical constant differs according to the temperature. It is very difficult to determine accurately the complex refractive index (the optical constant) and the surface temperature of a soot particle. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to develop and establish a method of simultaneously measuring the diameter of soot  particles and their surface temperature and refractive index in a non-contact way using some means which can enhance the time and space resolution in flames. This study has established methods for measuring all of them. It is based on multiple pieces of in formation obtained from the combined use of an 
opto-acoustic deflection technique and of the light scatter and transmission methods. The surface temperature measurement technique has been tested in an actual flame and has been compared with a holographic method.

<P>
Realistic physical and computational models of the
atomization and penetration of high speed liquid fuel jets are
required if the fuel/air mixing processes in many combustors are
to be understood. This will lead to the formulation of effective
design criteria for optimizing the performance of the fuel injection
equipment and combustion system. 
<P>
This investigation into the fundamental processes
governing liquid atomization applies Phase Doppler Anemometry
to study a high pressure transient Diesel fuel spray injected
into a high pressure, high temperature combustion cell. This combustion
cell provides a flexible facility to study sprays over a wide
range of environments, including conditions found in Diesel engine
combustion chambers. 
<P>
The applied measurement technique, Phase Doppler
Anemometry (PDA), measures simultaneously the velocity and size
of individual droplets passing through a small measurement volume.
Scanning the measurement volume over a grid of measurement points
in the spray allows a visualization of the dynamic planar droplet
flow field structure to be presented in terms of the time varying
droplet trajectories, velocities and sizes.

Computational Investigations of Flow,  Spray and Combustion Processes in Diesel Engines

</FONT>
<P><HR WIDTH=100%  ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=3><P><B>Summary:</B><P>


The performance of Diesel engines is influenced by the quality of the 
fuel sprays, which in turn determine the combustion process and the 
associated formation of  pollutants. The main objective of this 
project is the computational investigation of the fundamental 
mechanisms which govern the spray formation and the chemical 
reactions, with the intent to establish a reliable, predictive tool to 
be used in the design process of IC-engines. The development and use 
of computational models demands extensive verification procedures 
which involve stability analyses with respect to inital and boundary 
conditions, as well as the exploration of the range of applicability. 
An essential contribution towards these validations
are the experimental data obtained in our laboratory by means of the 
constant-volume, high-pressure and high-temperature combustion cell.

<P> 

The backbone of the simulations is Kiva-3, a computer code which 
solves the three-dimensional conservation equations for mass, species, 
momentum  and energy in combination with the k-epsilon turbulence model. The 
sprays are described by a stochastic evolution law which considers 
droplet collisions, evaporation, turbulent droplet-gas interactions 
and droplet breakups.  Several chemical reaction models of various 
degree of sophistication are available to study the combustion 
processes.

Summary:
</B>
<P>
Detailed reaction  mechanisms are usually too complex to be used in full simulations of combustion phenomena (i.e. including both hydrodynamic and chemical effects), since they dramatically increase the computational time by introducing a large number of chemical time scales  (and therefore stiffness). Simplified reaction schemes, that are capable of reproducing the chemical properties of the reacting system, offer a viable alternative.
<P>
The conventional method of obtaining a reduced mechanism, based on the educated use of steady state and partial equilibrium approximations, relies heavily on intuition and experience on the particular system. Furthermore, the optained reduced scheme is usually not only specific to the problem under consideration, but also depends strongly on the  initial conditions considered.
<P>
Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) provides a systematic, automated way and a programmable algorithm to identify fast reactions and steady-state species, find exhausted reaction rates and derive simplified kinetic schemes. CSP data, obtained during the analysis, provide physical insight and understanding of the mechanism under consideration. They can also be used to asses sensitivity of solutions with respect to input rate coefficients, and offer an alternative to the  conventional method of sensitivity analysis.

<B>Summary:
</B>
<P>
In the past two decades there has been significant progress in our understanding of transition to turbulence, especially in simple geometry flows, such as plane channel flows, open shear flows and boundary layers. Recent advances in high-order numerical methods and computers make the use of Direct Numerical Simulation feasible for complex geometry flows. In this project we focus on separated flows in channels with sudden expansions (backward-facing step, symmetric sudden expansion). In particular,
 two-dimensional simulations are performed using a Spectral-Element method, while the three-dimensional simulations are based on a
Spectral-Element/Fourier method. Systematic studies of classification of instabilities and transition to turbulence are performed. Computational results are in good agreement with experimental data.

Computational Investigation of Unsteady Heat Flux Through an I. C. Engine Cylinder Wall including Soot Layer Dynamics

</FONT><P><HR WIDTH=100%  ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=3><P><B>Summary:</B><P>

Heat transfer between fluid and combustion chamber wall is of importance and relevance to i. c. engines performance, thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions. This is particularly true with regard to low-heat-rejection engine concepts. There is an unresolved fundamental issue, as to what are the mechanisms of repeatedly observed enhancement of the apparent heat transfer coefficient, if reduced cooling and/or low-conductivity wall materials are used. Among several theories proposed, flame-wall interactions within the boundary layer and soot layer deposition and the oxidation have drawn particular attention during the last years.

<P>

This project deals with the influence of a wall soot layer of varying thickness on the unsteady heat transfer between the fluid and the engine cylinder wall during a full cycle of a four-stroke-engine operation. For that purpose a computational investigation has been carried out, using a 1-D model of a multi-layer solid wall for simulating the transient response within the confinement of the combustion chamber. The soot layer is thereby of varying thickness over time, depending on the relative rates of deposition and oxidation. The deposition rate is controlled mainly by thermophoretic effects, while the soot oxidation rate is obtained by means of an Arrhenius type process as a function of temperature and oxygen content, in the free stream. The input heat flux from the gas side to the wall includes well-known formulations for both the convective and the radiation mechanisms; for the latter process a zero penetration depth within the soot layer (i.e. heat absorption only at the soot surface) is assumed. In addition, the heat release due to soot burning is described as a source term within the considered soot sub-layer.

<P>

Results of the computations obtained so far show that the substrate wall temperature has a significant effect on the soot layer dynamics and thus on the wall heat flux to the combustion chamber wall. On the other hand a certain sensitivity of the results to the soot oxidation rate parameters and to the deposition process itself has been demonstrated.

<P>
Future computational work will include the thermal behavior of the laminar gas layer, while an appropriate experiment has to be designed for validation of the simulation results.

<FONT SIZE=5>2. Wichtig: </FONT> Verliehene B&uuml;cher werden nicht als solche behandelt. Sie gelten als Bibliotheksbestandteil und werden als vorhanden angesehen.

<A HREF="http://troja.ethz.ch/Publik/Projects/Project_Example.html">Ihr k&ouml;nnt hier ein Beispiel einer Projektbeschreibung finden.</A>



 Einmal,
dass Ihr in dieser Musterseite seid, braucht Ihr  im Menu<B> View</B>, <B>Document
Source</B> anzuklicken. Damit habt Ihr die M&ouml;glichkeit, die Seite zu
&auml;ndern. Ihr braucht nur den Text in Klammern zu &auml;ndern (einfach,
oder???), danach das Dokument speichern und mir per Mail schicken, damit
ich das File auf unserem Server speichern kann.<BR>
<BR>
Wie Ihr vielleicht gesehen habt, haben wir eine neue Seite &uuml;ber unsere
Mitarbeiter. Jeder der m&ouml;chte, kann etwas &uuml;ber sich selbst schreiben
(z.B. an welchem Projekt er arbeitet, Publikationen oder &auml;hnliches).

<B>Positionsregelung f&uuml;r nichtholonome mobile Roboter<BR>
<BR>
<I>Abstract:</I></B> Am Istitut f&uuml;r Robotik der ETHZ wurde ein kinematischer
Postionsregler auf drei mobilen Robotern mit zwei verschiedenen Konfigurationen
realisiert. Die Trajektorien dieses Reglers sind glatt und weisen keine
Punkte auf, in denen der Roboter die Richtung &auml;ndert. Mit Via-Punkten
ist die Vorgabe von Trajektorien m&ouml;glich. Simulation und Messung stimmen
gut &uuml;berein. Der Beweis der globalen asymptotischen Stabilit&auml;t
ist m&ouml;glich.<BR>

<B>Black Box Identification and Predictive Control of High Speed Machine
Tools<BR>
<BR>
<I>Abstract:</I></B> High speed machine tooling allows to increase productivity
and product quality, but presents new challenges for the control system.
To meet them, this paper proposes to review the conventional control structure,
restating the control problem in terms of a constrained finite horizon optimization
problem, which can be solved efficiently with a MPC-QDMC algorithm. This
approach is shown to allow to enhance significantly the precision attainable
with a fixed actuator choice. The model necessary for MPC is determined
at best using a black box model identification.<BR>

<B>Modeling and Robust Control of Active Noise Control Systems<BR>
<BR>
<I>Abstract:</I></B> Due to advances in digital electronics technology,
active noise control (ANC) systems can be implemented to eliminate noise
in a physical system, thus providing an alternative to strictly passive
control methods. Two approaches to active noise control are robust and adaptive.
In the work presented here, the robust control approach is applied to the
design of a fixed linear controller for eliminating noise in a duct. The
nominal model as well as the uncertainty description are derived by means
of identification. A controller is designed, analyzed and tested in experiments.<BR>

Es gibt verschieden Gr&uuml;nde, diese Seite zu betreiben. Eine davon ist, mit m&ouml;glichst wenig Aufwand kleinere Software oder auch Info's zur Verf&uuml;gung zu stellen. Die Info's sind allen zug&auml;nglich, nicht so die Software: Der FTP-Server ist nur mit einem Passwort erreichbar. (LVV Mitarbeiter sollten diese via E-mail erhalten).

<P>
<BLINK>Lest die README Files <B>bevor</B> etwas installiert wird!</BLINK>
<P>

Da alle Mac's miteinander vernetzt sind, ist der Verlust von Daten wegen eines Virus nicht zu untersch&auml;tzen. Deshalb muss jeder Macintosh im Netz abgesichert sein. Die neue Version der Antivirus Software ist <B>4.0.8</B>. Die neuen Definitionen (=Virus-Info's f&uuml;r die Software) sollten unbedingt mit installiert werden.

Der Update wird mit dem Patcher gemacht.

Patcher: SAM_4.0.8_Patcher.sea

Er sollte eigentlich alle Versionen ab 4.0 updaten, leider klappte dies bei mir nicht. Deshalb musste ich die Version 4.0.7 installieren und dann updaten. Mit dem Update werden auch die neuseten Definitionen geladen, weshalb sie nicht ben&ouml;tigt werden.

Es ist Sinnvoll an einem Tag der Woche den ganzen Mac nach Viren abzusuchen. SAM &uuml;bernimmt diese Aufgabe automatisch, falls der "Scheduler" konfiguriert wurde. Im SAM, Untermenu TOOLS, Scheduler w&auml;hlen.
<P>
<DL>
Einstellungen
<P>
<DD>Event Type: Scan all local disk
<DD>When: at shutdown
<DD>How Often: weekly

<P> 
Am Freitag nach Viren abzusuchen ist ungeschickt da, falls Viren gefunden werden, der Computer bis Montag eingeschaltet bleibt.

<p>Tourism is one of Australia's fastest growing and economically 
important industries.<P>

<H2><A NAME="xtocid187401">Export earnings</A></H2>

<UL>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/icons/dots/blueball.gif">In 1995-96 tourism 
generated export earnings of $14.1 billion, representing an increase of 16 per cent on 1994-95. <BR>

<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/icons/dots/blueball.gif">Tourism export earnings accounted for 12.8 per cent of Australia's total export earnings and 63.1 per cent of services exports, compared with 12.6 per cent and 61.2 per cent respectively in 1994-95.<BR>

<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/icons/dots/blueball.gif">By the year 2000, gross 
export earnings from tourism are estimated to rise to around $21 
billion.  By 2005 they are forcast to be $31 billion.<P>
</UL>

 <H2><A NAME="xtocid187402">Employment </A></H2>
<UL>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/icons/dots/blueball.gif">

The tourism industry accounts for around 6.9 per cent of Australia's workforce.  In 1993-94, 
tourism directly employed about 535,600 people.

<BR>

<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/icons/dots/blueball.gif">In the 10 years to 2003 the tourism industry is expected to generate directly around 160 000 new jobs. Two out of every three of these jobs are expected to be attributable to 
international tourism.<P>
</UL>

 <H2><A NAME="xtocid187403">Visitor numbers </A></H2>
<UL>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/icons/dots/blueball.gif">
Nearly 2 million people visited Australia in the first six months of 1996 - an increase of 14 per cent over the same period last year. More than  3.7 million international visitors came in 1995, and in the year 2000, some 
6.3 million people are expected.<BR>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/icons/dots/blueball.gif">Domestic tourism  
accounts for about 75 per cent of total tourism expenditure.  In 1995,  residents aged 14 and over undertook 59.7 million 
trips of at least one night's duration, spending a total of  251.8 million nights away from home.<p>
</UL>

 <H2><A NAME="xtocid187404">Major markets </A></H2>
<UL>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/icons/dots/blueball.gif">Japan, Southeast Asia and 
 New Zealand are currently Australia's three largest tourism 
markets.  In 1995, 782 700 Japanese (720 100 in 1994) ,  566 000 people from South East Asia (487 800 in 1994) and 538 400 New Zealanders (480 400 in 1994) visited Australia.<BR>
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/icons/dots/blueball.gif">While Japan is expected 
to remain our single largest market, tourism from other Asian countries 
is becoming increasingly important.  Tourists from Asian countries other 
than Japan accounted for 28.5 per cent of all visitors in 1995 (26.3 per cent in 1994).<P>

<H1>Help for Broker Queries</H1>
<HR>
<P>
The 
<a href="http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/">Harvest</a> 
Broker handles many types of queries.  The simplest query is
a single keyword, such as:
<pre>
	lightbulb
</pre>
Searching for common words (like "computer" or "html") may take a lot of
time.  Please be considerate of other users.
<P>
Particularly for large Brokers, it is often helpful to use more powerful
queries.  Harvest supports many different index/search engines, with
varying capabilities.  At present, our most powerful (and commonly used)
search engine is <a href="http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu:1994/">Glimpse</a>,
which supports:
<UL>
<LI> case-insensitive and case-sensitive queries;

<LI> the ability to match parts of words, whole words, or multiple word
phrases (like "resource discovery");

<LI> Boolean (AND/OR) combinations of keywords;

<LI> approximate matches (e.g., allowing spelling errors);

<LI> structured queries (which allow you to constrain matches to certain
fields);

<LI> the ability to show matched lines or entire matching records (e.g.,
for citations);

<LI> the ability to specify limits on the number of matches returned; and

<LI> a limited form of regular expressions (e.g., allowing "wild card"
expressions that match all words ending in a particular suffix).

</UL>
The different types of queries (and how to use them) are discussed below.
Note that you use the same syntax regardless of what index/search engine is
running in a particular Broker, but that not all engines support all of the
above features.  In particular, some of the Brokers use WAIS, which
sometimes searches faster than Glimpse but supports only Boolean keyword
queries and the ability to specify result set limits.

<p>
The different options -
case-sensitivity,
approximate matching,
the ability to show matched lines vs. entire matching records,
and the ability to specify match count limits -
can all be specified with buttons and menus in the Broker query forms.
<p>
A structured query has the form: 
<pre>
	tag-name : value
</pre>
<p>
where <i>tag-name</i> is a Content Summary attribute name, and <i>value</i>
is the search value within the attribute.  If you click on a Content
Summary, you will see what attributes are available for a particular
Broker.  A list of common attributes is shown 
<A HREF="#attrs">here</A>.
<p>
Keyword searches and structured queries can be combined using Boolean 
operators (AND and OR) to form complex queries.  Lacking parentheses, 
logical operation precedence is based left to right.
For multiple word phrases or regular expressions, you need to enclose the
string in double quotes, e.g.,
<pre>
	"internet resource discovery"
or
	"discov.*"
</pre>

<H2>Examples</H2>
Simple keyword search query: 
<pre>
	Arizona</pre>
This query will return all objects in the Broker containing 
the word <B>Arizona</B>.<p>
Boolean query: 
<pre>
	Arizona AND desert</pre>
This query will return all objects in the Broker that contain both words
anywhere in the object in any order.<p>

Phrase query: 
<pre>
	"Arizona desert"</pre>
This query will return all objects in the Broker that contain 
<B>Arizona desert</B> as a phrase.  Notice that you need to put
double quotes around the phrase.<p>

Boolean queries with phrases: 
<pre>
	"Arizona desert" AND windsurfing</pre>
Simple Structured query: 
<pre>
	Title : windsurfing</pre>
This query will return all objects in the Broker where the <b>Title</b>
attribute contains the value <b>windsurfing</b>. <p>

Complex query: 
<pre>
	"Arizona desert" AND (Title : windsurfing)</pre>
This query will return all objects in the Broker that contain the phrase 
<b>Arizona desert</b> and where 
the <b>Title</b> attribute of the same object 
contains the value <b>windsurfing</b>. <p>

<h2>Query options selected by menus or buttons</h2>
<p>These checkboxes allow some control of the query specification.

<dl>
<dt><b>Case insensitive:</b>
<dd>
By selecting this checkbox the query will become case insensitive (lower
case and upper case letters differ).  Otherwise, the query will be case
senstive.  The default is case insensitive.

<dt><b>Keywords match on word boundaries:</b>
<dd>
By selecting this checkbox, keywords will match on word boundaries.
Otherwise, a keyword will match part of a word (or phrase).  For example,
"network" will matching "networking", "sensitive" will match "insensitive",
and "Arizona desert" will match "Arizona desertness".  The default is to
match keywords on word boundaries.

<dt><b>Number of errors allowed:</b>
<dd>
Glimpse allows the search to contain a number of errors.  An error is
either a deletion, insertion, or substitution of a single character.
The Best Match option will find the match(es) with the least number of
errors.  The default is 0 (zero) errors.

<i>Note:</i> The previous three options do not apply to attribute names.
Attribute names are always case insensitive and allow no errors.
</dl>

<h2>Result set presentation</h2>
<p>These checkboxes allow some control of presentation of the query return.

<dl>
<dt><b>Display matched lines (from content summaries):</b>
<dd>
By selecting this checkbox, the result set presentation will contain the
lines of the Content Summary that matched the query.  Otherwise, the
matched lines will not be displayed.  The default is to display the matched
lines.

<dt><b>Display object descriptions (if available):</b>
<dd>
Some objects have short, one-line descriptions associated with them.  By
selecting this checkbox, the descriptions will be presented.  Otherwise,
the object descriptions will not be displayed.  The default is to display
object descriptions.

<dt><b>Verbose display:</b>
<dd>
This checkbox allows you to set whether results are displayed listing
the filename, host, path, and Content Summary each on separate lines, or
just with two lines listing the filename (without a label) and the
Content Summary (with a label).  The default is verbose.
</dl>


<H2>Regular Expressions</H2>
Some types of regular expressions are supported by Glimpse.
A regular expression search can be much slower that other searches.
The following is a partial list of possible patterns.
(For more details see the
<a href="http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu:1994/glimpse.html">Glimpse manual pages</a>.)
<ul>
<li> <kbd>^joe</kbd> will match "joe" at the beginning of a line.
<li> <kbd>joe$</kbd> will match "joe" at the end of a line.
<li> <kbd>[a-ho-z]</kbd> matches any character between a and h or 
between o and z.
<li> <kbd>.</kbd> matches any single character except newline.
<li> <kbd>c*</kbd> matches zero or more occurrences of the character "c"
<li> <kbd>.*</kbd> matches any number of wild cards
<li> <kbd>\*</kbd> matches the character "*"  (\ escapes any of the above
special characters).
</ul>

Regular expressions are currently limited to approximately 30 characters,
not including meta characters.  Regular expressions will generally not
cross word boundaries (because only words are stored in the index).  So,
for example, "lin.*ing" will find "linking" or "flinching," but not "linear
programming."

<H2><A NAME="attrs">List of Common Attribute Names</A></H2>
<p>
Each Broker can support different attributes, depending on the data it
holds.  Below we list a set of the most common attributes. Clicking on a
hypertext link below will provide a brief explanation about each.

<P>
<P>Australia offers a variety of accommodation establishments for budget 
travellers. This guide aims to help you choose accommodation that best 
meets your needs while providing an assurance that certain standards have 
been met by a particular property. 
<P>The Backpacker Accommodation Classification Scheme was introduced in 
1995 by the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) with funding provided 
by the Commonwealth Department of Tourism. The scheme provides an 
independent assessment of accommodation properties based on the voluntary 
participation of industry members. The majority of backpacker 
accommodation establishments in Australia are taking part in the scheme.
<P>Backpacker accommodation is defined for this purpose as properties 
offering, at low cost, a range of sleeping arrangements, including 
dormitories, with communal and self-catering facilities and an emphasis 
on guest interaction. Establishments were rated under guidelines that 
were cooperatively determined between the backpacker industry and the 
AAA. 
<P>This scheme is broadly similar to the 'star' rating schemes for hotels 
and motels, and is based on a rating system of one to five backpacks. One 
backpack denotes an establishment offering clean, simple and basic 
facilities, while at the other end of the scale, five backpacks indicates 
a superior standard of facilities. To qualify for inclusion in the 
scheme, properties must be clean and well maintained. Each establishment 
must also satisfy building, health, fire safety and local council 
regulations. 
<P>Ratings are based on a points system with points being allocated in 
two categories, vital and desirable, based on the guidelines. Vital 
points are critical in determining the one- to five-backpack rating and 
are awarded for those items properties should possess. These include 
minimum facilities in sleeping, bathroom, communal and kitchen areas as 
well as appropriate security features and information sources. Desirable 
points are awarded for many of the optional elements properties may offer 
for the benefit of guests including tour booking services, an extensive 
range of leisure facilities, and additional security and room features. 
<P>The requirements of lower classifications are automatically included 
in higher classifications.

Desirable: 120-140<BR>
Excellent quality of accommodation. 
<P>The information in this guide is not intended to provide comprehensive 
details about all of an establishment's facilities or to indicate 
anything about its atmosphere or ambience. Where additional facilities 
such as swimming pools and transportation are provided as part of an 
accommodation package, these have not been assessed under this ratings 
system. Other guidebooks provide more comprehensive information on these 
features. 
<P>We hope that this ratings guide will help you to make the right choice 
about the style of hostel accommodation you are looking for and will 
enhance the quality and enjoyment of your travels around Australia. Happy 
hostelling!<p>

Building up backpacking

A new national strategy will guide the future development of the growing 
backpacker market. (Photo courtesy
 of the YHA.)
</CITE><P>The backpacker market is one of the most important sectors of 
Australia's tourism industry - and it's growing fast.
<P>In 1994, 217 000 backpackers travelled to Australia and, if recent 
projections prove correct, that number will more
 than double by the turn of the century and treble by the year 2004.
<P>That spells good news for the economy, because despite their 
reputation as being travellers on a shoestring budget,
 backpackers actually stay three times as long as other visitors and 
spend twice as much.
<P>They also like to travel off the beaten track, which helps spread the 
benefits of tourism to regional and rural Australia.
<P>To ensure Australia realises the full potential of this important 
sector of the industry, the Federal Government will
 release a new strategy in early October to guide the development and 
marketing of backpacker tourism.
<P>The <I>National Backpacker Tourism Strategy </I>
provides a plan of action for industry and governments to meet the goal 
of:
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>establishing Australia as the preferred destination for 
independent budget travellers by offering distinctive, world-class 
backpacker experiences provided by a competitive and viable 
industry.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The diversity of experiences to be had here, not the least being our 
unique natural environment and cultural
 heritage, already provide Australia with a strong competitive edge in 
attracting this type of traveller.
<P>But we also have some hurdles to overcome, including distance from 
major source countries, cost and availability of
 transport, and a lack of awareness about the range of activities and 
places worth exploring.
<P>The fragmented and 'small business' nature of the backpacker industry 
can also be an impediment to its growth. In
 particular, individual operators find it difficult to get finance and 
training to improve their facilities and services, and
 they sometimes have to struggle with local governments and communities 
to overcome negative, outdated images
 of the backpacker as an itinerant, scruffy wanderer.
<P>The approach outlined in the strategy seeks to overcome these 
impediments, while building on the strengths of the
 industry. Under the themes of access, diversity, cooperation and 
professionalism, it proposes actions to tackle a range
 of key issues including:
<UL>
<LI>marketing
<LI>accommodation
<LI>research
<LI>transport
<LI>safety
<LI>industry coordination
<LI>visas
<LI>employment
<LI>training
<LI>community awareness.
</UL>
 <P>Funding will also be made available through the National Backpacker 
Program, administered by the Department of
 Tourism, to help establish the industry on a firmer footing so it can 
capture a greater share of the global backpacker
 market.
<P>The strategy was developed after extensive consultation with the 
tourism industry, State and Territory governments,
 and others with an interest in the issue. This process involved the 
formation of a Backpacker Consultative Forum,
 comprising industry and government representatives, which called for 
submissions to the strategy and identified
 the key issues to be addressed.
<P>

<H2>
Ratings released
</H2>


A new ratings guide for backpacker accommodation will also be released at 
the same time as the National
 Backpacker Strategy.
<P>The guide lists those establishments that have been assessed by the 
Australian Automobile Association (AAA) under a
 new voluntary backpacker accommodation ratings scheme, ranking them on a 
one to five 'backpack' system.
<P>A rating of one backpack indicates that the accommodation offers 
clean, simple and basic facilities, while a rating of
 five indicates a superior standard of facility. 
<P>The guide will help backpackers to make more informed choices about 
where they stay, provide a fair and
 independent guide to costs and standards of accommodation, and provide a 
marketing edge to those establishments
 that participate in the scheme.

Tourism the focus of investment mission
</H1>
<!-- Graphic Tag -->
<IMG WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=144 BORDER=1 hspace=10 ALT="Sunset" ALIGN=RIGHT 
SRC="sunset.GIF"><P>In recent years, Singaporeans have been astute 
investors of Australian hotel properties, recognising the opportunities
 that the strong growth of tourism in this country has offered.
<P>In August, a delegation of senior business people from Singapore and 
representatives from the Singapore Tourist
 Promotion Board (STPB) visited Australia on a 10-day 'tourism investment 
mission', reflecting the continued overseas
 investor confidence in the future of the Australian tourism industry.
<P>While past investment has tended to focus on existing hotels, this 
mission also looked at the potential for
 constructing new facilities in some of our key tourist destinations.
<P>Its itinerary, devised by the STPB, provided delegates with contrasts 
between the rainforest and reef of the tropical
 north to the red earth and spectacular sunsets of the west, taking in 
Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Cairns, Port Douglas,
 Darwin, Broome and Perth.
<P>The delegates were exposed to successful products and potential 
opportunities within both established and
 developing markets.
<P>The Department of Tourism also provided organisers and participants 
with extensive information on the Australian
 tourism industry and existing Singaporean investment in it.
<P>While impressed by the sheer size of the Australian continent and the 
range of opportunities it provides, the
 Singaporeans highlighted some of the associated barriers to be overcome, 
such as providing easy access to emerging
 destinations from international airports.
<P>From Australia's perspective, the timing of the investment mission is 
critical, given the combination of strong tourism
 growth (with international visitor numbers to Australia expected to 
double between now and the year 2000) and
 emerging shortages of accommodation in key destinations. 
<P>Annual occupancy rates across all standards of hotels and motels in 
Brisbane and Cairns are already approaching 80
 per cent, with the other destinations not far behind. During peak 
periods, supply is particularly short, especially in four
 and five star accommodation.
<P>The mission resulted from discussions in September 1994 between 
Australian Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, and
 Singaporean Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, during which the two 
leaders agreed to seek closer tourism ties
 between our countries.
<P>The delegation was accompanied initially by Singapore's Minister of 
State for Trade and Industry, and for
 Communications, Mr Goh Chee Wee, reflecting the depth of Singaporean 
commitment to the mission.<P>

</CITE><P>The March issue of <I>Talking Tourism</I> reported that a draft 
National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tourism
 Industry Strategy had been released for public comment. The strategy 
aims to increase the number of indigenous
 people employed in the tourism industry.
<P>The stategy was developed by the Tourism Industry Advisory Committee 
(TIAC), a body comprising representives
 from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), the 
Department of Tourism, other government
 agencies, tourism industry bodies, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander tourism operators. It aims to increase the
 number of indigenous people employed in the tourism industry.
<P><I>Talking Tourism</I> also reported that the ATSIC had called for 
applications for funding for pilot projects to test some of
 the key elements of the draft strategy. 
<P>Based on recommendations from TIAC, 12 projects have now been selected 
to receive grants totalling <NOBR>$690 850:</NOBR>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL>
<LI><B>Gringai Aboriginal Culture Tours</B> to establish cultural tours 
in the Hunter region.<P>

<LI><B>Ngurratjuta/Pmara Ntjarra</B> for a tourism unit to help existing 
and potential indigenous tourism enterprises in the Alice Springs area, 
and for interpretive material to promote the Aboriginal ownership of the 
Glen Helen Lodge and culture of the surrounding environment.<P>
<LI><B>NT Tourist Commission</B> for an awareness kit and visual aids to 
help indigenous people with potential tourism  projects, and for an 
indigenous tourism operators forum.<P>
<LI><B>Karijini Aboriginal Corporation</B> for quality publications and 
interpretive displays at the Karijini visitor centre, and to help Abstudy 
trainees attend a tourism training program.<P>
<LI><B>Kimberley Development Commission</B> for a product development

<LI><B>Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation</B> to develop an 
approach to the Queensland tourist industry for funds to increase 
indigenous employment in tourism, and for a tourist agent in North 
America to provide sales and marketing support for a selection of

Overseas vistors - all you need to know
</H1>
<P>If you want to know all there is to know about the characteristics and 
behaviour of overseas tourists to our country, all
 you have to do is pick up the <I>1994 International Visitor Survey 
(IVS)</I>, released recently by the Bureau of Tourism
 Research (BTR).
<P>At the flick of a page you can find out where the tourists came from, 
why they came, where they went, how they
 went, how long they stayed for, where they stayed, what they did and how 
much they spent.
<P>At a glance, the survey found that:
<UL>
<LI3 361 700 international visitors came to Australia in 1994, a 12 per 
cent increase on the 1993 figure.<P>


<LI>International visitors spent an average of $1886 while they were 
here, compared with $1787 in 1993.<P>


<LI>People from the United Kingdom and Ireland spent the most number of 
nights here (20 per cent of the total),
 followed by New Zealanders (10 per cent of the total).<P>


<LI>While the Japanese accounted for 22 per cent of all visitors aged 15 
plus, they only stayed an average of eight
 nights.<P>


<LI>Sydney's attractions, including shopping, the Opera House, Darling 
Harbour and The Rocks, continued to
 draw the most tourist interest. Sydney also was the most popular region 
visited, followed by the Gold Coast,
 Melbourne, Cairns, Brisbane and Perth.<P>


<LI>The large majority of international visitors to Australia during 1994 
were satisfied with tourist facilities
 (including airport facilities, hotel and restaurant service, and the 
availability of tourist information).<P>


<LI>On the downside, 22 per cent of visitors were dissatisfied with the 
times when shops were open, and 15 per
 cent with the cost of goods in shops.
</UL>
 <P>The IVS provides industry and government with a detailed insight into

Getting Bangs for your bucks

<IMG WIDTH=144 HEIGHT=222 hspace=10 BORDER=1 ALT="Tourist 
boat"ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="boat.GIF"><P>November will be an important month 
for ecotourism in Alice Springs this year, with a visit by two of the 
world's
 most successful and visionary ecotourism operators.
<P>Richard Bangs, a partner in Mountain Travel-Sobek, the world's largest 
adventure-travel company, and Stanley
 Selengut, feted as the travel industry's 'green guru', will be in town 
for a major forum on <I>
Innovative technology and design for tourism</I>. 
<P>The forum, to be held on 19 November, is being sponsored by the 
Federal Government under the National
 Ecotourism Program which is administered by the Department of Tourism. 
It will form part of a broader conference
 being run by the Ecotourism Association of Australia (EAA) from 18-23 
November.
<P>The forum will provide ecotourism operators with a wealth of 
information on how they can contribute to the
 sustainability of the industry by using energy and waste minimisation 
techniques, and environmentally friendly
 design. It will also give a round-up of the latest in information 
technology, and enable operators to share
 information, marketing initiatives and new ideas.
<P>New ideas are something that Richard Bangs is never short of. He has 
been in the adventure travel and ecotourism
 business since the mid-1970s when he combined his love of excitement and 
entrepreneurial flair by leading a rafting
 trip down the Awash, a little-known, crocodile and hippo-infested river 
in Africa.
<P>That was the beginning of Mountain Travel-Sobek and a mighty oak has 
now grown from that small acorn. The
 company is a paperless office, with extensive use of e-mail and 
Internet. Its promotional material is on 'Adventure
 Disk', a photo CD which previews the exotic sights and sounds of 
potential destinations through the use of stereo
 audio and high-resolution photography.
<P>Stanley Selengut has also taken nature-based travel to lofty new 
heights during his two decades in the industry.
 Some 18 years ago he developed the Maho Bay campground resort on St John 
in the Virgin Islands National Park.
 Here, 114 open-air tent cabins are connected by walkways above the 
forest floor so there is minimal disturbance to
 the natural surroundings.
<P>His next venture, the Harmony Resort built in the Virgin Islands in 
1991, went a step further in combining the latest ecological ideas, 
designs and technologies. With its recycled newspaper
 floorboards and crushed glass roof tiles, it is also the world's first 
luxury resort to operate exclusively on sun and wind
 power.
<P>Some of the best of Australia's ecotourism designers, consultants and 
operators will join these two American
 ecotourism pioneers to address the forum, including award-winning 
architect Ken Latona (of Cradle Mountain Huts
 and Freycinet Experience fame) and John Gertsakis (of the Royal 
Melbourne Institute of Technology's Centre for
 Design).
<P>For information on the forum contact Tanya Tear, Department of 
Tourism, on <NOBR>(06) 279 7234.</NOBR> For information on, or
 to register for, the broader conference contact Cherise Walmsley, EAA, 
on <NOBR>(07) 221 1811.</NOBR>

The award-winning Nitmiluk Tours, a joint venture between the Jawoyn

 visitors to enjoy and learn about the cultural heritage of Katherine 
Gorge, NT, as well as its magnificent
 natural features.

</CITE><BR clear=all>
<P>A proposed National Ecotourism Accreditation Scheme (NEAS) will be the 
focus of a series of consultations soon to be held across Australia with 
a
 sample of operators.
<P>The industry-based scheme aims to establish Australia as a world 
leader, both in the delivery of tourism services
 and the way in which tour operators and their customers interact with 
the environment. The consultations will define national principles which 
those involved in the ecotourism industry must meet if they wish
 to be accredited, and will establish models of 'best practice'.
<P>The proposed scheme grew out of a report to the Department of Tourism 
by Manidis Roberts Consultants who
 investigated the feasibility of accreditation and, after extensive 
consultation with industry, government, land
 managers, trainers and consumers, recommended the form a national scheme 
should take.
 The initial proposal was made available for public comment, and as a 
result it was determined that the scheme be
 modified to meet concerns, particularly about cost and administration.
<P>The modification is being undertaken through a joint project, funded 
under the National Ecotourism Program,
 between the Tourism Council Australia (TCA), the Ecotourism Association 
of Australia (EEA) and the Victorian Tourism
 Operators Association (VTOA). While the TCA is managing the project, the 
EAA is providing its practical expertise in establishing national
 ecotourism standards for product delivery, service and training, taking 
into account regional differences and needs. These standards will be 
incorporated into a tourism accreditation model to be developed by VTOA. 
The new model
 will then be pilot-tested and fine-tuned through a cross-section of the 
industry to test both its acceptability and
 application to all the key stakeholders.
<P>The concept of an accreditation scheme has received wide support from 
ecotourism operators keen to distinguish
 their genuine product from others that claim the ecotourism tag. It aims 
not only to enhance the marketability of authentic operators, but also to 
give Australia a competitive edge in
 that visitors will come to know that if they choose an accredited 
operator for an ecotourism experience they will get
 a quality product.
<P>Ecotourism combines a growing interest in and awareness of the natural 
environment with a strong educational and
 interpretive component. Visitors to an area not only enjoy their 
experience but learn from it - and with minimal
 environmental impact.
<P>For further information contact Steven Holle, TCA, on <NOBR>(02) 360 
3500,</NOBR> Tony Charters, EEA, on <NOBR>(07) 229 7483,</NOBR> Peter

In brief

<H2>
Tourism and Leisure Index celebrates first birthday
</H2>
<P>On 8 August 1994, the Tourism and Leisure Index was established to 
enable potential investors to track and assess
 the performance of tourism-related companies.
<P>It recently celebrated its first birthday with some very impressive 
results:
<UL>
<LI>The return on investment (including dividends and capital gains) 
across companies included in the index was
 14.8 per cent compared with a 7.4 per cent return from companies across 
the benchmark All Ordinaries Index (AOI).<P>


<LI>Of the 39 indexes, the Tourism and Leisure Index was the fourth best 
performing.<P>


<LI>In its first 12 months it grew from a nine-stock index capitalised at 
$3.6 billion to a fourteen-stock index
 capitalised at $5.7 billion.<P>


<LI>Of the $16.9 billion of equity raised on the Australian market last 
year, more than 8 per cent was directly
 attributable to the tourism and leisure sector.
</UL>
<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR ALIGN=Center><P>


 <H2>
Fast-tracking visa applications
</H2>
<P>By the end of the year, tourists from at least 16 countries will be 
able to get Australian visas from selected travel
 agencies within 24 hours.
<P>Under the 'Agency Arrangement' scheme, visa applicants' details are 
collected by a travel agent or airline and
 transmitted electronically to the local Australian migration office for 
a quick decision, removing the need for people
 to go to an Australian mission to obtain their visa.
<P>The scheme was initially trialled, with great success, in Japan and 
was extended to the United Kingdom, Singapore,
 Malaysia, South Korea, Hong Kong and Slovenia in June. It is soon to be 
expanded again to North America, Italy,
 Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Indonesia and 
Tahiti.<P>

<H2>
More than a rock and a croc
</H2>
<P>Australia must broaden its image as a tourist destination if it is to 
continue to compete with the emerging Asian
 markets for the international tourist dollar.
<P>That was the key message of an address to the 20th Ansett Travel and 
Transport Writers Seminar delivered by Federal
 Minister for Tourism, Michael Lee, on 27 August.
<P>Mr Lee said that, to many throughout the world, Australia was still 
perceived only in terms of beaches, the Rock and
 Crocodile Dundee. The reality is that Australia is an exciting, 
sophisticated and culturally diverse place that should be
 promoted in that light.
<P>To that end, the Australian Tourist Commission is investing $100 
million over the next three years on a new global
 television and print advertising campaign to sell Australia as a 
high-quality and diverse holiday destination. The series
 of ads will be seen in 10 countries by an estimated 500 million 
consumers.
<P>Mr Lee also stressed the importance of encouraging, but not 
exploiting, indigenous tourism ventures and managing
 the impact of tourism on ecologically sensitive areas such as national 
parks, world heritage areas and our coastlines.

New study of tourists with a disability
</H2>
<P>Tourism New South Wales and the Centre for Leisure and Tourism Studies 
at Sydney's University of Technology are
 currently investigating the tourism patterns of New South Wales 
residents with a physical disability.
<P>The study is focusing specifically on:
<UL>
<LI>patterns of domestic, overseas and day trips; <P>


<LI>travel requirements, reasons for travel and non-travel, and barriers 
encountered.
</UL>
 <P>A questionnaire-based survey was sent to 8500 members of 10 
organisations representing people with a physical
 disability. To date, more than 2000 responses have been received and the 
preliminary analysis is expected to be
 completed by the end of September.
<P>The study aims to provide a quantitative base on which government and 
industry can make informed decisions
 about meeting the tourism needs of people with a physical disability.
<P>For further information contact Simon Darcy by phone: <NOBR>(02) 330

 A QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER FROM THE
<BR>COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENT OF TOURISM </H2>
<IMG BORDER=3 HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 SRC="14b.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT>

<P>
<EM>In the year 2003, overseas visitors to Australia will spend over $14 
billion, excluding expenditure on international air fares. Most of these 
tourists (some 6 out of 10) will be from Asia, with a growing number from 
emerging markets such as Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea.</EM>
<P>
The commercial accommodation sector will be a big winner, with the number 
of international visitor nights spent in hotels, motels and guest houses 
increasing from 15 million in 1993 to 42 million in 2003. 
<P>
These predictions are made in <I>Forecast </I>magazine, the second report 
of the Tourism Forecasting Council (TFC), released in April. 
<P>
The TFC is the peak advisory body to government and industry on future 
movements within the various sectors of Australia's tourism industry - 
its sophisticated forecasts providing vital information for sound 
investment and policy decision making.
<P>
The April issue of <I>Forecast </I>contains its most recent predictions, 
giving detailed information on visitor arrivals, resident departures, 
international visitor nights and expenditure, and the number of nights 
spent by international visitors in hotels, motels and guest houses. It 
also discusses the latest use of 'tourism leading indicators' in 
determining  short-term arrivals trends.<P>

<LI> Amount of money spent directly in Australia by international 
visitors to increase from $5.4 billion in 1993 to over $12 billion in

<LI> The total number of nights spent in Australia by international 
visitors to grow from 69 million in 1993 to 144 million in 2003 - an 
average annual growth rate of 8 per cent.<P>
<LI> Amount of money spent on pre-paid travel packages to increase from 
$700 million in 1993 to around $2.4 billion in 2003 - an average annual 
growth rate of 12.7 per cent. <P>
<LI> Based on current data, the projected increase in international 
visitor nights in hotels, motels and guest houses from 15 million in 1993 
to 42 million in 2003 is expected to create demand for an additional 15 
million <I>room nights</I> in the year 2003 - more than half for visitors 
from Asian countries other than Japan.<P>
<LI> Average length of stay of international visitors to decline, due 
largely to the increase in number of short-staying holiday makers from 
Asian countries other than Japan, but average expenditure per day per 
person to continue to rise.

Talking Tourism - Funding to ensure popular attractions aren't 'Loved to 
Death'
</TITLE>

<BODY BACKGROUND="/images/yellow_rock.gif"> 
<IMG BORDER=3 HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 SRC="Lovedtodeath.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT>
Victoria's Hanging Rock, Western Australia's Wave Rock, Kangaroo Island's 
Seal Bay, and Tasmania's Cradle Mountain are just four of 14 popular, 
natural attractions that are to receive Federal Government funding to 
protect them for the enjoyment of future generations.<P>
More than $660 000 in grants has been awarded under the Government's 
Sites of National Tourism Significance (SONTS) program to ensure that 
these natural icons are protected and aren't 'loved to death' by 
tourists.<P>

In announcing the grants, the Federal Minister for Tourism, Michael Lee, 
said the funding would be used to ensure that the special qualities that 
make these sites so attractive to Australians and overseas visitors  
alike are retained for future generations of visitors.<P>

Mr Lee said that responsible tourism development means attracting the 
maximum number of visitors to Australia while also protecting our unique 
and valuable natural drawcards.<P>

"This can be a very delicate balancing act given the growing importance 
of tourism to local economies, particularly in creating jobs," Mr Lee 
said.<P>

SONTS funding is provided to natural sites of national tourism 
significance to minimise the environmental impact of tourism, increase 
understanding of tourism management in sensitive areas and enhance 
visitor appreciation of the environmental value of these natural tourist 
icons.<P>

The SONTS grants, which were announced in May, come under the second 
round of funding offered under the Government's three-year, $2 million 
SONTS program.<P>

Talking Tourism - Royal National Park to receive $81 150
</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY BACKGROUND="/images/yellow_rock.gif">

<IMG BORDER=3 HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 SRC="SONTSgrant.GIF"  ALIGN=LEFT> The devastating bushfires of 
January 1994 had a severe effect on Australia's oldest national park, the 
Royal National Park in Sydney, damaging 95 per cent of the 15 000 
hectares of vegetation.<P>

Ironically, the terrible fires have offered a unique opportunity to act 
to improve some of the park's infrastructure. 
<P>
The spectacular and immensely popular 26-kilometre Coast Walk had been in 
need of upgrading due to soil erosion caused by heavy use and unstable 
sandy surfaces even before the fires. With the coastal heath now burnt 
back, an opportunity exists to survey and reconstruct the track along 
better planned and more environmentally sensitive routes. 
<P>
Each year 1.8 million people visit the park and more than 30 000 walk the 
track.  The number of visitors is likely to rise dramatically over the 
next few years with increased tourism to Australia and the 
fast-approaching Sydney 2000 Olympics. 
<P>
To help protect the park from the impact of growing numbers of tourists, 
especially now that burnt out areas are beginning to regenerate, an $81 
150 grant from the Federal Government's SONTS program has been awarded to 
the park. 
<P>
The grant will be used to restore the section of the Coast Walk from 
Jibbon Beach to Marley. 
<P>
In announcing the grant, Federal Minister for Tourism, Mr Michael Lee, 
said there was an urgent need to ensure we could meet the needs of 
tourists without putting at risk the regeneration of this fragile 
environment. 
<P>
The SONTS grant will help to ensure that tourists won't be prevented from 
exploring the park's magnificent and diverse scenery. 
<P>
"SONTS is designed to help balance competing priorities by providing 
funding to enhance people's appreciation of our great natural assets 
while at the same time limiting the environmental impact of tourism," 
said Mr Lee. 
<P>
The  New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service received the 
grant on behalf of the park.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">
Australia's growing ecotourism industry has received a healthy injection 
of funds with the recent announcement of nearly $2 million in Federal 
Government grants. 
<P>
The $1.4 million offered under the National Ecotourism Program (NEP) and 
$0.43 million offered under the third round of the Forest Ecotourism 
Program (FEP) will go to 52 projects which aim to increase opportunities 
for tourists to experience and learn about our natural environment while 
making a major contribution to environmental conservation and management. 

<P>
Announcing the grants on World Environment Day, Federal Minister for 
Tourism, Michael Lee, said that Australia, with its spectacular natural 
features, remarkable flora and fauna, and unique cultural heritage, had 
the potential to become one of the world's most favoured ecotourism 
destinations. 
<P>
"Our success depends, however, on how well we manage, conserve and 
present our valuable ecotourism resources," he said. 
<P>
"Projects such as those being funded will help to enhance our reputation 
as a world leader in the sensitive and sustainable development of 
ecotourism." 
<P>
The NEP funding is for 32 infrastructure, planning or research projects 
across all States and Territories. They range from research into the 
effects of human activity on our fauna and flora, including the impact on 
dolphins of people swimming nearby, to the use of new energy-efficient 
technology at Broome's Bird Observatory. 
<P>
The FEP funding is for 20 projects which will help people to explore and 
better understand our magnificent forest areas while at the same time 
protecting the environmental values that draw people to the forests. 
<P>
<B><I>"Our success depends, however, on how well we manage, conserve and 
present our valuable ecotourism resources." </I></B>
<P>
The projects cover a range of forest types - from Queensland's tropical 
rainforests to the alpine woodlands of Victoria's high country - and 
include walking tracks to help people appreciate local flora, fauna and 
indigenous culture, a solar-powered FM radio forest information service 
and a multi-media geographic information system for planning  
and promoting forest ecotourism.
<P>
Applications for grants under the 1995-96 round of funding will be called 
for in August. For further information on the NEP, please call Ken Morgan 
Nature Based and Indigenous Tourism, (06) 279 7149. For further 
information on FEP please call Mary Jinman, Environment Management (06) 
279 7147.

<IMG BORDER=3 HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20  SRC="LobourMarkets.GIF"><P>
The tourism industry has good potential for continued strong employment 
growth and is 'ripe' for enterprise bargaining.  This was one of the 
conclusions at a workshop on tourism labour markets and employment held 
in Melbourne on 31 May-1 June.
<P>
Organised by the Department of Tourism and the Industry Commission, the 
workshop attracted representatives from key industry organisations, 
unions, government departments, hotel operators, and labour market 
economists and researchers. 
<P>
The forum featured panel-style discussions following each formal 
presentation - ensuring stimulating and thought provoking debate. A key 
feature was the international perspective on 'tourism related employment 
and the unemployed' brought to the discussions by Dr Marilyn Mohan from 
Canada's Mana Research Limited. 
<P>
Some of the key issues raised at the workshop were that: 
<P>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> Tourism's share of total Australian employment has increased in 
recent years. 
<LI> Inbound tourism's share of total employment is expected to double 
over the next decade. 
<LI> Tourism employment is largely represented by young, female and 
casual workers. 
<LI> Tourism can be an effective job generator, creating jobs which are 
suited to a high proportion of job seekers. 
<LI> Measuring the employment impact of tourism growth requires detailed 
information about labour market conditions and links between industries. 

<LI> The characteristics of the tourism labour market, the flexibility 
available to deploy labour and overall labour market conditions have 
enabled Australia's tourism industry to adjust to increased demand 
without major difficulties. 
<LI> The challenge for enterprise bargaining in the tourism industry is 
to improve efficiency and skills in the workplace by spreading bargaining 
to the large number of small to medium sized operators. 
<LI> For tourism to realise its full potential we must have an 
appropriately trained workforce to meet the industry's possible labour 
requirements for the next century.
</UL> 
<P>
It was also noted that the development of a Tourism Satellite Account (a 
statistical means of linking tourism to the national accounts)  in 
Australia would provide a statistical framework to measure the 
contribution tourism makes to the economy and would greatly assist in 
formulating policies that affect the industry. 
<P>

the workshop, contactKylie Hill, Economic Policy Branch, on (06) 279

<H3>NEW REPORT ON TOURISM LABOUR MARKETS</H3>
<P>
Tourism is a relatively labour intensive industry, and employment in 
tourism-related industries has experienced rapid growth over the past 
decade. 
<P>
The industry is creating jobs across a range of skill levels and has the 
capacity to provide jobs for many groups vulnerable to long-term 
unemployment - groups such as the young, the unskilled and people from 
different cultural backgrounds. Tourism is also helping to diversify the 
employment base of regional economies. 
<P>
<I>Photo courtesy of the ATC</I>
<IMG BORDER=3 HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 SRC="Photoofpeople.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT><P>
Given the future potential of the industry for job creation, the 
department commissioned the Western Australian Labour Market Research 
Centre to examine the operation of the tourism labour market to gain a 
better understanding of the nature of employment in the industry. 
<P>
The outcomes of that study are now available in a new publication, <I>How 
Tourism Labour Markets Work.</I> 
<P>
The report, the first in a new series of research papers to be published 
by the Department of Tourism, uses statistical analysis and case study 
research to examine the structure of employment in the industry and how 
it adjusts to fluctuations in demand. 
<P>
It looks at issues such as staff recruitment and turnover, employee 
earnings and mobility, the educational levels of staff, training 
arrangements and the development of career paths. 
<P>
The report is important reading for tourism operators, and private and 
public sector agencies involved in the future development of the tourism 
industry's workforce. 
<P>
<ADDRESS>Copies are available from the department's information officer 
on (06) 279 7162 or 008 804 465.</ADDRESS><P>

<H3>SPECIAL AWARD FOR NEW TOURIST INFO CENTRE</H3>
<P>
The Snowy River Shire Council has received a $50 000 Tourism Minister's 
'special award' for the use of innovative energy-conserving technology 
and recycled products in the construction of the new Jindabyne Tourist 
Information Centre. 
<P>
It is the first time such an award has been made. 
<P>
Plans for the new centre include the use of a range of recycled products 
both inside and outside the building, including recycled timber floor and 
wall panelling, second hand bricks for paving, and recycled timber and 
plastics in the landscaping. 
<P>
Energy conservation options being considered include geothermal heating 
and cooling systems, double glazing, controlled power usage and automated 
internal lighting systems. 
<P>
When finished, the building will be a showcase for visitor centres 
throughout Australia, and as the gateway to the Snowy Mountains, will 
help pave the way for further innovation in recycled products and energy 
conservation techniques in Australian building design.

The kit will address issues such as product development, business 
planning, marketing, cooperation between industries, infrastructure - 
essential information for successful tourism involvement. 
<P>
The information kit will be available towards the end of the year at a 
cost of around $20.00.

<H2>Rural Tourism Program</H2> 
<P>
Rural and regional areas of Australia can offer both domestic and 
international tourists an unlimited range of experiences. But with only 
one-third of overseas visitors currently venturing beyond the big cities 
and major gateways, country areas have yet to realise the full potential 
of tourism.
<P>
The Federal Government's four-year, $4 million, Rural Tourism Program 
(RTP) aims to address this issue by funding innovative projects to help 
rural Australia gain a greater share of the tourist dollar. Discretionary 
grants have so far been targeted at projects which involve market 
analysis, raising industry standards, education and training, and 
product/infrastructure development.
<P>
An important aspect of the RTP is that the approach taken in these 
individual projects can be adapted for use right across the country - 
they are examples to others of what can be achieved with a little 
foresight, imagination and commitment.
<P>
Six major projects have received $610 000 under the RTP in 1994-95:
<P>
$145 000 for an agricultural interpretation centre at the University of 
Adelaide's Roseworthy Campus (District Council of Light).
<P>
$128 400 for a tourist trail which will link the quality wine and food 
producing areas around Albury - Wodonga with the heritage and scenery of 
the Victorian high country (Tourism Albury Wodonga).

<H2>Regional Tourism Development Program</H2> 
<P>
Like the RTP, the Regional Tourism Development Program (RTDP) is designed 
to help spread the economic and social benefits of tourism throughout 
rural and regional Australia.
<P>
This year, the Government delivered $6.2 million in funding under the 
highly competitive program for 54 projects which will help improve the 
capacity of regional Australia to attract both domestic and international 
tourists.
<P>
In New South Wales, 15 projects received $1.2 million in funding, ranging 
from initiatives to market the State's mining and industrial heritage as 
a tourist drawcard, to the development of strategies to guide the future 
growth of tourism in specific regions.
<P>
Eight Victorian projects received a total of $1.7 million, with most of 
the funding to be used to build modern visitor information and 
interpretive centres to introduce travellers to the scenic, historic and 
cultural wealth of the Geelong Sunraysia, Echuca-Moama and Upper Yarra 
regions.
<P>
The West attracted $1 million, including a $400 000 grant for the 
construction of a Tourism Information Gateway - a one-stop shop for 
visitors and investors alike - in Kununurra. 
<P>
A $600 000 package went to Queensland for seven projects, five of which 
will involve the development of comprehensive regional tourism plans, 
while South Australia received 
<P>
$800 000 for seven projects including new visitor information centres for 
the McLaren Vale and Riverland regions and for Kangaroo Island.
<P>
In Tasmania, seven projects received a total of $500 000 in funding, 
including a $100 000 grant to restore Australia's first hydro-electric 
power station in Cataract Gorge as a tourist drawcard.
<P>
The Northern Territory attracted $200 000 in funding for two projects - a 
tourist complex at Tennant Creek's historic 'Battery Hill' gold stamp 
site and a tourism development plan for the region covering Gove, 
Nhulunby and Groote Eylandt.
<P>
The Federal Minister for Tourism, Michael Lee, said the projects 
reflected the scale and diversity of the largely untapped tourism product 
in areas outside of the major metropolitan centres.  
<P>
Applications for RTDP grants under the 1995-96 round of funding will be 
sought in early July. <ADDRESS>For further information please call Jane 
Bailey, Regional Development, (06) 279 7192.</ADDRESS>

<H2>Rural Tourism? - The Sky's the Limit!</H2>
<P>
`Passport to the Stars', a new enterprise which markets our astronomical 
achievements as a major new tourist attraction, is proof that 'the sky's 
the limit' for tourism in rural Australia.
<P>
The special passport will provide people travelling the Newell Highway 
with an informative guide to 10 major optical and radio telescope 
observatories and space tracking stations in NSW and the ACT. It will 
also highlight other tourist attractions in the nearby communities of 
Cowra, Parkes, Dubbo, Gilgandra, Coonabarabran, Canberra and Narrabri.
<IMG BORDER=3 HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 SRC="Satelite.GIF" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>
As they travel along the 'astro highway', visitors will have their 
passports stamped as a unique reminder of their experiences.  
<P>
Launching the passport in Parkes recently, Federal Parliamentary 
Secretary Paul Elliott said it was a great example of what could be 
achieved when tourism opportunities were developed, packaged and marketed 
with flair and creativity. 
<P>
"With the project being funded through a $46 000 RTP grant, it also 
demonstrates the effectiveness of that program in encouraging innovation 
in rural tourism," Mr Elliott said.

</I><P>

<B><I>Ensuring tourism is accessible to all people makes sound business 
sense. </I></B>

<P>One in every six Australians has some form of disability, ranging from 
asthma through to a severe physical or intellectual disability, and with 
Australia's population ageing rapidly this figure is expected to reach 
one in five within the next decade. (1993 ABS Survey of Disability, 
Ageing and Carers).
<P>
People who have a disability have the same aspirations and expectations 
of life as those who don't - including the desire to experience the 
excitement and enjoyment that travel can bring. <P>

<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4 ALIGN=Center><P>
<H2><I>But there is a problem.</I></H2>
<P>
<STRONG>
For a large group of people whose mobility, or sight, or 
hearing is impaired, the hurdles and frustrations they 
experience as a tourist are at times so daunting that they 
rule out many travel options.
</STRONG><P>

These obstacles can range from lack of information, to difficulties with 
transport.  This can mean that someone simply cannot gain access to an 
attraction, or that they face additional, often hefty, expenses to get 
there in the first place.
<P>
Whatever the hurdle, the result is the same - a lost opportunity to enjoy 
the things that most of us take for granted and a lost opportunity for 
Australia's tourism industry to tap into a large and growing 
international and domestic travel market.
<P>
While some enterprising individuals and organisations within the tourism 
industry are already improving facilities for people with a disability, 
we have a long way to go. 
<P>
Many rightly see the issue of increasing access for people with a 
disability in terms of it being a social and legislative responsibility 
with the introduction of the <I>Disability Discrimination Act 1992</I>.
<P>
But it also makes good business sense to better cater for, and actively 
market to, a significantly large group of consumers - with the Sydney 
2000 Olympics and the Paralympics on the horizon, there are sound 
economic reasons to do so.
<P>
While much of the work to remove the barriers can only be done at 
government level, through changes to major infrastructure for example, 
with a little forethought much can also be done within the industry to 
create a more accessible environment for all consumers.
<P>
If you are already in the business of tourism, ask yourself the following 
questions to make a very basic assessment of how accessible your facility 
or enterprise is. If you are thinking of getting into the business -- 
whether it be through designing a new hotel or operating a guided tour -- 
examine its design to ensure you don't inadvertently exclude a large part 
of the population and therefore limit your business potential.
<P>
If you would like further information or checklists on how to assess and 
modify your premises or facility, and which Australian standards to 
follow, contact ACROD (Australia's peak council of disability services) 
on (06) 282 4333 (national office) or its State Divisional offices in 
each capital city.
<P>
Independent Living Centres in each State and Territory can also advise on 
equipment or fittings that are suitable for people with a disability, and 
local consumer organisations for people with a disability can also help 
you to determine how needs can be better met.
<P>
Future issues of <I>Talking Tourism</I> will feature case studies on what 
some organisations are already doing to better cater to the needs of 
these consumers.

Talking Tourism - Budget Good News for Tourism Operators
</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY BACKGROUND="/images/yellow_rock.gif"> 
<IMG BORDER=3 HSPACE=20 VSPACE=20 SRC="Budget.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT>

<P>
<B>Pre-Budget fears about the introduction of a bed tax and a significant 
reduction in funding to the Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) were laid 
to rest on 9 May when the Federal Government brought down its 1995-96 
Budget.</B> 
<P>
The bed tax proposal was rejected and ATC funding was maintained in a 
Federal Budget aimed at increasing business investment by 13 per cent, 
encouraging employment growth by 3 per cent during 1995-96, keeping 
interest rates and inflation down and boosting national savings. 
<P>
Accelerated development of Sydney West Airport, continued funding for 
Department of Tourism programs and ongoing support for the research and 
statistical initiatives of the Bureau of Tourism Research and the Tourism 
Forecasting Council were features of a Budget that encourages investment 
in growth industries such as tourism. 
<P>
In preparation for the Sydney 2000 Olympics, $762 million was allocated 
to construct international and domestic airport facilities at Sydney 
West, including road links to Sydney City, and to identify a rail 
corridor.  
<P>
Costs for development of Sydney West will be recouped from a special 
charge on Sydney airport users equivalent to approximately $1.70 per 
passenger. 
<P>
Key tourism highlights of the Budget were the continued funding for 
ongoing programs: 
<P>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> $5.2 million for the Regional Tourism Development Program; 
<LI> $3.4 million for the National Ecotourism Program and the Forest 
Ecotourism Program; 
<LI> $0.7 million for the Sites of National Tourism Significance Program; 
and 
<LI> $2.6 million to stimulate the development of special interest 
tourism markets including rural tourism, the backpacker market and cruise 
shipping.
</UL> 
<P>

These programs are encouraging regional tourism development, expanding 
ecotourism and helping to develop niche markets. 
<P>
Support for the Tourism Forecasting Council and the Bureau of Tourism 
Research will also continue, with $1.3 million provided to the BTR for 
the ongoing development of the tourism industry's statistical and 
research base. 
<P>
The ATC will receive a record $80 million to continue its overseas 
marketing activities.  When supplemented by industry contributions, the 
ATC's total budget expenditure is expected to be some $111 million. 
<P>
The Budget also provides funds to give single service tourism operators 
access to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme.  Operators will be 
able to claim eligible promotional expenditure incurred in 1994-95. 
<P>
Changes to visitor entry requirements should facilitate easier entry for 
business travellers. To streamline and simplify entry procedures, 
temporary resident categories for business people have been reduced to a 
single visa class.   
<P>
In addition, periods of stay for visa applicants have been redesigned to 
include: 
<P>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> a one-month category with no application fee; 
<LI> a three-month, multiple entry category valid for five years or the 
life of a passport (whichever is greater), with an application fee of 
$35; and  
<LI> a greater than three-month category, with the existing application 
fee of $140 (due to rise by $5 on 1 July 1995 owing to indexation). 
</UL>
<P>
To improve the nation's roadways, the Budget allocated $840 million for 
construction and maintenance of the national highway system. 
<P>
The Budget also included a number of initiatives that will help to 
conserve and manage environmental resources important to Australians and 
visitors: 
<P>
<!-- List Tag -->
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> an additional $14 million for the Great Barrier Marine Park 
Authority for planning and environmental management; 
<LI> increased funding of $6 million for the National Protected Areas 
Program, which includes the management of national parks; 
<LI> $53 million to improve management of Australia's coastline; 
<LI> $53 million to implement the National Forest Policy Statement; and  

<LI> an additional $5 million for conservation and management of 
Australia's wetlands. </UL><P>

<H2><I>Leading Indicators of Australian Visitor Arrivals (BTR Occasional 
Paper No. 19)</I></H2>
<P>

A reliable view of the short-term prospects for inbound visitor numbers 
is essential for tourism business and policy decisions.
<P>
In this report, 'leading indicators' have been identified which give 
advance warning of movements about the long-term trend in visitor 
arrivals, from one to two years ahead of the actual movement. These 
indicators are OECD gross domestic product, OECD unemployment and the 
Trade Weighted Index.
<P>
The indicators show that the growth rate in short-term visitor arrivals 
to Australia will ease during the next few years, with growth in this 
area seeming to have reached a cyclical peak in late 1993 when tourist 
numbers increased by 15 per cent in one year.
<P>
Arrivals are now expected to grow at a more moderate rate for the next 
two to three years, although the present recovery in the world economy 
should stimulate an increase in the growth rate again after that time.

This major new publication from the Bureau of Tourism Research (BTR) 
provides the first detailed profile of Australia's domestic and 
international backpacker market.
<P>
It examines the characteristics and behaviour of this type of traveller, 
exploding the long-held belief that backpackers are tourists on a 
shoestring budget - they actually stay longer, spend more, visit more 
regions, use more forms of travel and take part in more activities than 
other types of tourist.

The report gives detailed data on backpackers' reasons for travelling, 
where they visit and how long they stay for, their age, sex and 
occupation, the activities they participate in, and how much they spend,

</A></H3>
<P>In recognition of the growing significance of the backpacker market,
the Government is providing almost $4 million over four years to 1996-97
for the development of this market.</P><P></P><P>The Program aims to:</P><UL
>
<LI>facilitate the development of a viable, professional and
internationally competitive backpacker  industry;</LI>
<LI>facilitate wider dispersion of the employment, economic and social
benefits of tourism throughout the Australian community; and</LI>
<LI>provide opportunities to broaden the tourism product base and cater
for a wider cross-section of visitors.</LI></UL><P></P><P>Broadly, the
Backpacker Program is expected to reduce impediments to growth, expand
marketing networks, improve standards in the backpacker accommodation
sector, encourage a strategic approach to the development of the market
and to ensure a positive return to the economy.</P><P></P><P>Under the
first year of the Program, $830 000 was allocated to the Australian
Tourist Commission (ATC) to undertake marketing activities in the short
term, specifically targeted to the backpacker market with concentration
on priority international markets including the UK, North America,
Japan, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Scandinavia.</P><P></P><P>A
scheme for classifying backpacker accommodation is being developed in
conjunction with the Australian Automobile Association (AAA), its
constituent members and key industry groups.  The scheme is intended to
provide recognisable standards of quality of facilities for the
information of tourism operators and travellers.</P><P></P><P>A
Strategic Plan for the development of the backpacker market in the
medium to longer term is also being prepared.  The Plan, which is being
developed in consultation with the tourism industry and State and
Territory tourism authorities, will provide direction for future funding
initiatives.</P><P></P><P>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:</P><P>The Director</P><P

SHIPPING STRATEGY
</A></H3>
<P>The international cruise shipping industry has been one of the
fastest growing segments of the tourism industry over the last decade. 
As existing destinations become overcrowded, operators are likely to be
seeking new locations to base their ships and new itineraries to attract
both first-time and repeat passengers.  This suggests that there is a
window of opportunity for the Australian tourism industry.</P><P></P><P>
The Government is currently developing a National Cruise Shipping
Strategy with a view to determining the most advantageous operating
environment for foreign cruise ships, within the framework of broader
Government policy.</P><P></P><P>Funding was provided in the 1993-94
Budget and work is progressing on the development of both policy and
promotional aspects of the Strategy.</P><P></P><P>Following extensive
government and industry consultation, a discussion paper,
<I>Towards a National Cruise Shipping Strategy</I>, was released for
public comment.  The discussion paper provides an overview of issues
affecting cruise ships in Australia.</P><P></P><P>Action is also under
way to promote Australia as a cruise destination.  The Department of
Tourism contributed to a major ATC/industry cooperative print media
campaign in the United Kingdom, and for the first time, Australia had a
strong presence at Seatrade Miami, the major annual international cruise
shipping trade fair.  The ATC, with funding assistance from the
Department, coordinated an Australia-New Zealand stand with the theme
`Cruising Down Under'.  A database of ports was produced by the
Department to provide details of port facilities and essential support
services and includes a facility to create itineraries. The database was
distributed to international cruise operators.  An updated database will
be released shortly.</P><P></P><P>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION:</P><P>The

FORECASTING COUNCIL
</A></H3>
<P>In 1993, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the
Tourism Forecasting Council (TFC).</P><P></P><P>The Council is a high
profile reporting body comprised of representatives from the tourism,
finance, construction, property and union sectors.  It is supported by a
technically oriented advisory body chaired by the Director of the Bureau
of Tourism Research (BTR).</P><P></P><P>The primary aim of the Council
is to produce and disseminate credible and timely forecasts of industry
activity as a basis for sound investment decision-making.  This will
help to avoid the boom and bust cycles of investment activity that have
characterised the industry in the past.  The Council's work has gained
momentum with the publication of its first report
<I>Forecast </I>in August 1994 which focuses on forecasts of domestic
tourism and the TFC's sponsorship of a tourism and leisure index on the
Australian Stock Exchange.  Areas of future TFC work include:</P><UL>
<LI>forecasts of international visitor arrivals by country/region,
leading indicators of international arrivals, and forecasts of outbound

by Austrade, the ITES is directed at projects that will generate at
least $10 million in NFE earnings over five years.  Finance of up to

basis of Austrade contributing $1 for every $20 of projected NFE
earnings.</P><P></P><P>Support is provided in the form of either a
concessional loan or an advance which attracts royalty payments
calculated as a percentage of export revenues. Concessional loans are
interest free for the first three years.  The interest rate currently
averages around 1.8 per cent per annum over the six-year period of the
loan.</P><P></P><P>To qualify for ITES, applicants must first complete

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC2">AUSINDUSTRY</A></H2>
<P>One of the key industry assistance initiatives outlined in the
Government's May 1994 White Paper, <I>Working Nation</I>, is the
development of AusIndustry. The Office of AusIndustry, within the
Department of Industry, Science and Technology, will improve the
coordination and delivery of business assistance programs, and provide a
better, more focused service to Australian business.  A private
sector-led Board of AusIndustry will guide these efforts.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC3">BUSINESSLINK</A></H3>
<P>Through BusinessLink, the Commonwealth is working cooperatively with
State and Territory Governments to develop computer-based information
sources for small to medium-sized enterprises.  BusinessLink will
underpin AusIndustry's role as an entry point for all Commonwealth
business improvement programs, and will include a quality information
and referral service and a marketing network for the programs of other
Departments.</P>
<P></P>
<P>BusinessLink's objectives are to:</P>
<P></P>
<UL><LI>provide access to business information when required;</LI>
<LI></LI>
<LI>provide information in the most cost effective manner;</LI>
<LI></LI>
<LI>provide information in a proactive way; and</LI>
<LI></LI>
<LI>provide information in a useable format.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>BusinessLink will provide information about export services, tenders
and other business opportunities, finance, business assistance measures
and programs, technology and product information, licensing
requirements, taxation, industrial awards, management advice and
training and industry assistance measures and services.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC4">BIZHELP</A></H3>
<P>The first BusinessLink product to be marketed will be a new
computer-based guide to programs and services called BizHelp. BizHelp
will provide an accurate computer disk information guide on the full
range of Commonwealth and State industry support measures, as well as
selected private sector programs.  The guide is designed for use by
business advisers and includes a software package in diskette form,
quarterly updates, a basic training package and access to a help desk
service.  It will be distributed to a large number of intermediaries
including AusIndustry centres, the National Industry Extension Service
(NIES) and Small Business Development Corporation (SBDC) offices,
industry associations, accountants and consultants.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Other BusinessLink products to be developed are expected to include
information products covering licensing requirements and training
sources.</P>
<P></P>
<P>BizHelp is currently being piloted in a number of sites and is
expected to be widely available by the end of 1994.</P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC5">NATIONAL INDUSTRY EXTENSION SERVICE
</A></H3>
<P>The National Industry Extension Service (NIES) is a joint
Commonwealth, State and Territory program which helps small and medium
sized Australian firms in the manufacturing and services sectors to
become internationally competitive through enterprise improvement. NIES'
overall strategy is to improve the internal efficiency and external
focus of enterprises and thereby to increase international
competitiveness.  Firms are encouraged to undertake enterprise
improvement activities as part of continuous improvement.</P>
<P></P>
<P>NIES has specially trained field officers in all States/Territories
to provide advice and information to firms. Firms can receive subsidies
to engage external consultants to facilitate and/or implement enterprise
improvement programs. While the level of funding is determined at the
State/Territory level, typically up to 50 per cent of the cost of
external advice is funded.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Since 1991-92, NIES has increased its focus on the services sector
through the Services Industry Extension Program (SIEP). SIEP aims to
raise the level of management and business skills in service industries
to enable them to compete more effectively in world markets.  The
initiative provides significant opportunities for increasing the
efficiency of the services sector and its contribution to export
earnings and import replacement.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Through SIEP, NIES provides firms with access to an expanded network
of accredited consultants, specialist field officers and a range of
enterprise improvement programs in best management practices.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In general, NIES subsidies are available to service firms with a
proven commercial record and a commitment to export.  States and
Territories target services sectors of significance to their regions,
including education, health, recreation and tourism.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The availability of NIES subsidies for tourism operators varies
between States and Territories.  The States and Territories that do
target subsidies to tourism operators use guidelines to limit subsidies
to firms with an export and performance record and a growth objective. 
In most cases, access to subsidies is decided on a case by case basis.</P>
<P></P>
<P>NIES has developed a range of programs for small to medium sized
enterprises, covering:</P>
<P></P>
<UL><LI>world competitive services;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>export market planning;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>benchmarking;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>total quality management; and</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>improvement through people.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC6">WORLD COMPETITIVE SERVICES
</A></H3>
<P>World Competitive Services (WCS) is a strategic planning process for
service based enterprises which emphasises that long-term success is
only achieved by companies continuously delivering superior value to
their chosen market segments.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The WCS process is designed to provide service-based enterprises
with a pragmatic, customer driven and effective strategic planning
process which culminates in the competitive repositioning of the company
in domestic and/or international markets.  The program includes:</P>
<P></P>
<UL><LI>customer and employee perceptions;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>competitor and best practice benchmarking;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>internal attitudes and climate; and</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>customer and service profitability.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>WCS is a tightly integrated strategic planning process which focuses
on identifying and improving those critical aspects of the company which
impact on its competitive position.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC7">EXPORT MARKET PLANNING
</A></H3>
<P>The Export Market Planning (EMP) program is designed to assist firms
to strategically plan and manage their exporting activities.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The program is delivered to firms by trained NIES consultants who
will tailor the program to suit the unique needs of individual companies
regardless of size, export base or market focus.  EMP contains an export
diagnostic and planning tool leading to the development of an effective
international marketing strategy.</P>
<P></P>
<P>EMP was developed in conjunction with Austrade and assistance is
available from Austrade for the market research components of the
program.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC8">BENCHMARKING</A></H3>
<P>Benchmarking is an ongoing systematic process to search for and
introduce international best practice into an organisation.</P>
<P></P>
<P>NIES and the Best Practice Demonstration Program, which is jointly
administered by the Department of  Industrial Relations and the
Australian Manufacturing Council, recently released the <I>Self-Help
Benchmarking Manual</I> providing:</P>
<P></P>
<UL><LI>a step-by-step guide to assist Australian firms to implement
benchmarking; and</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>smaller firms with access to clear and practical information on
benchmarking to enable them to design the most appropriate benchmarking
process for their organisation.</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC9">TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT
</A></H3>
<P>The Total Quality Management (TQM) program has as its primary
objective the achievement of international competitiveness for
Australian enterprises through the implementation of Total Quality
Management.</P>
<P></P>
<P>This management approach achieves continuous incremental improvement
in all processes, goods and services through the creative involvement of
all people. TQM is recognised as strategically important for a firm's
economic survival and as a major tool for lifting competitiveness in
world markets.</P>
<P></P>
<P>NIES Industry Advisers provide advice to help firms gain competitive
advantage through attention to TQM processes.  Financial subsidies are
available for eligible companies to enable them to engage consultants
licensed to deliver the NIES TQM `How to' model which is a uniquely
Australian interpretation of the world-wide TQM approach.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The TQM for Small business (TQMSB) program is flexible enough to
also assist smaller firms to plot their own course of development.</P>
<P></P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC10">IMPROVEMENT THROUGH PEOPLE
</A></H3>
<P>Improvement Through People (ITP) is a program designed to draw
together all the people-oriented elements which go into making a
successful company. While other NIES programs include the principles of
good people management, ITP deals more specifically with the human
elements of good business and provides specialist human resource
assistance to companies in areas such as workplace redesign, cultural
change, training and cooperative management.</P>
<P></P>
<P>NIES field officers in each State and Territory are specialist ITP
facilitators, trained to identify and advise on basic issues.</P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC11">ENTERPRISE NETWORK PROGRAM
</A></H3>
<P>The Enterprise Network Program assists small to medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) to cooperate in strategic areas of business.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Networking enables firms to develop joint solutions to common
problems which might be beyond the capabilities of a single enterprise. 
Firms in a network can exploit mutual strengths in resources, equipment
and markets, thereby improving their competitive position.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Enterprise Network Program provides support for an external
network broker to guide networks through a three-stage development
process.  This process involves looking into the network feasibility of
the idea in stage 1, establishing a business plan and legal basis in
stage 2, and beginning networking operations in stage 3.</P>

</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC3">TAX CONCESSIONS FOR PLANT AND BUILDINGS
</A></H3>
<P>An income tax deduction may be available for capital expenditure on
the construction of new buildings (including extensions, alterations or
improvements to buildings) for tourist purposes.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The buildings or extensions could include tourist accommodation,
apartments, units, flats, tourist attractions, resorts and restaurants.</P>
<P></P>
<P>For buildings used to provide short-term traveller accommodation and
which can produce assessable income, where construction commenced after
26 February 1992, the costs are written off at 4 per cent per annum over
25 years.  For buildings that commenced before 27 February 1992, other
rates may apply.  Your local tax office has details.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In addition, certain structural improvements such as sealed car
parks, sealed roads, sealed runways, seawalls, and covered shelters for
paths and outdoor activities can be written off at 2.5 per cent.</P>
<P></P>
<P>New depreciation rates for items of plant and equipment were
introduced on 26 February 1992 and relate to items purchased after that
date.  These rates, listed below, are based on the effective life of an
item which is defined as the period during which an item of plant can
reasonably be used for income-producing purposes.</P> 
<PRE>
<I>Effective life rates class        New rate of depreciation</I>

3 to less than 6                     40               60
5 to less than 6 2/3                 27               40

13 to less than 30                   13               20
30 and over                           7               10</PRE> 
<P>The Government introduced measures to simplify and clarify the
depreciation system, such as self-assessment provisions on items for
which the relevant rate of depreciation can be determined, broad-banding
of rates, pooling of items with similar rates and deductibility of items
$300 or less or with a life of less than three years.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Should businesses elect not to self-assess, the Commissioner of
Taxation's published `safe-harbour' rates can be adopted for
convenience.  For further information contact your local tax office.

</A></H3>
<P>The Government recognises the substantial contribution that foreign
investment can make to the development of Australia's industries and
resources.  The Government's policy is to encourage direct foreign
investment that is consistent with the interests of the Australian
community.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Certain proposals involving foreign interests need to be submitted
to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) for examination and these
are outlined in FIRB's publication <I>Australia's Foreign Investment
Policy - A Guide for Investors</I>.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Proposals for investments in hotels, motels and other tourist
facilities will generally be approved unless they are contrary to the
national interest. Proposals for investment in residential real estate
for development or under construction are normally approved, but there
are restrictions on acquisitions of established residential real estate.</P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC6">TAX CONCESSIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDIES
</A></H3>
<P>Taxpayers are allowed a deduction for capital expenditures incurred
primarily and principally in undertaking an environmental impact study.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Expenditure, other than on plant and equipment, is deductible on a
straight line basis over a period of the lesser of the life of the
project or 10 years. For this purpose, the life of the project includes
any period involving completion of the environmental impact study and
between completing the study and the expected cessation of operations. 
Where the project does not go ahead, expenditure on the environmental
impact study is deductible in the year of income in which the project is
abandoned.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The deduction is available from the year in which the expenses are
incurred and in equal instalments.  Where the environmental impact study
takes place over a number of years, expenditure in each year is eligible
for write off commencing from the year it is incurred.  Deductions are
available for offset against any income from other sources and any
resulting losses will be subject to the general carry forward and group
loss transfer provisions of the taxation law.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Deductions remain with the taxpayer who incurred the expenditure
irrespective of whether the project to which they relate is subsequently
sold:  deductions are not transferable; nor is there any clawback, where
the taxpayer sells the project in whole or in part.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Expenditure on plant and equipment used in undertaking an
environmental impact study is depreciable in accordance with the general
depreciation provisions by treating such plant and equipment as if used
for the purpose of producing assessable income.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The concession applies to expenditure incurred after 11 March 1991.</P>

<P>The Commonwealth Development Bank (CDB) provides term loans and
equipment finance for small and medium-sized businesses.  The Bank is
particularly looking to finance viable growth.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In the evaluation of applications for finance, the CDB is interested
primarily in the prospects for success, rather than the nature or extent
of available security.  This approach requires close examination of the
applicant's business strategies, management track record,
product/service strengths and weaknesses, and sales and marketing
issues.</P>
<P></P>
<P>CDB views its term loan clients as `partners' and seeks to add value
to its relationships.  There is a capacity to provide equity capital in
appropriate circumstances.</P>
<P></P>
<P>CDB is a provider of term loan finance for periods of up to 15
years.  The preferred maximum amount is $5 million and repayment

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC2">DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT -
OFFICE OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
</A></H2>
<P>The Commonwealth Government's Regional Development Strategy is an
initiative of
<I>Working Nation</I>, the Government's White Paper on Employment and
Growth, released in May 1994.  The initiatives are not specific to
tourism but will provide opportunities for tourism related projects,
planning and innovation to be integrated with broadly based regional
economic development strategies and activities directed at improving the
competitiveness of regions in international markets.</P>
<P></P>
<P>It is administered by the Office of Regional Development which
became part of the Department of Housing and Regional Development in
April 1994.  The Office is responsible for coordinating and implementing
the Government's Regional Development Strategy (RDS) and associated
programs.  The Government has earmarked some $150 million in RDS program
outlays over the four financial years to 1997-98.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Program should also provide opportunities for linking economic
initiatives in various sectors, including tourism, and support
partnership approaches with private industry and the three spheres of
government.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The RDS has two primary component programs:</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC3">REGIONAL BEST PRACTICE PROGRAM
</A></H3>
<P>The <B>Regional Best Practice Program</B> ($81.4 million over 4
years) aims to support and encourage leadership and the implementation
of regional development plans.  There are four elements of the Program:</P>
<P></P>
<UL><LI>Structures, Strategies and Projects: aims to encourage the
development of agreed vision and enabling strategies by regions; build
more effective linkages between stakeholders; and achieve best practice
approaches to regional development;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>Management and Skills Enhancement: aims to develop an information
network and advice for regional development practitioners on best
practice approaches and provide innovative opportunities for training
and skills enhancement;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>Improvements in Program Delivery: aims to develop best practice in
government to support regional development.  It will involve extending
the reach of key business improvement programs such as National
Enterprise Improvement Scheme, Austrade and innovation support schemes
to regions and, over time, ensure the better coordination of regionally
focused activities of Commonwealth departments; and</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>Partnerships: aims to establish a number of consultative forums for
elected representatives and officials of the three tiers of government
and their interaction with regional bodies and groups.</LI></UL>
<P>	
</P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC4">INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM
</A></H3>
<P>The <B>Infrastructure Program</B> aims to facilitate regional
infrastructure projects that are identified as integral to the economic
development strategy of a region and which can demonstrate commercial
and economic viability.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Individual projects funded under this component require a
contribution of up to 50 per cent from other sources.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Eligibility</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>Eligibility for assistance will vary according to the elements of
the two Programs.  The main funding recipients will be Regional Economic
Development Organisations (REDOs).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Funding may also be available for local councils and Regional
Organisation of Councils (ROCs) committed to the formation of a REDO. 
Tertiary institutions with demonstrated interest and expertise in areas
relevant to regional development may also apply for assistance. 
Interested industries and firms with regional projects or initiatives
relevant to the economic development strategy of a region should contact
the local REDO, council or ROC in the first instance.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Applications will be considered only in the context of an integrated
economic development strategy which focuses on business development and
investment from an adequately defined region with a broadly based
development body.  These bodies may include tourism representatives as
well as a range of other economic sectors and groups in the region.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Selection Criteria</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>For particulars of the selection criteria for projects under the
various elements of the Programs, contact the Office of Regional
Development on 1 800 801 957.</P>

TOURISM STRATEGY - A PROGRESS REPORT
</A></H3>
<P>As part of the Government's response to the recommendations of the
Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, provision was made
for the development, implementation and evaluation of a strategy to
strengthen tourism industry participation by Aboriginal peoples and
Torres Strait Islanders.  The Tourism Industry Advisory Committee (TIAC)
was established to further this aim.</P>
<P></P>
<P>TIAC is advising ATSIC and the Department of Tourism on the
development of a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tourism
Strategy.  TIAC's objective is to develop a draft strategy to support
increased active participation of indigenous peoples in the Australian
tourism industry and to select pilot projects which will test aspects of
the draft strategy.  The document will be presented to the Board of
Commissioners and to Government in September 1994. The Committee has
held consultative meetings in various locations to identify the major
issues to be considered when developing the final Strategy.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A major national study on indigenous involvement in the tourism
industry was commissioned by TIAC.  The consultancy covers: the
attitudes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to tourism;
industry and consumer expectations of indigenous tourism ventures;
supply of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tourism activities
(including current levels of employment); reasons for business
success/failure (enterprise analysis); and developmental needs
(including training).</P>
<P></P>
<P>An issues paper also canvassed Aboriginal peoples' and Torres Strait
Islanders' attitudes to the development of indigenous tourism
enterprises and increased employment opportunities in established
tourism operations.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Pilot projects to test elements of the draft Strategy will be
identified and financially supported during 1994-95 and 1995-96.  A
final Strategy is due to be completed by July 1997.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Tourism Information Guide</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>ATSIC has produced a <I>Tourism Information Guide</I> which

<P>The Aboriginal Reconciliation Unit is located in the Department of
Prime Minister and Cabinet and acts as Secretariat to the Council for
Aboriginal Reconciliation.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Council comprises 25 members, of whom 12 are Aboriginal and two
are Torres Strait Islanders.  The Council's task is to look for ways for
indigenous and other Australians to share Australia as equals, and to
examine opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
to control their destinies. The tourism industry offers significant
opportunities for indigenous people.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="RTFToC11">INDUSTRY COMMITTEE
</A></H3>
<P>The Industry Committee aims to enhance employment prospects for
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the private sector and
to promote productive cultural diversity in the workplace.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Committee and its agents meet with employers and union groups in
all States and Territories and at the national level.  The meeting
produces and disseminates an information package on reconciliation
targeted at employer groups and unions (see below, the `Working as One'
package).</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Committee also sponsors an award for businesses whose activities
have contributed to the reconciliation process.  In September 1993, the
award was presented to the <I>Koori Mail</I>, in recognition of the
newspaper's efforts in providing information and promoting positive
images of indigenous Australians.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Committee contributed to and participated in the First National
Indigenous Business Conference, held in Alice Springs in September 1993.
 The Conference recognised the two-fold increase in indigenous
businesses over the last five years (many of which operate in the
tourism field), as well as the contribution of indigenous businesses to
establishing an independent economic base for indigenous Australians.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Committee recognises that the tourism industry is one of
Australia's largest growth industries, and a vital economic activity for
many centres throughout Australia.  The findings of a 1992 survey of
inbound visitors revealed that more than 70 per cent of overseas
visitors wanted an indigenous Australian cultural experience.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Other initiatives of the Committee include current sponsorship of a
Cairns tourism/Queensland Confederation of Industry initiative which
will promote the involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
peoples in tourism.</P>

and is designed to encourage union and employer groups and members to
work against discrimination, and for recognition and inclusion of
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives in their workplaces.</P>
<P></P>
<P>It contains positive examples of the contributions indigenous
Australians make to business and economic development in Australia, as
employees, employers and partners.</P>
<P></P>

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC24">WORKPLACE BARGAINING
</A></H3>
<P>The Workplace Bargaining program aims to promote productive and
cooperative bargaining in Australian workplaces.  The main focus is on
funding projects which lead to Federal certified agreements, enterprise
flexibility agreements, or the use of enterprise flexibility clauses in
awards.  The results of funded projects will be publicised to
demonstrate successful processes and the benefits which can be derived
from workplace agreements.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Workplace bargaining encourages workers and managers to get together
and agree on how best to put productivity changes into place for their
particular business.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The program provides a practical starting point for enterprises
wishing to pursue workplace bargaining under the changes to Federal
industrial relations law which came into effect in March 1994.  Projects
can focus on particular issues encountered in negotiation of workplace
agreements, such as the needs of migrant workers and women.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Funding is available to groups seeking to negotiate a certified
agreement or enterprise flexibility arrangement.  Project funding is
based on competitive bids which are assessed against selection criteria.
 Some sectors of the tourism industry have already taken advantage of
the Program.</P>

</A></H1> 
<H2><A NAME="RTFToC2">BUREAU OF TOURISM RESEARCH
</A></H2>
<P>The Bureau of Tourism Research (BTR) is a professional, independent
research agency servicing the statistical and research needs of
Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, the tourism industry and
the community at large.  It is jointly funded by the Commonwealth, State
and Territory governments and exists to provide a national focus for the
collection, analysis and dissemination of tourism and related data.</P>
<P></P>
<P>BTR is responsible for two major surveys of tourism activity in
Australia:</P>
<P></P>
<P>The <B>International Visitor Survey</B> (IVS) draws on personal
interviews with 12,000 overseas visitors each year and is the most
comprehensive source of information available on the travel patterns and
characteristics of visitors to Australia; and</P>
<P></P>
<P>The <B>Domestic Tourism Monitor</B> (DTM) involves interviews with
65,000 Australians each year and provides information on travel
undertaken in Australia by these people, including day trips as well as
trips involving nights away from home.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Results of these surveys are published in both quarterly and annual
reports. Detailed analysis of the results provides the basis for other
reports and publications.  Complete survey data are available on compact
disk, and special tabulations or supplementary surveys can be produced
by BTR as required.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In addition to its survey output, BTR provides:</P>
<P></P>
<UL><LI>a telephone statistical inquiries service, covering all
aspects of tourism data;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>estimates of the economic significance of tourism;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>

<P>The CSIRO is presently conducting a formal priority-setting exercise
to identify tourism research gaps and priorities.  Discussions are under
way with industry, government and several other agencies (for example,
universities and the Cooperative Research Centres on Tropical
Rainforests and the Great Barrier Reef) with tourism research interests.
 One important feature of this priority-setting procedure is to identify
existing research efforts so that not only research gaps are identified
but the possibility of duplication of effort is reduced.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The resulting initiative will involve collaboration with the tourism
industry to identify research needs at the national strategic level
and/or to perform research for industry on a contract basis.</P>

their natural, historic or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
significance.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Register can include places ranging from archaeological sites to
areas important for their ecological values, as well as buildings or
other cultural sites.  Sites can include Aboriginal shell middens,
expanses of tropical rainforest, and buildings from our colonial past,
amongst others.</P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC6">AUSTRALIAN NATURE CONSERVATION AGENCY
</A></H2>
<P>The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service was established
in 1975 as the principal nature conservation organisation within the
Commonwealth Government.  In June 1993 its name was changed to the
Australian Nature Conservation Agency (ANCA) to reflect its wider
conservation role.  A large part of the Agency's work is done in close
cooperation with government conservation organisations in the States and
Territories.  The Australian and New Zealand Environment and
Conservation Council (ANZECC) is the formal forum where government
ministers meet to discuss national issues.  It performs a similar role
to that of the Tourism Ministers' Council.</P>
<P></P>
<P>ANCA manages five national parks (Christmas Island, Jervis Bay,
Kakadu, Norfolk Island and Uluru-Kata Tjuta), two botanic gardens (the
Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra and Norfolk Island
Botanic Gardens) and several marine reserves (Ashmore Reef,
Coringa-Herald, Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs, Lihou Reef, Mermaid Reef
and the Commonwealth waters of Ningaloo and the Solitary Islands).</P>
<P></P>
<P>In its broader conservation role, the Agency is responsible for
administering laws about wildlife protection (the import and export of
native animals, plants and products derived from them), endangered
species and whales.  It is also active in promoting community
participation and research in nature conservation outside protected
areas through programs such as Wetlands Conservations, Save the Bush,
One Billion Trees and Waterwatch.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Much of ANCA's work involves bringing together people and nature
conservation in an ecologically sustainable way.  The Agency provides
the following benefits for the tourism industry:</P>
<P></P>
<UL><LI>visitor facilities and interpretive services (guided tours,
specialist talks) in some of Australia's most naturally and culturally
significant sites;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>
<LI>help with specialist educational tours to botanic gardens and
national parks;</LI>
<LI>	</LI>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC8">GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AUTHORITY
</A></H2>
<P>In 1975 the Australian Government acted to establish a system which
amounts to self regulation of the Great Barrier Reef by the people who
use and depend on it, by creating the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
Authority (GBRMPA).</P>
<P></P>
<P>With its main office in Townsville Queensland, GBRMPA is responsible
for the care and development of the world's largest multiple use marine
park to provide for the wise use, understanding and enjoyment of the
Great Barrier Reef in perpetuity.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The functions of GBRMPA are: planning and management of the Marine
Park, implementing zoning plans and strategies through enforcement and
the assessment of environmental impacts of use and development;
undertaking research and monitoring to improve the knowledge and
understanding of the Great Barrier Reef; providing education and advice
to users of the Marine Park; coordinating Commonwealth and State
government policies as they apply to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
and the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area; and the operation of the
Great Barrier Reef Aquarium.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Assistance Measures</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>Tourism is a significant use of the Marine Park and GBRMPA can
provide regulatory and technical assistance, management and educational
advice to the tourism industry for activities and development within the
Marine Park.  GBRMPA assists ongoing tourism in the Great Barrier Reef
Marine Park by ensuring that all approved use is sustainable.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Eligibility/Criteria</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>There are no specific eligibility criteria.  Most commercial tourist
operations and developments within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
require an assessment of their environmental impact and a Marine Parks
Permit. Prospective tourist developers and operators with proposals
within or adjacent to the Marine Park can contact GBRMPA for information
on zoning, environmental impact assessment, and permit requirements.</P>

<H2><A NAME="RTFToC9">WET TROPICS MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY
</A></H2>
<P>The Wet Tropics Management Authority was formed through an agreement
on 10 March 1990 between the Prime Minister and the Premier of
Queensland to jointly fund the Authority as manager of the Wet Tropics
of Queensland World Heritage Area.  The primary goal of the Authority is
to `provide for the implementation of Australia's international duty for
the protection, conservation, presentation, rehabilitation and
transmission to future generations of the Wet Tropics of Queensland
World Heritage Area, within the meaning of the World Heritage
Convention'.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Assistance Measures</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>The Wet Tropics Management Authority confers with developers,
potential developers and land owners regarding developments in or
adjacent to the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area.  The desired approach
is to develop cooperative management agreements which seek to achieve
the primary goal for the Wet Tropics.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Wet Tropics Management Authority is developing visitor centres
in north Queensland which promote the values of the Wet Tropics World
Heritage Area. The preferred approach to development is through joint
ventures with community groups, private enterprise and other government
agencies.  Guidelines for the development of visitor centres are
available from the Authority's community relations program.</P>

SRC="leaficon.GIF"></CENTER><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Current industry 
practices in energy and waste minimisation</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ecotourism and nature-based tourism operators are 
genuinely concerned about the impact of their activities on Australia's 
natural and cultural environments. At the same 
time, there is a growing awareness that generating waste and consuming 
energy amount to significant business costs.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">There are many examples of environmental best practice 
and innovation within the ecotourism industry and operators are 
interested in sharing their experiences and successes in this area. 
However, there is considerable scope for the industry to embrace an 
increasing range of new practices and technologies in energy and waste 
minimisation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In November 1994, the Commonwealth Department of Tourism 
commissioned the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) to carry out a 
study to investigate cost-effective 
energy and waste minimisation practices relevant to ecotourism and 
nature-based tourism operators. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The research findings on current industry practices 
quoted in this guide were established through an extensive research and 
consultation process undertaken by the ACF, and included:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> a national and international literature review of energy and waste 
minimisation practices in the tourism and hospitality sectors;<P>


<LI> wide distribution of a newsletter and written survey to tourism 
operators, industry associations, government agencies, and energy and 
waste management bodies inviting input to the guide;<P>


<LI> an in-depth telephone survey of 110 nature-based tourism operators; 
and<P>


<LI> a series of visits to nature-based tourism sites in most States and 
Territories and face to face interviews with operators.
</UL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Achieving best practice in energy and waste minimisation 
(whether ecotourism or mainstream 
tourism) can often be a complex and time consuming process. This guide 
has been produced 
to help simplify this process by providing practical information and 
advice to assist operators in meeting their environmental and business 
objectives.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Current waste minimisation 
practices</B></FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Waste minimisation has received considerable attention 
from ecotourism and nature-based 
tourism operators. Some examples of successful waste minimisation 
practices include: 
using income generated by an in-house bottle recycling program for a 
local area interpretation project, using reusable plastic containers and 
utensils on tours, and 
reusing grey water to irrigate a rainforest reforestation project. 
<IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Fig1.jpg"><BR 
CLEAR=ALL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Research for this guide, in particular a survey of 110 
operators, showed that recycling 
and re-use tend to be well understood and well supported by operators as 
shown in 
figure 1. The survey also showed that:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> 83 per cent of operators preferred purchased goods made from 
recycled materials, goods with minimal packaging or goods that can be 
readily re-used or recycled. Of these operators, 87 per cent were 
prepared to pay extra for such goods;
<LI> reducing environmental impact was seen as the main benefit of a 
waste minimisation program followed by enhancing operator reputation;<P>


<LI> the main method of sewage disposal for tour operators was provided 
facilities such as in national parks;<P>


<LI> septic facilities were the main method of sewage disposal by 
accommodation operators;<P>


<LI> the two main methods of solid waste management for tour operators 
were removal from site and municipal garbage facilities;<P>


<LI> 44 per cent of accommodation operators took steps to minimise the 
impact of stormwater run-off;<P>


<LI> glass and aluminium were the materials most recycled by tour 
operators; and<P>


<LI> composting, removal from site, municipal recycling and on-site 
recycling were found to be the main methods of solid waste management in 
accommodation facilities.
</UL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ecotourism and nature-based tourism operators are heavily 
dependent on public infrastructure 
such as visitor centres, toilets, cooking facilities and shelters in 
parks, recycling 
programs and waste disposal facilities. Where these are lacking, 
particularly infrastructure for recycling, operators find it more 
difficult to achieve high standards 
of environmental performance. In addition, many ecotourism operators are 
dependent 
on mainstream tourism operators for support services including transport, 
accommodation and catering. Where the operations of these services are 
inconsistent with those 
of ecotourism operators, the credibility of the overall service can be 
undermined.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Current energy minimisation 
practices</B></FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Overall, energy consumption is not given as much 
attention as waste minimisation by 
the Australian ecotourism industry. Nevertheless, a number of operators 
are achieving 
results in energy minimisation. Examples include:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> eliminating noise pollution from generators and saving on running 
costs by using solar powered refrigeration in safari trailers;<P>


<LI> using two-wheel drive vehicles (instead of 4WD) and matching vehicle 
capacity to the size of tour groups. This practice contributes to fuel 
economy; and<P>


<LI> running an office in a remote location on solar and water energy 
with the benefit of no electricity bills.
</UL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The majority of ecotourism operators use fuel economy 
information when purchasing vehicles and over half regularly train staff 
in energy-efficient driving, equipment 
operation and building management. For tour operators, the main form of 
energy used is diesel fuel (32 per cent), followed by LPG and petrol.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most accommodation facilities are connected to the 
electricity grid, but some use independent power supply systems that rely 
on expensive and inefficient diesel power 
generation. Very few facilities appear to use renewable energy sources. 
This can be attributed to a number of factors such as lack of capital to 
invest in what are seen as low priority aspects of developments and lack 
of institutional support such as advice, financing and maintenance. Also, 
many accommodation facilities have built-in design problems that cannot 
be fixed without significant capital expenditure.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Towards best practice in energy<BR> and waste 
minimisation</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Improving environmental performance does not have to 
increase costs or reduce comfort and convenience. As better environmental 
practices are being sought, more solutions 
which enable environmental, financial and client service goals to be met 
simultaneously are being found. For example, good, passive solar building 
design reduces the financial 
and environmental costs of heating buildings while improving client 
comfort. Not changing towels or bed linen daily unless clients request it 
lowers cleaning costs and reduces environmental impact as well as extends 
the lives of these items (generating further financial and environmental 
savings).
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Simple solutions may not always be available, however, 
and choices may need to be made on the basis of which goal(s) is seen as 
more important in a particular circumstance. 
For example, more expensive waste treatment methods may be needed where 
environmental sensitivity precludes off-site discharge. But even here, 
additional benefits may exist or can be developed. Protecting the 
environment enhances the tourism product, and responsible actions of 
tourism operators are positive, marketable commodities. Indeed, many 
ecotourism operators recognise this and regard improving their 
reputations 
as a major benefit of a waste minimisation program, as shown in figure 
2.<P>
<IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4 ALIGN=LEFT SRC="Fig2.jpg"><BR 
CLEAR=ALL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Energy and waste minimisation practices can be used as 
business assets by:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> including them in promotional literature and other advertising;<P>


<LI> using them as a basis for magazine stories or articles in local 
papers and among printed tour guides;<P>


<LI> preparing and displaying information about them as part of an 
educational program;<P>


<LI> organising tours or talks about energy and waste issues or including 
them where appropriate, in existing tour programs; and<P>


<LI> offering clients rewards or discounts for good practices such as 
travelling by public transport, participating in recycling, or consuming 
the least amount of energy or 
water.
</UL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">As tourism operators move towards best practice, they are 
sometimes concerned that they will disappoint clients who want maximum 
convenience, or who feel their holiday 
mood may be spoiled by reminders of their individual environmental 
responsibility. This is a legitimate concern as some good environmental 
practices may require changes in 
behaviour, however, such concern is easily overstated. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most people seeking ecotourism experiences are likely to 
respond positively to well communicated, environmentally responsible 
practices--indeed, they often expect operators to perform to high 
environmental standards.
<P>
Caption: Attractively presented recycling programs <BR>
are likely to be well received by visitors.
<IMG VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 BORDER=4  SRC="Pics/Boxes1.jpg">
<P ALIGN="LEFT">There are a number of strategies which can help to ensure 
positive responses to energy and waste minimisation practices by clients. 
Among these are:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> ensuring potential clients are informed about environmental 
practices and explaining why they are being used;<P>


<LI> providing explanatory material on why specific environmental 
practices have been adopted and how they reduce environmental impacts;<P>



<LI> offering options for those who prefer more conventional practices. 
For example, if a shampoo dispenser is installed, also provide small 
containers of shampoo, along 
 with an explanation of the environmental benefits of using the 
dispenser;<P>


<LI> ensuring that environmentally-preferable equipment works well. For 
example, the quality of showers provided by water-efficient showerheads 
varies greatly, so careful selection is critical;<P>


<LI>seeking options for environmentally constructive trade-offs. For 
example, using solar water heating and collecting rainwater may balance 
the installation of a spa bath;<P>


<LI> providing feedback on performance, including comparisons of current 
performance against previous performance, so clients feel a sense of 
achievement and participation; and<P>


<LI> focusing on practices which deliver significant environmental 
benefits. It is better to get a few big things right than to become 
bogged down in many minor issues. Proper monitoring of performance will 
help focus on major issues.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5><B>Assessing costs and benefits of <BR>energy and 
waste minimisation</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">There seems to be a common belief that adopting best 
practice in energy and waste 
minimisation will add to costs, particularly capital costs. This is 
usually not the 
case, though where it is, a trade-off can be made between environmental 
and financial 
goals. In such circumstances, it may be useful to classify elements of an 
operation as 
essentials, assets or costs. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Essentials:</B> 
Where certain energy and waste minimisation practices are essential, the 
challenge 
is to implement them as cost-effectively as possible. For example, a 
facility near 
a national park must ensure that its wastes do not affect the park's 
ecosystems. 
Economical options to meet that goal could include, for example, sharing 
the facility with 
other nearby operations.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Assets:</B> 
Good energy and waste minimisation practices are typically potential 
assets, they 
can add perceived value to the service offered, and thereby add to income 
and profitability. 
In this case, promoting the practices is as important as implementing 
them cost-effectively. For example, the opportunity to stay in 
super-energy-efficient, accommodation 
unit which offers superb comfort is attractive to the environmentally 
conscious traveller. 
Promoted effectively this can be quite profitable.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Costs:</B> 
Even where a good practice is seen as a cost, it is worth asking if it 
can be converted 
into an asset. What at first appears to be a cost may be revealed as a 
benefit if 
a more comprehensive assessment is carried out. For example, effective 
insulation 
and energy-efficient building design can cut the capital cost of 
heating/cooling equipment 
and energy supply infrastructure, as well as reduce ongoing operating 
costs and improve 
client satisfaction. Even where initial capital costs are increased, 
savings in ongoing operational costs often offer net financial benefits.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Additional financial benefits can often be gained. For 
example, the value of many 
businesses is calculated as a multiple of their profitability. If energy 
savings 
can improve profits, they also increase the value of the business.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Comprehensive cost-benefit 
analysis</B></FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">A cost-benefit analysis should include all costs and 
benefits over the life of an 
operation. Usually many costs and benefits are ignored in the 
cost-benefit sum, especially 
environmental costs and benefits. To use economists' jargon, these costs 
and benefits are 'externalised'. This can have serious consequences both 
financial and environmental. 
One example is the massive costs associated with the clean-up of many 
contaminated 
sites, resulting from past failures to incorporate the cost of properly 
managing 
and disposing of hazardous materials.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Some of the approaches used for cost-benefit analyses are 
outlined below.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Does it seem like a good idea and can I afford it? 
</B>
Many people carry in their heads a set of unconscious purchasing 
criteria. In small 
businesses, a subjective judgment will often be made based on personal 
beliefs about 
the benefits and the availability of funds. While environmental values 
may be taken 
into account, a lack of clearly articulated criteria often leads to 
decisions which add 
to costs and cause undue environmental impacts. For example, installing 
an energy-efficient 
heating/cooling system in a poorly-insulated building can add to costs 
without minimising environmental impact.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Purchase cost comparison:</B>
 A common way of comparing costs is to consider only purchase price. This 
concern 
about the upfront costs is often exacerbated by limited capital and the 
need for 
vigilance over cashflow. This approach can damage a business as it 
ignores ongoing 
operating costs, future replacement costs, quality of service and 
environmental impacts. It 
should not be used.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ongoing financial costs and environmental impacts should 
be used as much as possible, 
and compensating benefits will often be revealed. Doing this is not 
always easy, 
but methods for carrying it out are gradually becoming simpler and more 
widely available.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Payback period comparison:</B> 
In a payback period comparison, the time it takes to repay the extra 
capital cost 
of the additional feature is calculated. For example, the payback period 
for a solar 
water heater may vary from three to fifteen years, depending on location 
and fuel 
cost. This is a very pessimistic comparison method, as it focuses on the 
direct financial 
payback and tends to ignore the broader savings and benefits. Moreover, 
it looks 
at options as costs to be repaid rather than as investments on which 
returns are 
to be gained.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Many aspects of ecotourism operations, if subjected to a 
narrow application of this 
test, would not be adopted. Applying payback period comparisons to 
investments in 
environmental goods shows that those investments are seen as marginal 
activities 
rather than as fundamentals of the business.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><B>Lifecycle cost comparison:</B> 
This approach, estimates the total whole of life costs and benefits of 
each option. 
The level of sophistication used can vary markedly. This approach is in 
the right 
direction as it encourages consideration of costs and benefits in a 
broader context. 
Two examples involving choices of lights and photocopiers illustrate this 
approach.
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> A compact fluorescent lamp may cost $25 and use $25 worth of 
electricity over its 8000 hour life. In comparison, the eight 
incandescent globes it replaces (because they have shorter lives) cost 
around $8, but use $100 of electricity. Other costs include the cost of 
labour for replacing globes (eight times more often for the 
incandescents), and the inconvenience and client complaints if globes 
fail more often.<P>


<LI> Photocopiers use large amounts of electricity and paper, some 
copiers use $2000 worth of electricity and $20 000 worth of paper (5 
tonnes) over their lives. Selecting 
 an energy-efficient copier with double-sided copying and reduction 
capabilities, learning to use these features efficiently, using recycled 
paper and copying on to the back 
 of non-essential, printed-on-one-side paper can save thousands of 
dollars while dramatically reducing environmental impacts.
</UL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Guidelines for making calculations of lifecycle costs are 
published in many sources, 
including the Department of Primary Industries and Energy's 1994 
publication, <CITE>Financial Evaluation of Energy Management 
Measures.</CITE>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Energy can be used more or less efficiently. With greater 
efficiency, the same task 
can be done with less energy, less environmental impact and less money. 
However, 
energy cannot be re-used or recycled--the same fire cannot provide heat 
several times 
over.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A waste is a material which has, or is believed to have, 
no further use. While much 
effort is now directed at using materials more efficiently and at 
recovering materials 
from what were previously regarded as waste streams, the waste 
minimisation and materials recovery industry will still take some time 
before it matches the scale and sophistication 
of the energy minimisation industry.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">A familiar concept is the waste management hierarchy 
comprising the four Rs of reduce, 
re-use, recycle and (energy) recovery, to which, for the sake of 
completeness, a 
T for treatment should be added. It is useful to think of a similar, but 
shorter 
hierarchy for energy management, as shown in figure 3. Where practical, 
preference should 
be given to management techniques that are higher up the hierarchies.<P>

<P>
Reducing both energy and materials consumption can be achieved by 
increasing efficiency 
(doing more with less) or by doing less. In some circumstances, doing 
less will be 
an important part of the experience being sought by clients. Re-use and 
recycling 
of materials are well accepted and useful waste minimisation strategies 
often bring financial 
benefits.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The energy efficiency of some processes can be increased 
by using waste heat. For 
example, waste heat from refrigeration or air conditioning equipment may 
be used 
to heat water. Concerns about emissions from burning some wastes or in 
some locations 
may mean that recovering of energy from the burning of wastes is not an 
option. In such circumstances, 
disposal may need to be carried out, following treatment to reduce the 
risk of environmental 
impact. However, waste disposal should always be regarded as a failure to 
find an environmentally sound use for a particular resource.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Renewable energy sources are diverse, and the 
technologies for their cost-effective 
application are improving rapidly.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Non-renewable (fossil) energy sources must be assessed 
both for their local effects 
(for example, impact of accessing fuel, air pollution) and their 
contribution to 
global warming.

<FONT SIZE=4><B>Setting up</B></FONT> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">The biggest opportunities to save energy usually occur 
during the design, construction, 
refurbishment and replacement stages. The decisions taken at these stages 
can lock 
in long-term energy efficiency or inefficiency and influence the 
environmental impact of energy use for many years. It is, therefore, 
critical to seek quality advice at 
these times. This guide provides some advice and contacts where more 
detailed information 
can be sought.

designed to make the most of natural breezes and shade from surrounding 
trees.

<P ALIGN="LEFT">When consultants and advisors are used to design and 
specify buildings and infrastructure, 
clear guidelines on energy objectives must be provided. Arrangements 
should be made 
to ensure that consultants account for energy performance outcomes, and 
financial incentives might be established for exceeding benchmarked 
performance. Clear guidelines 
should be provided on how cost comparisons (for example, use of lifecycle 
analysis) 
are to be carried out. Consultants should be encouraged to share 
information where 
it might reduce overall costs. For example, a heating specialist could 
identify the 
major heat loss areas of a building so that an architect could modify the 
building 
design to reduce the capacity and capital cost of the heating system.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Often, a team approach is not followed in design and 
construction projects. Professional 
inputs are often passed along a linear chain and are not subject to close 
questioning 
or the exchange of professional knowledge. This is not good practice, let 
alone best practice, as the results often show.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Many contracts simply pay consultants a percentage of the 
project budget. This may 
not encourage energy efficient, environmentally sound or low-cost design. 

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Purchasing</B></FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Just as the design of a building locks in energy use, the 
type of equipment purchased 
locks in energy use for many years. Lifecycle estimates of costs and 
benefits, including 
environmental impacts, should be considered in selecting new appliances 
and equipment.
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Existing operations</B></FONT>

<P ALIGN="LEFT">In almost all existing facilities and operations, there 
is potential for substantial 
energy savings. To start, it makes sense to conduct an evaluation of 
existing energy 
use to identify major components. While an energy auditor can be engaged 
to do this, 
a lot can be achieved by operators and staff. Indeed, because operators 
and staff can 
monitor changes in energy use over time, and in response to the 
modification of equipment 
or behaviour, they can often achieve large savings by relying on their 
experience. Effectively involving staff is good for morale, improves 
implementation and creates 
opportunities for staff to educate and inform clients.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">It is essential that the energy data collected are 
regularly reported to management 
in simplified, summary form. Reports should be accompanied by 
explanations of trends, 
information on progress in implementing changes and proposals for further 
action.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The following actions will help identify inefficient use 
of energy and opportunities 
for improvement:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI> collect data from past energy and fuel bills and graph them to 
identify seasonal trends, sharp changes (possibly related to the 
construction of additional facilities or installation of new equipment) 
and other variations;<P>


<LI> train staff to read electricity and gas meters, and then read the 
meters at intervals to determine which activities consume the most 
energy. For example, comparing energy use at low occupancy with that at 
high occupancy indicates the scale of energy overheads which are a 
financial and environmental drain even when no clients are present. 
Comparing rates of energy use overnight and at different times of the day 
can help identify the amount of energy used in cooking, lighting, etc. 
Comparing energy use when certain equipment has been switched off or left 
on can help identify sources of inefficiency;<P>


<LI>calculate energy use per guest-night, passenger-kilometre or other 
relevant criterion and report on this at regular intervals. Results can 
be incorporated into educational materials for clients; and<P>


<LI> build up an inventory of energy-using equipment and estimates or 
measurements of its energy consumption, so that informed decisions can be 
made when vehicles or equipment are replaced, buildings refurbished or 
facilities extended.

CLEAR=ALL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE=7>T</FONT>his section provides practical 
information on how to minimise waste and energy use 
in most activities associated with fixed facilities and tour operations. 
The Reference 
Sheets should be used in conjunction with the techniques described in 
section 1 of 
this guide, which provides a framework for action. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Most of the suggestions provided here are associated with 
fixed facilities. The main 
reasons for this are:
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>fixed facilities are, generally, much larger and more complex systems 
than transport 
vehicles. As a result, their potential environmental impacts are likely 
to be greater, 
as is the number of actions available to minimise waste and energy 
use;<P>
<LI> fixed facilities offer more readily available energy and material 
inputs and waste 
treatment/disposal facilities. Generally there is a separation between 
where actions 
(consumption and disposal) are carried out and where environmental 
impacts occur 
(out of sight). Fixed facilities also have more complex, 
highly-engineered systems for supply 
and removal; consequently, users of these facilities can often assume 
that minimising 
waste and reducing energy consumption is someone else's responsibility.
</UL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">While much of the information and many of the suggestions 
that follow relate to the 
design and operation of fixed facilities, they should not be seen as 
being relevant 
only to facility operators. Many tour operators use a range of fixed 
facilities as 
an essential part of their tours. If these facilities are not using 
energy efficiently 
and are not disposing of waste in an environmentally safe manner they are 
likely 
to affect the reputation of any tour which uses them. 
<P ALIGN="LEFT">Ecotourism operators should consider the energy and waste 
minimisation practices of 
any facility he or she uses. Both tour operators and accommodation 
providers should 
select the services they use on the basis of energy efficiency and waste 
minimisation 
practices.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">In many of the publications reviewed for this guide, 
waste and energy minimisation 
tended to be treated separately. For example, in selecting a preferred 
option for 
hand drying in communal toilets a primary emphasis on waste management 
led some guides 
to strongly advocate electric dryers in preference to paper or cloth 
towels, while others, 
focussing on energy minimisation, selected paper or cloth towels. Where 
possible, 
an integrated approach has been taken in preparing the Reference Sheets.
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The individual Reference Sheets focus on the tasks 
involved in supplying services 
in a tourism operation and explore how these might be performed in ways 
that minimise 
energy and waste. Focusing on these tasks rather than viewing energy and 
waste minimisation as ends in themselves was considered to be the best 
means of pursuing an integrated 
approach to the issues. This approach also allows consideration of a 
business' operational 
requirements and the likely impact of energy and waste minimisation 
practices on guests and the quality of their tourism experience.

guest and increased its business by extending tour duration. According to 
a staff 
member, 'By making tours of a least a few days, we can reduce the energy 
cost per 
day. It also means people get to relax more and absorb more, rather than 
rushing from place 
to place.'
<P ALIGN="LEFT">The Department of Conservation and Land Management in the 
Kimberley region of Western 
Australia has reduced transport fuel use in the Windjari Gorge Park and 
several other 
areas during the wet season by making these areas self-maintaining. 
Rubbish bins 
have been removed and visitors now take out their own rubbish, so rangers 
no longer need 
to collect and dispose of the rubbish.

and cycling. This avoids 
the use of a bus and the incumbent cost and fuel consumption.
