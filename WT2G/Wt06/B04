<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.

<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]
comments:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very
high quality.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and

<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed

<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework

<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in

(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995

<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.

<P><B> Forward Programme

<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval

<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive

<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried
out in the period from 1994 to 2000. Subsequently, an underground laboratory is
planned for one site to provide sufficient geological data to allow an
application for a repository construction licence.

<TD>Comprehensive detailed surface-based characterisation began at Yucca
Mountain in Nevada in 1991 following its designation in 1987 by Federal statute
as the candidate repository site. Construction of an underground laboratory
commenced in 1993. It is planned that this will lead to a decision on an
application for a licence in 2001 and, if this is approved, repository
construction would start in 2004, 13 years after the commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;

<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth

propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD WIDTH="480">Three potential sites are being investigated for a deep
repository. Detailed surface-based characterisation began in 1994 and, by way of
example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to
construct a repository which could be operational by 2008.

<TD>Spain</TD>
<TD>Choice of a site for detailed characterisation is planned for the year

<TR>
<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<TD>Switzerland</TD>
<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried

</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing

of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.

<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]
comments:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very
high quality.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>

<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with

<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.

<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out. 
</P>
<P>3.6 As a context for their evidence remaining sections of this Proof of
Evidence present the following information:

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>

White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in

(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307].

radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

Evidence present the following information:

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]
comments:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very
high quality.</I>&quot;

<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all

<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to

The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.

<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site

Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation

allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will

respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body

</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed

<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in

(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995

<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;

<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.

<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>

<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to
construct a repository which could be operational by 2008.

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination

</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:

<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.)

<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of

<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

Evidence present the following information:

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   - relating the pattern of conductive features to the overall fracture
geometry;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - establishing the seismic properties of the rocks in relation to
other physical properties and to conductivity, in order to provide a basis for
interpretation of seismic results outwith the area of the RCF;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting direct measurements of rock stress to be made and
relating it to fracture apertures and flow;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be
undertaken for palaeohydrogeological investigations;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]
comments:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland

<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and

ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to

status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the

<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site

allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means.

<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="96">Belgium</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">It is planned that a repository for high-level waste will be
located in the Boom clay and an underground laboratory in that formation at Mol&#173;Dessel
has been in operation since 1983. Detailed studies for a deep repository are
planned to commence in 2015 with repository construction around five years
later. 
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="96">Canada</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">Detailed site characterisation at the lead candidate site (yet
to be chosen) is planned to take 12 years, followed by a stage of underground
investigations complemented by further surface investigations taking a further
seven years. A decision to apply for regulatory approval for repository
construction would follow that stage of underground investigation.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="96">Finland</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">Detailed characterisation of three candidate sites commenced in
1993 following preliminary investigations at five sites. A decision to select
one site for a stage of underground investigations is planned for the year 2000,
eight years after the commencement of detailed site characterisation. An
underground laboratory is planned to operate over a seven year period between
2003 and 2010 leading to a decision on whether to apply for a construction
licence for the repository in 2010, 18 years after commencement of detailed site
characterisation.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="96">France</TD>
<TD WIDTH="480">Three potential sites are being investigated for a deep
repository. Detailed surface-based characterisation began in 1994 and, by way of
example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed
site characterisation.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be
undertaken commenced in 1986, some seven years after commencement of detailed
site investigation. If suitability of the site is confirmed, it is planned to
construct a repository which could be operational by 2008.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Spain</TD>
<TD>Choice of a site for detailed characterisation is planned for the year
2000. It is then planned that a 15 year programme, comprising surface-based
investigations followed by a rock characterisation facility, will be carried out
prior to decisions on repository construction.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground
data collection would continue during the repository construction phase leading
to a final safety report.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>Switzerland</TD>
<TD>Detailed characterisation of two potential sites is planned to be carried
out in the period from 1994 to 2000. Subsequently, an underground laboratory is
planned for one site to provide sufficient geological data to allow an
application for a repository construction licence.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>USA</TD>
<TD>Comprehensive detailed surface-based characterisation began at Yucca
Mountain in Nevada in 1991 following its designation in 1987 by Federal statute
as the candidate repository site. Construction of an underground laboratory
commenced in 1993. It is planned that this will lead to a decision on an
application for a licence in 2001 and, if this is approved, repository
construction would start in 2004, 13 years after the commencement of detailed
site characterisation.
