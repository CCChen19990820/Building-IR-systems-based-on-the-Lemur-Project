<H3>The Problem-Solving Habit</H3>                    

<P>Teenagers can get used to sizing up a problem and coming up with
common-sense ways to solve it.  Here's a six-step method that works
and can be done easily at home by parent and child.</P>

<H4>Step 1: What Is the Problem?</H4>

<P>This is a first, often overlooked, step in problem solving.  You
have to be able to state the problem and, if there's a conflict,
the opposing views.  For example: For a teen, it might be whether
to go to a certain party; for a parent, whether to ask for a raise.</P>

<H4>Step 2: What Can Be Done About It?</H4>

<P>This is when you come up with a variety of solutions.  Brainstorm
as many solutions as possible without judging which ones are better
than others.  Just keep the ideas coming.</P>

<H4>Step 3: What Are the Good and Bad Points of These Solutions?</H4>

<P>This is when you judge the different solutions.  What are the pros
and cons of each one?  You're making judgments, assessing the
possible solutions in light of your experience and the way the
world works.  And in this process you may well come up with a new
and better solution than any you originally thought of.</P>

 <H4>Step 4: Making the Decision
</H4>

<P>This is the moment you choose a solution to try.  Pick one or
perhaps two based on the decisions made in Step 3.  Talk about why
you selected these solutions.</P>

<H4>Step 5: Putting the Decision Into Action</H4>

<P>Now you put your decision to the test.  In advance, talk about what
will happen and what might be expected.  What obstacles can you
anticipate?  What helps can you expect?  How can traps be avoided
by building on the helps?</P>

                   <H4>Step 6: How Did It Go?</H4>

<P>This is the follow up, the evaluation of your solution.  How did it
work?  What changes must be made in it so that it will work better?
What would you try next time?  It's possible that a decision that
sounded good will not work as well in real life.  Overall, there is
a greater chance for success when decisions and solutions are
selected in this way.</P>

<P>After going through the process with one problem, ask your teenager
to try another.  Review the six steps so that everyone will be able
to keep on using them afterward.  The goal is to help teens get
into the habit of this kind of problems solving.</P>

<P>Just in case you don't have enough problems of your own to solve,
here are a few you can use to practice the problem-solving method:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>Who gets to use the car?
     	<LI>Why is it bad to smoke?
     	<LI>When does the garbage get taken out?
     	<LI>What happens when I go for a few days with little sleep?
     	<LI>How much TV are we going to watch?
     	<LI>How much money do I need this week?
     	<LI>Can I buy that new pair of jeans?
     	<LI>Whose turn is it to go grocery shopping?
     	<LI>Who has to baby sit the younger kids?
     	<LI>When is a good time to visit grandma?
     	<LI>What happens when I take a test without studying for it?
     	<LI>Why can't I go to that after-school party?<BR><BR>

<H3>Feelings Are Important: Getting Control of Our Emotions</H3>       

<P>Here's a KNOW YOURSELF activity: Think together, for example, about
what makes people angry.  Everyone gets angry for different
reasons.  Some people get angry when others take something from
them; others get angry when people don't listen.</P>

<P>Ask yourselves: What do we do when we get angry?  Some people try
to cool off before they speak.  Other start fights.  Some people
scream.  Some people don't say anything.  What do you do?</P>

<P>Caring about other is another area teens can often use help with.
Talk together about the problems of being a parent, the problems of
being a student.  Think about a time when you disagreed with each
other.  Exchange places; the parent is the youngster, the youngster
the parent.  Afterward, talk about whether you understand each other better
now?    </P>

<P>Sometimes it's easy to forget about the important role that
families play in children's education -- especially as children
become teenagers.  Parent involvement in student schooling usually
declines dramatically as children reach the teen years. 
Adolescents are baffling -- because they are simultaneously grownup
and not grownup.</P>

<P>What continues to be clear is that adolescents need adult guidance.
Teens need to know that their parents care about them.  The
activities that follow help parents and teens talk together to
solve problems they both care about.</P>

<P>The future is never a "sure thing."  What is sure is that there
will always be problems, and students need the ability to tackle
them.  Teenagers need to learn how to make adult decisions -- to
decide about careers, to make personal value judgments, to learn
how to get along at work and to manage households.</P>

<P>These are problem-solving activities designed by the Home and
School Institute.  They are designed to help parents build their
teenagers' problem-solving skills.  To learn these skills, students
need practice -- practice they can get at home.</P>

<P>Think of these as starter activities to get your ideas going. 
There are opportunities everywhere for teaching and learning.</P>

<P>There is perhaps no situation more frustrating for parents 
or teachers than living or working with children who do not 
perform as well academically as their potential indicates 
they can.  These children are labeled as underachievers, 
yet few people agree on exactly what this term means.  At 
what point does underachievement end and achievement begin?  
Is a gifted student who is failing mathematics while doing 
superior work in reading an underachiever?  Does 
underachievement occur suddenly, or is it 
better defined as a series of poor performances over an extended time period?  Certainly, the phenomenon of underachievement is as complex and multifaceted as the 
children to whom this label has been applied.</P>

<a name="Definition"></a>
<H3>Definition of Underachievement
</H3>

<P>Early researchers (Raph, Goldberg, and Passow, 1966) 
and some recent authors (Davis and Rimm, 1989) have defined underachievement in terms of a discrepancy between a child's school performance and some ability index 
such as an IQ score.  These definitions, although seemingly 
clear and succinct, provide little insight to parents and 
teachers who wish to address this problem with individual 
students.  A better way to define underachievement is to 
consider the various components.</P>

<P>Underachievement, first and foremost, is a behavior and as 
such, it can change over time.  Often, underachievement is 
seen as a problem of attitude or work habits.  However, neither habits nor attitude can be modified as directly as behaviors.  Thus, referring to "underachieving behaviors" 
pinpoints those aspects of children's lives which they are 
most able to alter.</P>

<P>Underachievement is content and situation specific.  Gifted 
children who do not succeed in school are often successful in outside activities such as sports, social occasions, 
and after-school jobs.  Even a child who does poorly in 
most school subjects may display a talent or interest in at 
least one school subject.  Thus, labeling a child as an 
"underachiever" disregards any positive outcomes or behaviors that child displays.  It is better to label the behaviors 
than the child (e.g., the child is "underachieving in math 
and language arts" rather than an "underachieving student").</P>

<P>Underachievement is in the eyes of the beholder.  For 
some students (and teachers and parents), as long as a 
passing grade is attained, there is no underachievement.  
"After all," this group would say, "A C is an average grade."  
To others, a grade of B+ could constitute underachievement if the student in question were expected to get an A.  
Recognizing the idiosyncratic nature of what constitutes 
success and failure is the first step toward understanding 
underachieving behaviors in students.</P>

<P>Underachievement is tied intimately to self-concept development.  Children who learn to see themselves in terms of 
failure eventually begin to place self-imposed limits of what 
is possible.  Any academic successes are written off as 
"flukes," while low grades serve to reinforce negative self-
perceptions.  This self-deprecating attitude often results in 
comments such as "Why should I even try?  I'm just going 
to fail anyway.", or "Even if I do succeed, people will say it's 
because I cheated."  The end product is a low self-concept, with students perceiving themselves as weak in academics.  Under this assumption, their initiative to change or 
to accept a challenge is limited.</P>

<a name="Strategies"></a>
<H3>Strategies To Reverse Patterns of Underachievement</H3>

<P>Luckily, it is easier to reverse patterns of underachieving 
behavior than it is to define the term underachievement.</P>

<P>        Whitmore (1980) describes three types of strategies 
that she found effective in working with underachieving 
behaviors in students:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Supportive Strategies</B>.  Classroom techniques and designs that allow students to feel they are part of a "family," 
versus a "factory," include methods such as holding class 
meetings to discuss student concerns; designing curriculum activities based on the needs and interests of the children; and allowing students to bypass assignments on 
subjects in which they have previously shown competency.<BR><BR>

<LI><B>Intrinsic Strategies</B>.  These strategies incorporate the idea 
that students' self-concepts as learners are tied closely to 
their desire to achieve academically (Purkey and Novak, 
1984).  Thus, a classroom that invites positive attitudes is 
likely to encourage achievement.  In classrooms of this 
type, teachers encourage attempts, not just successes; 
they value student input in creating classroom rules and 
responsibilities; and they allow students to evaluate their 
own work before receiving a grade from the teacher.<BR><BR>

<LI><B>Remedial Strategies</B>.  Teachers who are effective in reversing underachieving behaviors recognize that students are 
not perfect - that each child has specific strengths and 
weaknesses as well as social, emotional and intellectual 
needs.  With remedial strategies, students are given 
chances to excel in their areas of strength and interest 
while opportunities are provided in specific areas of learning deficiencies.  This remediation is done in a "safe environment in which mistakes are considered a part of learning for everyone, including the teacher.<BR><BR>
</UL>

The key to eventual success lies in the willingness of parents and teachers to encourage students whenever their 
performance or attitude shifts (even slightly) in a positive direction.<BR><BR>

<a name="Participation"></a>
<H3>Participation in Gifted Programs</H3>

<P>Students who underachieve in some aspect of school performance, but whose talents exceed the bounds of what is 
generally covered in the standard curriculum, have a right 
to an education that matches their potential.  To be sure, a 
program for gifted students may need to alter its structure 
or content to meet these students' specific learning 
needs, but this is preferable to denying gifted children access to educational services that are the most accommodating to their abilities.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Role"></a>
<H3>Role of the Family</H3>

<P>The following are some broad guidelines - representing 
many viewpoints - for strategies to prevent or reverse underachieving behavior.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P><B>Supportive strategies</B>.  Gifted children thrive in a mutually 
respectful, nonauthoritarian, flexible, questioning atmosphere.  They need reasonable rules and guidelines, 
strong support and encouragement, consistently positive 
feedback, and help to accept some limitations - their own, 
as well as those of others.  Although these principles are 
appropriate for all children, parents of gifted children, believing that advanced intellectual ability also means advanced social and emotional skills, may allow their children 
excessive decision-making power before they have the 
wisdom and experience to handle such responsibility (Rimm, 1986).</P>

<P>        Gifted youngsters need adults who are willing to listen 
to their questions without comment.  Some questions 
merely preface their own opinions, and quick answers prevent them from using adults as a sounding board.  When 
problem solving is appropriate, offer a solution and encourage students to come up with their own answers and 
criteria for choosing the best solution.  Listen carefully.  
Show genuine enthusiasm about students' observations, 
interests, activities, and goals.  Be sensitive to problems, 
but avoid transmitting unrealistic or conflicting expectations 
and solving problems a student is capable on managing.</P>

<P>        Provide students with a wide variety of opportunities 
for success, a sense of  accomplishment, and a belief in 
themselves.  Encourage them to volunteer to help others 
as an avenue for developing tolerance, empathy, understanding, and acceptance of human limitations.  Above all, 
guide them toward activities and goals that reflect their values, interests, and needs, not just yours.  Finally, reserve 
some time to have fun, to be silly, to share daily activities.  
Like all youngsters, gifted children need to feel connected 
to people who are consistently supportive (Webb, 
Meckstroth, &#38; Tolan, 1982).</P>

<LI><P><B>Intrinsic strategies</B>.  Whether or not a gifted youngster uses 
exceptional ability in constructive ways depends, in part, 
on self-acceptance and self-concept.  According to 
Halsted (1988), "an intellectually gifted child will not be 
happy [and] complete until he is using intellectual ability at 
a level approaching full capacity.... It is important that parents and teachers see intellectual development as a requirement for these children, and not merely as an interest, a flair, or a phase they will outgrow"  (p. 24).</P>

<P>        Providing an early and appropriate educational environment can stimulate an early love for learning.  A young, 
curious student may easily become "turned off" if the educational environment is not stimulating; class placement 
and teaching approaches are inappropriate; the child experiences ineffective teachers; or assignments are consistently too difficult or too easy.  The gifted youngster's ability to define and solve problems in many ways (often described as fluency of innovative ideas or divergent thinking 
ability) may not be compatible with traditional gifted education programs or specific classroom requirements, in part 
because many gifted students are identified through 
achievement test scores (Torrance, 1977).  According to 
Linda Silverman (1989), Director of the Gifted Child 
Development Center in Denver, Colorado, a student's 
learning style can influence academic achievement.  She 
contends that  gifted underachievers often have advanced 
visual-spatial ability but underdeveloped sequencing skills; 
thus they have difficulty learning such subjects as phonics, 
spelling, foreign languages and mathematics facts in the 
way in which these subjects are usually taught (Silverman, 
1989).  Such students can often can be helped by knowledgeable adults to expand their learning styles, but they 
also need an environment that is compatible with their preferred ways of learning.  Older students can participate in 
pressure-free, noncompetitive summer activities that provide a wide variety of educational opportunities, including 
in-depth exploration, hands-on learning, and mentor relationships (Berger, 1989).</P>

<P>        Some students are more interested in learning than in 
working for grades. Such students might spend hours on a 
project that is unrelated to academic classes and fail to turn 
in required work.  They should be strongly encouraged to 
pursue their interests, particularly since those interests 
may lead to career decisions and life-long passions.  At the 
same time, they should be reminded that teachers may be 
unsympathetic when required work is incomplete.  Early career guidance emphasizing creative problem solving, decision making, and setting short- and long-term goals often helps them to complete required assignments, pass high 
school courses, and plan for college (Berger, 1989).  
Providing real-world experiences in an area of potential career interest may also provide inspiration and motivation 
toward academic achievement.</P>

<LI><P><B>Praise versus encouragement</B>.  Overemphasis on 
achievement or outcomes rather than a child's efforts, involvement, and desire to learn about topics of interest is a 
common parental pitfall.  The line between pressure and 
encouragement is subtle but important.  Pressure to perform emphasizes outcomes such as winning awards and 
getting A's, for which the student is highly praised.  
Encouragement emphasizes effort, the process used to 
achieve, steps taken toward accomplishing a goal, and improvement.  It leaves appraisal and valuation to the youngster.  Underachieving gifted students may be thought of as discouraged individuals who need encouragement but 
tend to reject praise as artificial or inauthentic (Kaufmann, 
1987).  Listen carefully to yourself.  Tell your children when 
you are proud of their efforts.  </P>

<LI><P><B>Remedial Strategies</B>.  Dinkmeyer and Losoncy (1980) caution parents to avoid discouraging their children by domination, insensitivity, silence, or intimidation.  Discouraging 
comments, such as "If you're so gifted, why did you get a D 
in _____?'' or "I've given you everything; why are you so 
_____?''  are never effective.  Constant competition may 
also lead to underachievement, especially when a child 
consistently feels like either a winner or a loser.   Avoid 
comparing children with others.  Show children how to 
function in competition and how to recover after losses. </P>
  
<P>        Study-skills courses, time-management classes, or 
special tutoring may be ineffective if a student is a long-term underachiever.  This approach will work only if the 
student is willing and eager, if the teacher is chosen carefully, and the course is supplemented by additional strategies designed to help the student.  On the other hand, special tutoring may help the concerned student who is 
experiencing short-term academic difficulty. In general, 
special tutoring for a gifted student is most helpful when 
the tutor is carefully chosen to match the interests and 
learning style of the student.  Broad-ranged study-skills 
courses or tutors who do not understand the student may 
do more harm than good.</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>Some students, particularly those who are highly capable 
and participate in a variety of activities, appear to be high 
achievers when learning in a highly structured academic 
environment, but are at risk of underachieving if they cannot establish priorities, focus on a selected number of activities, and set long-term goals.  On the other hand, some students appear to be underachievers but are not 
uncomfortable or discouraged. They may be quite 
discontent in middle or secondary school (in part because 
of the organization and structure), but happy and successful when learning in an environment with a different 
structural organization.  They may handle independence 
quite well.  </P>

<P>        Underachievement is made up of a complex web of 
behaviors, but it can be reversed by parents and educators 
who consider the many strengths and talents possessed 
by the students who may wear this label.</P>

<P>    Use this checklist to inspect your local school or community
playground. If you mark any items with an "X," ask the proper
school or park official to correct these hazards
immediately-before injuries occur.</P>

<blockquote>
 
 

<p>[  ] <B>Protective Surfacing</B> - The surfaces under and around play
     equipment should be soft enough to cushion falls. For most
     play equipment, these surfaces should contain a minimum of
     12 inches of wood chips, mulch, sand or pea gravel. </p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Fall Zones</B> - To cushion a fall, the shock absorbing material
     should extend a minimum of 6 feet in all directions from
     stationary pieces of play equipment. In front of and behind
     swings, the material should extend a distance equal to twice
     the height of the suspending bar.</p>
     
<p>[  ] <B> Equipment Spacing</B> - Play structures should be spaced at
     least 12 feet apart to allow children space to circulate or
     fall without striking another structure. Moving pieces of
     equipment should be located in an area away from other play
     structures so children have adequate room to pass from one
     play area to another without being struck by a moving swing
     or by another child exiting from a slide.</p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Catch Points and Protruding Hardware</B> - There should be no
     dangerous pieces of hardware, such as protruding bolt ends
     and narrow gaps in metal connections or open "S" hooks at
     the top and bottom of swings. Exposed hardware can cut
     children, puncture skin, or catch clothing drawstrings,
     which could strangle a child.</p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Openings that can trap</B> - Openings in guardrails, and spaces
     between platforms and between ladder rungs, should measure
     less than 3.5 inches or more than 9 inches. Children can get
     trapped and strangle in openings where they can fit their
     bodies but not their heads through the space.

<p>[  ]  <B>Pinch, Crush, Shearing, and Sharp Hazards</B> - Equipment should
     not have sharp points or edges that could cut skin. Moving
     pieces of equipment, such as suspension bridges, track
     rides, merry-go-rounds or, seesaws, should not have
     accessible moving parts that might crush or pinch a child's
     finger.

<p>[  ]  <B>Tripping Hazards</B> - There should be no exposed concrete
     footings, abrupt changes in surface elevations, tree roots,
     tree stumps, and rocks, which can trip children or adults.</p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Guardrails</B> - Elevated surfaces--such as platforms, ramps,
     and bridgeways--should have guardrails to prevent falls.</p>

<p>[  ]  <B>Routine Maintenance</B> - Find out if your playground has a
     designated official who periodically inspects the play
     equipment for preventive maintenance. This includes:
     replacing missing, broken, or worn-out components; securing
     hardware; checking for deterioration in the wood, metal, or
     plastic materials; maintaining the proper 12-inch depth of
     surfacing material; and cleaning up debris. </p>

<p>[  ] <B> Supervision</B> - The play area should be designed so that
     adults can observe children at play.
      </p>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC) today announced that Chairman Ann Brown
has awarded the CPSC Chairman's Commendation for
Significant Contributions to Product Safety to the American
Furniture Manufacturers Association (AFMA) for its efforts
to make bunk beds safe for the children and families of
America.</P>

<P>     "Whenever we can, we want to prevent problems before
they happen," Brown said. "In 1995, CPSC staff requested
several changes in the voluntary standard for bunk beds. We
explained the seriousness of the lower bunk entrapment
problem associated with bunk beds, and asked the leadership
of AFMA to communicate this to the members of the industry.
Thanks to their hard work, manufacturers have given their
support to a stronger voluntary standard."</P>

<P>     Brown cited AFMA's leadership in strengthening the
industry voluntary standard on spacing for bunk beds to help
keep children safe. The current voluntary standard addresses
entrapment hazards associated with the top bunk. The
manufacturers have agreed to strengthen the voluntary
standard to address entrapment hazards associated with lower
bunks.</P>

<P>     "We are a regulatory agency," Brown said. "But we
prefer to work voluntarily with industry. It is a pleasure
to recognize AFMA for helping make bunk beds safe."</P>

<P>     In addition to AFMA, the CPSC Chairman's Commendation
has been awarded to: Toys "R" Us; Procter &amp; Gamble; Sunbeam
Plastics; Playskool, a division of Hasbro Inc.;
Rollerblade Inc.; the International Inline Skating
Association; and the Whirlpool Corporation.</P>

<P>     Chairman Brown initiated the commendation program to
recognize substantial contributions to product safety by
individuals, companies, or groups for one-time, ongoing, or
multiple actions. Nominees for the award, which is given
periodically, may be brought to the Chairman's attention.
Chairman Brown will consider the following factors in
choosing award recipients:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Actions that contribute to reducing hazards to children
	 and other vulnerable populations;
	<LI>Voluntary actions that are not mandated by government
	 regulations, that anticipate
	 government regulation, or that go beyond what the government
	 requires;
	<LI>Developments that affect the safety of large numbers of
 individuals;
	<LI>Innovations or improvements to existing products;
	 and safety devices, packaging, warnings, or products
	 which enhance consumer safety.
</UL>

<P>   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the
public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's
fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)
638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the
release number. Consumers can obtain this release
and recall information via Internet gopher services at
cpsc.gov or report product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<P>ALEXANDRIA, Va., May 3, 1996 -- Each spring as the grass begins to grow, millions of people follow the annual path to lawn and garden care. Friendly neighbors haul out their mowers, lawn tractors edgers, tillers, and chipper/shredders because they know this equipment provides the best route to beautiful landscape. But, along the way, some also haul out old, unsafe operating habits and this is where they unknowingly turn down a dangerous path...toward the possibility of accidents, especially to children.</P>

<P>The tendency to take kids for a ride on the mower is a careless old habit, probably learned by people who remember going for rides on lawn tractors when they were young. They think that it's okay to ride with their kids too. But riding with a child on a mower was an unsafe practice then, just as it is today.</P>

<P>Riding mowers are designed to provide many safety features for the operator, but they are not built for passengers. Simply stated, children should not be anywhere near the operation of lawnmowers or anywhere near the mowing area. This goes for all types of outdoor power equipment.</P>

<P>Furthermore, the media sometimes adds to the problem unintentionally -- with a newspaper occasionally picturing a happy parent riding on a mower with a child on their lap. It may be a cute picture -- but it sends the wrong message about mowing safely, and, hopefully, wise customers will realize this.</P>

<P>Lawnmower racing is another careless habit with a direct route down a dangerous path. Consumers-should remember, <racing> is another careless habit with a direct route down a dangerous path. Consumers should remember, riding mowers are hard-working utilitarian machines with sharp cutting blades designed to do yard work. They were not designed for racing -- even if the cutting deck is removed. Avoid the urge to treat them as such. A racing mindset could influence youngsters (as well as adults) to operate a riding mower carelessly which could lead to accidents.</P>

<P>Remember, think safety with power in your hands,"when operating any type of outdoor power equipment, practice these important do's and dont's..</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Do read the manufacturer's operator's manual before operating.

	<BR><BR><LI>Do keep small children out of the mowing area, and preferably indoors under adult supervision.

	<BR><BR><LI>Do be alert and turn the mower off if children enter the area.

	<BR><BR><LI>Do, before operating in reverse, look behind and down for small children.

	<BR><BR><LI>Don't carry children. Riding mowers are designed for one operator only.

	<BR><BR><LI>Don't allow children to operate a riding mower.

	<BR><BR><LI>Do use extra cars when approaching corners, shrubs, and trees.

	<BR><BR><LI>Do handle fuel carefully and avoid spilling when you're filling.

	<BR><BR><LI>Do wear the proper clothing -- long slacks and sturdy shoes.

	<BR><BR><LI>Don't drive a riding mower like a race car -- it's a mower, not a racer.
</UL>

<P>Remember, carelessness is the leading cause of accidents and that's why the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute urges homeowners always to "think safety" when operating any type of outdoor power equipment.</P>

<P>ROSEMONT, Ill., May 9, 1996 -- "Mother knows best" when it comes to advising daughters about the value of milk to help build strong bones to last a lifetime. And according to a recent study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, daughters are following mom's example at the dinner table.</P>

<P>Researchers from Oregon State University in Corvallis found that a mother's strong milk-drinking practice can positively influence her daughter's milk consumption, which may help reduce her future risk of osteoporosis. This is welcome news this Mother's Day -- the official start of National Osteoporosis Prevention Week, May 12-18, an annual observance that aims to reduce the incidence of this debilitating bone disease.</P>

<H3>Boning-Up On The Facts</H3>

<P>Today, more than 8 million Americans suffer from osteoporosis, which is characterized by decreased bone mass and increased risk of fractures. Also, an additional 17 million are at high risk due to low bone mass. Eighty percent of these individuals are women. The worldwide incidence of osteoporosis is predicted to increase three-fold over the next 60 years due to an increase in life expectancy. And, osteoporosis costs the nation in hospital and nursing home bills more than $10 billion annually.</P>

<P>But researchers agree that osteoporosis is preventable and treatable. And one of the best strategies to prevent the disease is maintaining adequate calcium intake, starting early in life to build peak bone mass.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, government food consumption surveys reveal that more than 50 percent of women fail to meet their needs for calcium. "If we really want to do something to reduce the incidence of osteoporosis, we must start by working on our teens and on our children to foster skeletal health," says author Cornelia Ulrich, who conducted the mother-daughter pairs research at Oregon State University. "Many of the 1.5 million annual bone fractures attributed to osteoporosis might be reduced by committing to calcium-rich foods like milk and dairy products at an early age."</P>

<H3>Calcium Counts</H3>

<P>The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for calcium varies from one age or stage of life to another. Adult women need 800 mg of calcium each day, which can be met by consuming at least three servings of dairy foods dally. Adolescents and young women 11 to 24 years need even more calcium: at least 1,200 mg or four servings of dairy daily.</P>

<P>However, some health organizations, including the National Osteoporosis Foundation and an expert panel convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1994 say the RDA for calcium is too low. They assert that the RDA focuses on the maintenance of calcium balance, but additional calcium -- 
1,000 mg each day for adults -- is required to maximize peak bone mass and minimize bone loss. NIH also recommends that adolescents and young adults should aim for 1,200 to 1,500 mg per day.</P>

<H3>Putting The Brakes On The Breaks</H3>

<P>Experts agree that adequate calcium intake during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood is needed to maximize peak bone mass and slow bone loss that occurs with aging. And dairy products are the richest source of well-absorbed calcium, according to Connie Weaver, Ph.D., professor of foods and nutrition at Purdue University. Yet bones aren't built on calcium alone. Weaver offers these immediate strategies to help women reduce the risk of osteoporosis:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>


<LI> Eat three or more servings of calcium-rich dairy products every day.

<br><br><LI> Don't forget about the vitamin D in milk, which helps your body absorb calcium

<br><br><LI> Step up weight-bearing physical activity.

<br><br><LI> Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol intake.
</UL>

<H3>Bone-Building Basics</H3>

<P>To help women learn more bone-building basics, a free brochure called "Banking on Beautiful Bones" is now available. Developed by the National Diary Council, National Osteoporosis Foundation and The American Dietetic Association, the brochure offers lifestyle recommendations for preventing osteoporosis as well as strategies for boosting intake by including a variety of dairy foods in their diets.</P>

<P>The brochure is available free by sending a self-addressed, stamped letter-sized envelope to: National Dairy Council, "Banking on Beautiful Bones," 10255 W. Higgins Road, Suite 900, Rosemont, Ill., 60018-5616.</P>

<P>Most parents greet the discovery that their child is not 
merely gifted but highly or profoundly gifted with a combination of pride, excitement, and fear.  They may set out 
to find experts or books to help them cope with raising 
such a child, only to find there are no real experts, only a 
couple of books, and very little understanding of extreme 
intellectual potential and how to develop it.  This digest 
deals with some areas of concern and provides a few 
practical suggestions based on the experience of other 
parents and the modest amount of research available.</P>

<a name="Differences"></a>
<H3>Differences</H3>

<P>To understand highly gifted children it is essential to realize 
that, although they are children with the same basic needs 
as other children, they are very different.  Adults cannot 
ignore or gloss over their differences without doing serious 
damage to these children, for the differences will not go 
away or be outgrown.  They affect almost every aspect of 
these children's intellectual and emotional lives.</P>

<P>        A microscope analogy is one useful way of understanding extreme intelligence.  If we say that all people look 
at the world through a lens, with some lenses cloudy or 
distorted, some clear, and some magnified, we might say 
that gifted individuals view the world through a microscope 
lens and the highly gifted view it through an electron 
microscope.  They see ordinary things in very different 
ways and often see what others simply cannot see.  
Although there are advantages to this heightened 
perception, there are disadvantages as well.</P>

<P>        Since many children eventually become aware of being different, it is important to prepare yourself for your 
child's reactions.  When your child's giftedness has been 
identified, you might open a discussion using the microscope analogy.  If you are concerned that such a discussion will promote arrogance, be sure to let children know 
that unusual gifts, like hair and eye color, are not earned. It 
is neither admirable nor contemptible to be highly gifted. It 
is what one does with one's abilities that is important.</P>

<hr>

<a name="A"></a>
<H3>A United Front</H3>

<P>As in most other aspects of parenting, it is important for 
both parents (or the adults who bear primary responsibility 
for raising the child) to agree on some basic issues 
regarding the child's potential. Many parents of exceptionally gifted children were themselves gifted or exceptionally gifted children.  If they did not learn to accept and 
understand their own giftedness, they may find it difficult to 
accept their child's unusual capacities.  Raising a highly 
gifted child may help parents come to terms with many difficult aspects of their own lives, but it helps if they focus 
first on the needs of the child and come to an agreement 
about how to meet them.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What the Highly Gifted Need</H3>

<P>Exceptionally gifted children have two primary needs. First, 
they need to feel comfortable with themselves and with the 
differences that simultaneously open possibilities and 
create difficulty. Second, they need to develop their 
astonishing potential.  There is a strong internal drive to 
develop one's abilities.  Thwarting that drive may lead to 
crippling emotional damage.  Throughout the parenting 
years, it is wise to keep in mind that the healthiest long term 
goal is not necessarily a child who gains fame, fortune, and 
a Nobel Prize, but one who becomes a comfortable adult 
and uses gifts productively.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="The"></a>
<H3>The Early Years</H3>

<P>Before your child begins formal schooling, differences can 
be handled by your willingness to follow the child's lead 
and meet needs as they arise.  It is possible and important 
to treat an infant's or toddler's precocity with a degree of 
normalcy.  For example, a 2-year-old who prefers and plays 
appropriately with toys designed for 6-year-olds should be 
given those toys.  The 3-year-old who reads should be 
given books.  The child who speaks very early and with a 
sophisticated vocabulary should be spoken to in kind.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Public"></a>
<H3>Public Attitudes</H3>

<P>Even when parents can take precocious achievements in 
stride, friends, family and strangers may not.  Unthinking 
people will comment (often loudly and in front of the child) 
that a 2- or 3-year-old who sits in the grocery cart reading 
packages aloud is a phenomenon.</P>

<P>        It may be surprisingly difficult to avoid letting parental 
pride lure you into encouraging your children to "perform" 
in public.  Keep in mind the goal of making the child as 
comfortable as possible with individual differences.  The 
more casually you accept unusual early accomplishments, 
the more your children will be able to see those 
accomplishments as normal.  Later, when the gifts are no 
longer quite as noticeable, the child will not feel that what 
made him or her valuable has somewhat been lost.</P>

<a name="Multiple"></a>
<H3>Multiple Ages</H3>

<P>Highly gifted children are many ages simultaneously.  A 5-
year-old may read like a 7-year-old, play chess like a 12-
year-old, talk like a 13-year-old, and share toys like a 2-year-
old. A child may move with lightning speed from a 
reasoned discussion of the reasons for taking turns on the 
playground to a full-scale temper tantrum when not allowed 
to be first on the swing.  You can help yourself maneuver 
among the child's ages by reading about developmental 
norms (Gesell is a good guide) so that you are ready for 
(and avoid punishing) behavior that, though it seems 
childish in a precocious child, is absolutely age appropriate.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="School"></a>
<H3>School</H3>

<P>If your nine month old begins speaking in full sentences, 
you probably will not tell the child to stop and wait till other 
nine month olds catch up.  You would not limit such a child 
to using nouns because that is as much speech as most 
nine month olds can handle.  However, in public or private 
school that may be the approach some educators use.</P>

<P>        It is important to realize that they are not purposely 
setting out to keep your child from learning, although that 
might be the effect.  Many educators have never knowingly 
dealt with a highly gifted child.  They do not recognize 
them, and they do not know how to handle them.  Some 
educators base teaching methods an developmental 
norms that are inappropriate for highly gifted children.  
Although they may be willing to make an effort to accommodate these youngsters, they may lack sufficient 
information or experience and not know what type of effort 
to make.  </P>
      
<P>        When a  child enters school already able to do what the 
teacher intends to teach, there is seldom a variety of 
mechanisms for teaching that child something else.  Even 
if there were a way to provide time, attention, and an 
appropriate curriculum, it would be necessary for the 
teacher to use different teaching methods.  Highly gifted 
children learn not only faster than others, but also differently.  Standard teaching methods take complex subjects and break them into small, simple bits presented one 
at a time.  Highly gifted minds can consume large amounts 
of information in a single gulp, and they thrive on 
complexity.  Giving these children simple bits of information 
is like feeding an elephant one blade of grass at a time - he 
will starve before he even realizes that anyone is trying to 
feed him.</P>

<P>        When forced to work with the methods and pace of a 
typical school, highly gifted children may look not more 
capable than their peers, but less capable.  Many of their 
normal characteristics add to this problem. Their handwriting might be very messy because their hands do not 
keep pace with their quick minds.  Many spell poorly because they read for comprehension and do not see the 
words as collections of separate letters.  When they try to 
"sound out" a word, their logical spelling of an illogical language results in errors. Most have difficulty with rote 
memorization, a standard learning method in the early 
grades.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Lack"></a>
<H3>Lack of Fit
</H3>
<P>The difficulty with highly gifted children in school may be 
summarized in three words: they don't fit.  Almost all 
American schools organize groups of children by age. As 
we have seen, the highly gifted child is many ages.  The 
child's intellectual needs might be years ahead of same-age peers, although the gulf may be larger in some subject 
areas than in others.</P>

<P>        Imagine 6-year old Rachel.  She reads on a 12th grade 
level, although her comprehension is "only" that of a 7th 
grader.  She does multiplication and division, understands 
fractions and decimals, but counts on her fingers because 
she has never memorized addition and subtraction facts or 
multiplication tables.  Her favorite interests at home are 
paleontology and astronomy; at school her favorite 
interests are lunch and recess.  She collects stamps and 
plays chess.  Although she can concentrate at her telescope for hours at a time, she cannot sit still when she's 
bored. She cries easily, loses her temper often, bosses 
other children when they "don't do it right," and can't keep 
track of her personal belongings.  She has a sophisticated 
sense of humor that disarms adults but is not understood 
by other children.</P>

<P>        Putting Rachel into a normal first grade without paying 
special attention to her differences is a recipe for social, 
emotional and educational disaster.  Even if a gifted 
program is available (they commonly begin in third or fourth 
grade), it is unlikely to meet her extreme needs.</P>

<P>        Educating a highly gifted child in school is like clothing 
a 6X child in a store where the largest available garment is a 
3 (or with a gifted program, a 3X).  Parents have to resort to 
alterations or individual tailoring of whatever kind they can 
manage.</P>

<P>        In dealing with school issues, it's important to remember that you know more about your child than anyone 
else.  Your knowledge, information, and instincts are useful 
and important, and they should be recognized in 
designing a school program.  Your child genuinely needs 
individual attention.  Anything else may be directly and 
seriously harmful.</P>

<P>        There is no ideal school pattern for the highly gifted.  
However, when normal school patterns lead to difficulty, it 
is important to obtain real differentiation.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Acceleration"></a>
<H3>Acceleration</H3>

<P>Because highly gifted children may begin school already 
knowing much of the material covered in early grades and 
because they learn quickly, some type of acceleration is 
necessary.  For some children and in some situations, 
grade skipping is the best choice.  Placing a child with older 
children who share interests may be socially and 
intellectually beneficial and result in a more appropriate 
curriculum.  It is also a simple and economical solution for 
the school.  Some children begin school early; others skip 
several early grades; others skip whole educational levels, 
such as junior high or even high school.  Skipping a single 
year is seldom helpful, because the difference between 
one grade level and the next is too small.  Grade skipping is 
not without problems, but allowing highly gifted children to 
stay in a class that meets few if any of their needs may do 
serious and long-term damage.</P>

<P>        Another type of acceleration is subject matter acceleration.  A child may take math with a class four grades 
ahead, reading with a class two grades ahead, physical 
education with age peers.  This type of acceleration considers the varying developmental ages of the highly gifted 
child.  For further flexibility, you might consider evening 
classes or weekend classes at a high school or college and 
ask the school to excuse coverage of those subjects in 
regular classes.  A child might go to school with age mates 
only in the morning or only in the afternoon.  This method 
calls for school and parental flexibility and may lead to 
logistical problems such as scheduling and transportation, 
but is often more satisfactory than grade skipping because 
the child associates at least part of the time with age peers.</P>

<a name="When"></a>
<H3>When the School Will Not Change</H3>

<P>When parents approach teachers and administrators with 
information and documentation, in a spirit of cooperation 
instead of confrontation, offering suggestions and help 
instead of attacking, some positive changes in normal 
methods usually result.  Sometimes, however, schools  
refuse to make changes for one child.  When this happens, 
parents have few choices.  One is to move to a school 
system that will make changes. Another is home schooling.</P>

<P>        For many highly gifted children home schooling is a 
nearly ideal solution to the problem of fit.  Instead of laboriously altering ready-made programs, parents can tailor 
an education precisely to the child's needs.  Clubs, sports, 
scouting, and other activities supply social interaction with 
other children while parents serve as teachers or facilitators 
or engage tutors or mentors in various subject areas.</P>

<P>        Home schooling is seldom an easy choice.  In some 
districts it is either illegal or beset with regulations that make 
it almost as rigid as classroom schooling.  When both 
parents or the single resident parent must work, it may be 
impossible.  Some parents and children find the level of 
togetherness stifling, while others cannot avoid pushing 
and demanding too much.  However, home schooling may 
be a positive choice for many families.  Many children move 
surprisingly smoothly from home schooling in the early 
years into high school or college when their intellectual 
needs outgrow the home environment.  One of the major 
benefits to education at home is the maintenance of self esteem, which is highly problematic in a school 
environment. </P>

<a name="Social"></a>
<H3>Social/Emotional Needs</H3>

<P>In the movie E.T. there was something heartrending in the 
small alien's attempts to "phone home," in his constant 
longing for others of his kind despite the loving concern of 
the family who cared for him.  Highly gifted children endure 
some of that same pain.  It is hard for them to find kindred 
spirits, hard for them to feel they fit into the only world they 
know.</P>

<P>        Highly gifted children may have trouble establishing 
fulfilling friendships with people of their own age when 
there are few or no other highly gifted children with whom 
to interact.  As a high school student told his mother, "I can 
be that part of myself that is like my classmates, and we get 
along fine. But, there's no one I can share the rest of me 
with, no one who understands what means the most to 
me."  For most highly gifted children, social relationships 
with age peers necessitate a constant monitoring of 
thoughts, words, and behavior.</P>

<P>        One of the greatest benefits of the talent searches 
proliferating in colleges across the country is the chance 
for highly gifted children to spend time with others like 
themselves.  For 3 weeks in the summer, children who 
qualify (by scoring high enough on the SAT or ACT in the 
seventh grade or earlier) attend class on a college campus 
with other highly gifted children.  Rather than feeling like 
oddballs, they suddenly feel normal.  Lifelong friendships 
may form in a matter of days.  Many summer program participants consider the social interaction as valuable as the 
classes.</P>

<P>        What else can you do to help highly gifted children find 
friends?   It helps children to understand that there are 
different types of friends.  They may play baseball, ride 
bikes, and watch TV with one person, talk about books or 
movies with another, and play chess or discuss astronomy 
with another.  Some of these friends may be their own age, 
some may be younger, or more often, older.  Only in 
school is it suggested that people must be within a few 
months of each other in age to form meaningful relationships.</P>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>Raising a highly gifted child may be ecstasy, agony and 
everything between.  Adults must perform almost impossible feats of balance - supporting a child's gifts without 
pushing, valuing without overinvesting, championing 
without taking over.  It is costly, physically and emotionally 
draining, and intellectually demanding.  In the first flush of 
pride, few parents realize that their task is in many ways 
similar to the task faced by parents of a child with severe 
handicaps.  Our world does not accommodate differences 
easily, and it matters little whether the difference is perceived to be a deficit or an overabundance.</P>

<P>        We have covered only a few issues in this space, but 
the most important help you can give your highly gifted 
child or children can be expressed in a single sentence: 
Give them a safe home, a refuge where they feel love and 
genuine acceptance, even of their differences.  As adults 
with a safe home in their background, they can put together lives of productivity and fulfillment.</P>

<P>Historically, tension has existed between gifted education and middle
school education (Tomlinson, 1992), leaving some advocates of each 
educational practice suspicious of the other, and leaving middle 
school students who are advanced in one or more dimensions of learning
in a sort of educational no-man's-land.  While some legitimate areas 
of disagreement are likely to persist, there are enough areas of 
shared belief to bridge the practice between gifted education and 
middle school education.  This digest provides an overview of 
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>some
	areas of agreement between the fields, 
	<LI> some areas of tension, and
	<LI>some promising directions that could engage educators in mutual 
	planning of appropriate services for all middle school students, 
	including those we sometimes call "gifted."</P>
</OL>

<a name="Shared"></a>
<H3>Shared Beliefs Of Gifted Education And Middle School Education</H3>

<P>There are at least three areas of common concern shared by gifted 
education and middle school education.  </P>

<P><B>First</B>, when it comes to articulated beliefs about what 
constitutes appropriate instruction for early adolescents, both 
groups are proponents of instruction that:

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>is theme based, 
	<LI>is interdisciplinary, 
	<LI>fosters student self-direction and independence, 
	<LI>promotes self-understanding, 
	<LI>incorporates basic skills, 
	<LI>is relevant to the learner and thus based on study of significant problems, 
	<LI>is student-centered, 
	<LI>promotes student discovery, 
	<LI>values group interaction, 
	<LI>is built upon student interest, 
	<LI>encourages critical and creative exploration of ideas, and 
	<LI>promotes student self-evaluation (e.g., Currier, 1986; Kaplan, 1979; Maker &amp; Nielson, 1995; Stevenson, 1992).
</OL>
</P>


<P> <B>Second,</B> few educators of the gifted would argue with the core 
tenets set forth in <i>Turning Points</i> (Carnegie Task Force on the 
Education of Young Adolescents, 1989) that middle school programs 
should:  
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>create small communities of learning within larger school
settings, 
	<LI>teach a solid academic core, 
	<LI>ensure success for all 
students, 
	<LI>enable educators closest to students to make 
	important decisions about teaching and learning, 
	<LI>staff middle 
	schools with teachers trained to work effectively with early 
	adolescents, 
	<LI>promote health and fitness, 
	<LI>involve families in 
	the education of learners, and 
	<LI> connect schools with communities.
</OL></P>

<P>       <B>Third</B>, both groups of educators share a deep concern for the 
cognitive and affective welfare of early adolescent learners.  Both 
groups also understand that there is great variability in the 
academic, social, emotional, and physical development of the early 
adolescent group.  Both also subscribe to the reality that early 
adolescents are subject to change, including spurts in physical 
growth, new interests, and intellectual awareness.  And both believe 
that all middle school students should take part in challenging 
learning experiences.</P>

<a name="Gifted"></a>
<H3>Gifted Education And Middle School Education: Problems And Promise</H3>

<P>The following issues have concerned educators in gifted education and 
middle level education.  But emerging dialogue offers promise and some
evident next steps for moving ahead into a more collaborative future 
(Clews, 1995). </P>

<H3><I>Excellence vs. Equity </I></H3>

<P><B>Problem:</B></P>

<P>Gifted education exists to foster development of high-end excellence.
It therefore stresses practices that are most likely to promote 
"expertise" in learners with advanced performance and/or potential.  
Middle school education, on the other hand, views education through 
an equity lens, where all students have an equal opportunity to 
succeed.  In a country that has struggled with the competing values 
of equity and excellence throughout its history (Gardner, 1961), it is
not surprising that both groups continue to struggle with mechanisms 
for balancing the belief that all people should have equal opportunity
with the belief that each individual should be assisted in 
developing his or her maximum capacity.  The tension is heightened in
the face of scarce resources for education.</P>

<P><B> Promising Directions: </B>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Understand the advantages of emphasizing both equity and 
        	excellence.
	<LI>Plan for both personal excellence and equity of access to 
        	advancement for all learners who are at risk, including those who are
        	gifted.
 	<LI>Emphasize raising the floors and eliminating the ceilings of 
        	educational performance.
	<LI>Emphasize both personal excellence and "apex" or "high-end" 
        	excellence.
</UL></P>

<H3><I>Emphasis on Heterogeneity</I></H3>

<B>Problem:</B>

<P>Because middle school educators emphasize the negative impact of 
homogeneous grouping on at-risk learners, heterogeneity has become a 
hallmark descriptor of "good" middle schools (Carnegie Task Force on 
the Education of Young Adolescents, 1989).  But educators of the 
gifted value the benefits of ability grouping for advanced learners. 
The availability of some forms of homogeneous grouping for these 
learners has been strongly advocated by proponents of gifted 
education (Allan, 1991).  Educators of the gifted are also concerned 
about a lack of emphasis on differentiated instruction for academic 
diversity in heterogeneous classrooms in the literature of middle 
school, and reject a one-size-fits-all approach to educating students 
as varied as those who inhabit middle schools.</P>

<P><B>Promising Directions:</B>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
 	<LI>Abandon practices that permit or encourage one-size-fits-all 
        	instruction.
	<LI>Replace exclusive services with more inclusive ones.
	<LI>Emphasize appropriately differentiated instruction in 
        	heterogeneous classrooms.
	<LI>Use heterogeneous teams, but group and regroup within a team 
        	and across teams for instructional purposes.
	<LI>Offer a variety of classes that allow for student choice.
	<LI>Emphasize use of gifted/talented resource specialists as part 
 	<LI>of interdisciplinary teams.
</UL></P>

<H3><I>Use of Labels</I></H3>

<P><B>Problem:</B></P>

<P>Middle school advocates often reject labeling students as "learning 
disabled" or "gifted" (George, 1993).  Such labeling, they believe, 
favors some students and stigmatizes others.  Advocates of gifted 
education believe that identifying high potential and performance is 
necessary if awareness of and planning for talent development is to 
occur (Coleman &amp; Gallagher, 1995).</P>

<P><B>Promising Directions :</B>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Develop ways to identify and address students' needs without 
        	overt labeling.
	<LI>Work to balance emphasis on student differences and student 
        	similarities.
	<LI>Use the term "gifted" as part of a phrase that describes 
        	students as gifted in mathematics, science, writing, visual arts, music, etc.
</UL></P>

<H3><I>Ambiguity About Appropriate Middle School Curricula</I></H3>

<P><B>Problem:</B></P>

<P>For much of its 30-year history, middle school education has attended
more to issues such as student affect, scheduling, detracking, 
teaming, and school climate than to what constitutes effective and 
appropriate curricula in middle school classes (Beane, 1990).  
Educators of the gifted, who place strong value on challenging 
opportunities for advanced learners in their area(s) of strength, 
have been concerned about middle level education, including a basic 
skills approach to instruction.  On the other hand, middle school 
educators argue that what has been called "gifted education" (e.g., 
enrichment, high level thinking, problem-solving) is good education 
for all learners, and should not be reserved for any single group of 
middle school students.  They believe that energies of educators 
should be focused on establishing that sort of "good education" in 
heterogeneous classrooms and that the proliferation of such 
classrooms would serve all middle school students well.</P>

<P><B>Promising Directions:</B>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Disavow theories that present middle school students as 
        	incapable of high level thought and complex learning.
	<LI>Abandon practices that couch middle school as a place for 
        	drill and skill.
	<LI>Collaborate in establishing complex, problem-based, 
        	student-centered curricula, differentiated for student readiness, 
        	interest, and learning style.
	<LI>Articulate differences between "good education" and "good 
        	gifted education."
	<LI>Ensure that services restricted to gifted students are taught 
        	at a pace, level of complexity, and level of abstractness that is 
        	consistent with their abilities and instructional needs.
</UL></P>

<H3><I>Use of Cooperative Learning as an Instructional Strategy</I></H3>

<P><B>Problem:</B></P>

Middle school educators promote cooperative learning as a prime means 
of establishing effective heterogeneous communities of learning 
(Slavin, 1980; Toepfer, 1992).  Educators of the gifted find that 
overuse of some cooperative learning strategies, particularly those 
focused on learning of basic information and skills, results in a lack
of challenge for advanced learners, inordinate use of these learners 
as "junior teachers," and inappropriate pressure for these learners 
to solve instructional problems (Robinson, 1990).

<P><B>Promising Directions:</B>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Acknowledge the appropriateness of collaborative learning for 
        	early adolescents.
	<LI>Emphasize problem-based cooperative strategies rather than 
        	skill-focused cooperative strategies.
	<LI>Move away from cooperative learning as a "savior" strategy.
	<LI>Teach and balance cooperation, independence, and healthy 
        	competition.
	<LI>Use various grouping patterns in cooperative groups, based on 
        	instructional purpose.
</UL></P>

<H3><I>Affective Needs of Early Adolescents</I></H3>

<P><B>Problem:</B></P>

<P>Middle school educators stress development of school environments in 
which early adolescents can belong to a nurturing group and have 
consistent access to adults who know and care about them (George &amp; 
Shewey, 1994).  Most educators of the gifted have concerns that 
affective experiences of advanced learners, which sometimes take on "a
different spin," are overlooked in middle schools where advanced 
learning is deemphasized and where few teachers are trained to 
understand advanced learners.  For example, peer pressure to conform 
may be experienced in a somewhat different context by many 
academically talented females and minority students than by other 
agemates (Ford, 1994; Kerr, 1985).  </P>

<P><B>Promising Directions:</B>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Recognize that early adolescents share common affective needs,
        	but experience them in differing ways.
	<LI>Plan for both achievement and belonging for advanced learners,
        with special emphasis on females and culturally diverse learners.
</UL></P>


<H3><I>General Tension</I></H3>

<P><B>Problem:</B></P>  

<P>The result of strongly held and often divergent views about educating
early adolescents has led to some tension between the two groups of 
educators.  Leaders of each group have not always attempted to build 
bridges.  Publications, conferences, team meetings, and informal 
dialogues among educators have only recently begun to break ground in 
listening and attempting to find solutions. </P>

<P><B>Promising Directions:</B>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Acknowledge strengths and contributions of both practices.
	<LI>Use constructive language when discussing the issues.
	<LI>Communicate, cooperate, and collaborate at every level of 
        	educational practice.

<P>BALTIMORE, May 7, 1996 -- The National Teen Pregnancy Clock is ticking, counting the staggering numbers of newly-pregnant teens and babies born to children so far this year.</P>

<P>The clock, located on the World Wide Web site launched today by Campaign For Our Children, Inc., is a visual reminder of the magnitude of the teen pregnancy problem in the United States, where a teenager becomes pregnant every 26 seconds. <b> The web site URL is http://www.cfoc.org.</b></P>

<P>The site is a forum for parents, educators, public health professionals and local government officials to discuss and exchange information about teen pregnancy prevention. "This is the most comprehensive site dedicated to this issue, said Hal Donofrio executive director of Campaign For Our Children. The interactivity of the web enabled us to create a sense of community among these different groups."</P>

<P>The site is particularly useful for parents baffled at the prospect of incorporating AIDS and sexually-transmitted infections into what used to be the talk about the birds and the bees. "How To Talk To Your Kids About Sex" provide a helpful list of what to say and what not to say ("Door Openers" and "Door Slammers") when initiating conversations about sex. Parents can join discussion groups and take a screening quiz to help them determine how at-risk their child is of being an adolescent parent. A featured public health expert will be available to answer questions; both questions and answers will be posted on a bulletin board.</P>

<P>Teachers will find downloadable lesson plans and related materials appropriate for middle school-level children. Community and church groups and health and social service organizations interested in implementing a mass media campaign can browse the catalog of television and radio spots, transit ads and institutional posters created by Campaign For Our Children. Video clips of the television spots can be downloaded for previewing, and all materials can be ordered online. Number-crunchers, researchers and journalists will find an extensive compilation of information about adolescent pregnancy, including facts, figures and statistics, a bibliography of source material and a list of the most frequently reported teen pregnancy myths.</P>

<P>Campaign For Our Children, Inc., is a non-profit abstinence-based teen pregnancy prevention program aimed at pre-sexually active children between the ages of nine and 14. Its multi-dimensional program incorporates print, transit, television and radio advertising with in-school lesson plans and activities. Originally developed for the state of Maryland, the program has been incorporated in adolescent pregnancy prevention programs in Arkansas Arizona, California, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Nevada, New York. North Carolina,, Tennessee and Virginia.</P>

<P>BALTIMORE, May 8, 1996 -- A new vaccine may prevent up to 85% of serious pneumococcal-related illnesses, such as middle-ear infections, pneumonia and meningitis in infants, according to researchers with the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Center for Vaccine Development.</P>

<P>Worldwide, pneumococcal pneumonia causes approximately 1.2 million deaths each year, and nearly 40% of all pneumonia deaths in children under five years of age. Pneumococcus bacteria is also the primary cause of meningitis.</P>

<P>Margaret Rennels, MD, professor with the center, reported at the annual meeting of three pediatric academic societies in Washington, D.C., that a seven-valent pneumococcal vaccine administered to 100 infants at two, four, and six months is safe and induces an antibody response to all seven serotypes in the formulation, which together account for 85% of all pneumococcal serotypes.</P>

<P>Over 20 million office visits per year, and 3 million emergency room visits, are attributed to otitis media, or fluid in the ear, resulting from middle-ear ineections. The pneumococcus bacteria is the primary cause of ear infections. Children who experience a pneumococcal infection before the age of one often develop chronic ear infections.</P>

<P>"Virtually everyone becomes infected with pneumococci eventually, and at any time we may be carrying the bacteria in our nose and throat," said Dr. Rennels. "As an increasing number of bacterial strains became resistant to antibiotics, the need for such vaccines will become more imperative."</P>

<P>The vaccine is a glycoconjugate, modeled after the Haemophilus b glycoconjugate. Vaccines made from the capsule of the pneumococcus are available for older children and adults, but young children cannot make antibodies to the capsule. By coupling the pneumococcal capsule with a protein carrier, researchers have been able to create a vaccine that will trigger an infant's immune system to produce antibodies.</P>

<P>Based upon the encouraging results of this study, efficacy trials for the vaccine are in progress.</P>

<P>The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine studied by Dr. Rennels and her colleagues was developed by scientists at Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines and Pediatrics.</P>

<P>QUINCY, Mass., May 3, 1996 -- Today the nonprofit National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) responded to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ruling regarding children's sleepwear with disappointment and deep concern for the safety of America's children. The CPSC ruling allows children's sleepwear to be made of flammable materials like untreated cotton, so long as it is tight-fitting on children or the age it is designed for. And CPSC's ruling totally exempts sleepwear for children up to 9 months of age, on the ground that they are not mobile enough to approach dangerous open flames.</P>

<P>"Children age five and under are twice as likely to die in fire as everyone else," says NFPA research expert Dr. John R. Hall, Jr. "CPSC's ruling has removed needed protection from this highly vulnerable group. As Chairman Ann Brown said in her minority statement opposing the changes, "the sleepwear standards are working." We believe that CPSC's reasoning in support of this change was fatally flawed in a number of ways."</P>

<P>Specifically, these include NFPA's concern that clothes designed to be tight-fitting may not be tight-fitting in practice. Oversized garments are likely to be purchased for children in order to provide greater comfort and room to grow. When this occurs, parents will be stripping their children of any protection from open flame clothing fires and the severe, often fatal, burns they can cause. For preschoolers, already at higher risk of death from fire, the results could be catastrophic.</P>

<P>NFPA says the greatest fire dangers to small children come from other young children. "Every year, hundreds of children die in fires caused by children playing with fire. They represent more than a third of all the preschoolers killed in fires each year," says Dr. Hall. "Many nine-month-old infants will be able to crawl or walk toward the attractive hazard of an open flame in the hands of an older sibling or playmate. Once they enter the play circle, these toddlers will be exposed to clothing ignition with no protection at all."</P>

<P>Dr. Hall notes that CPSC made this change with provisions for enhanced labeling, consumer education by industry, and close tracking of any change in burn experience. "This means that CPSC shares NFPA's concern that this relaxation will cause a real hazard for children. Unfortunately, there is no early-warning system for clothing fires," concludes Dr. Hall. "The first evidence that the new standard isn't working will be burned bodies of small children. That's a terribly high price to pay to test a speculative theory that proven fire protection can be rolled back without consequence."</P>

<P>Celebrating its 100th anniversary, the National Fire Protection Association has led the way to fire safety since 1896. The mission of the international nonprofit organization is to reduce the burden of fire on the quality of life by advocating scientifically based consensus codes and standards, research, and education for fire and related safety issues. The Association publishes the National Fire Codes(R) and the Learn Not to Burn(R) Curriculum. NFPA headquarters is in Quincy, Massachusetts, USA.

<P>SCHAUMBURG, Ill., May 2, 1996 -- Gone are the days when we send children outside to play to get a little color in their cheeks. We know too much about the dangers of unprotected sun exposure to hazard the development of skin cancer in our children. Or do we?</P>

<P>A recent survey conducted by the American Academy of Dermatology showed that 30% of parents with children under 13 reported that their children had a sunburn last summer. The same parents also reported having sunburn themselves.</P>

<P>Despite the fact that 58% of the parents remembered "hearing something in the past year" about protecting their children from the sun, children are still playing outside without sunscreen and sun-protective clothing.</P>

<P>"This speaks to a continued need to repeat sun safety messages until they are heard and integrated into everyone's behavior," commented dermatologist W. Mitchell W. Sams Jr., MD, President of the American Academy of Dermatology.</P>

<P>"Sunburn is the most preventable risk factor for skin cancer, including malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. We can't change our skin type or family history, but we can change our sunbathing habits. Parents should know that even one or two blistering sunburns can significantly increase a child's risk for developing melanoma/skin cancer later in life. Freckles aren't cute, they're a sign of sun damage."</P>

<P>This survey also revealed that 58% of young adults under 25 reported "working on a tan" as part of sports or other outdoor activities, and 26% said they "lay out in the sun." In fact, 49% of young adults under 25 reported having had a sunburn this past summer. Of the 1,009 adults polled, 62% said people look better with a tan."</P>

<P>Dr. Sams added: "Changing society's collective belief that being tanned connotes health and beauty continues to be a challenge. But by the year 2000, Americans will have a 1 in 75 lifetime risk of developing melanoma and other skin cancers. We have to replace that notion with the belief that staying out of the sun is smarter. It's never too late to change the odds."</P>

The American Academy of Dermatology recommends:

<ul>
<li>Stay out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

<br><br><li>Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of at least 15

<br><br><li>Reapply sunscreen every two hours, even on cloudy days

<br><br><li>Wear protective, tightly woven clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt and pants

<br><br><li>Wear a 4-inch wide broad-brimmed hat and sunglasses, with UV protective lenses

<br><br><li>Stay in the shade whenever possible. Avoid reflective surfaces, which can reflect up to 85% of the sun's damaging rays

<br><br><li> Protect children by keeping them out of the sun, minimizing sun exposure and applying sunscreens beginning at six months of age
</ul>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Does Giftedness Mean?</H3>

<P>Many parents say, "I know what giftedness is, but I can't put it into 
words." This generally is followed by reference to a particular child who 
seems to manifest gifted behaviors. Unfortunately, there are many 
misconceptions of the term, all of which become deterrents to 
understanding and catering to the needs of children identified as gifted. 
Let's study the following statement:</P>
<blockquote>

        "Giftedness is that precious endowment of 
        potentially outstanding abilities which allows 
        a person to interact with the environment 
        with remarkably high levels of achievement 
        and creativity." 
        </blockquote>

<P>This statement is the product of a small neighborhood group of parents 
who took a comprehensive view of the concept of giftedness before 
focusing on any attempt to define the gifted child. They thought, first, that 
within giftedness is a quality of innateness (or, as they said, "a gift 
conferred by nature"), and second, that one's environment is the arena in 
which the gifts come into play and develop. Therefore, they reasoned that 
the "remarkably high levels of achievement and creativity" result from a 
continuous and functional interaction between a person's inherent and 
acquired abilities and characteristics.</P>

<P>        We often hear statements such as "She's a born artist," or "He's a 
natural athlete," or conversely, "Success never came easy for me; I had to 
learn the hard way," or "He's a self-made man." Those who manifest 
giftedness obviously have some inherent or inborn factors plus the 
motivation and stamina to learn from and cope with the rigors of living.</P>

<P>        We suggest that you wrestle with the term in your own way, looking 
at giftedness as a concept that demands the investment of time, money, 
and energy. This will help you discuss giftedness more meaningfully with 
other parents, school administrators, school board members, or anyone 
who needs to understand the dynamics of the term.</P>

<a name="Who"></a>
<H3>Who Are Gifted Children?</H3>

<P>Former U. S. Commissioner of Education Sidney P. Marland, Jr., in his 
August 1971 report to Congress, stated, </P>

<blockquote>

        "Gifted and talented children are those identified by
        professionally qualified persons who by virtue of 
        outstanding abilities are capable of high performance. 
        These are children who require differentiated educational
        programs and/or services beyond those normally provided 
        by the regular school program in order to realize their
        contribution to self and society" (Marland, 1972). 
        </blockquote>

<P>        The same report continued:</P>

<blockquote>

        "Children capable of high performance include 
        those with demonstrated achievement and/or 
        potential ability in any of the following areas, 
        singly or in combination: 

<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI>general intellectual ability
        	<LI>specific academic aptitude
        	<LI>creative or productive thinking
        	<LI>leadership ability
        	<LI>visual or performing arts
        	<LI>psychomotor ability."
</UL>

</blockquote>
<P>        Using a broad definition of giftedness, a school system could expect 
to identify 10% to 15% or more of its student population as gifted and 
talented. A brief description of each area of giftedness or talent as defined 
by the Office of Gifted and Talented will help you understand this 
definition.</P>

<P>       <B> General intellectual ability or talent.</B>  Laypersons and educators alike 
usually define this in terms of a high intelligence test score--usually two 
standard deviations above the mean--on individual or group measures. 
Parents and teachers often recognize students with general intellectual 
talent by their wide-ranging fund of general information and high levels of 
vocabulary, memory, abstract word knowledge, and abstract reasoning.</P>

<P>     <B>Specific academic aptitude or talent.</B>  Students with specific academic 
aptitudes are identified by their outstanding performance on an 
achievement or aptitude test in one area such as mathematics or language 
arts. The organizers of talent searches sponsored by a number of 
universities and colleges identify students with specific academic aptitude 
who score at the 97th percentile or higher on standard achievement tests 
and then give these students the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). 
Remarkably large numbers of students score at these high levels.</P>

<P>        <B>Creative and productive thinking.</B>  This is the ability to produce new 
ideas by bringing together elements usually thought of as independent or 
dissimilar and the aptitude for developing new meanings that have social 
value. Characteristics of creative and productive students include openness 
to experience, setting personal standards for evaluation, ability to play 
with ideas, willingness to take risks, preference for complexity, tolerance 
for ambiguity, positive self-image, and the ability to become submerged in 
a task. Creative and productive students are identified through the use of 
tests such as the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking or through 
demonstrated creative performance.</P>

<P>       <B> Leadership ability.</B>  Leadership can be defined as the ability to direct 
individuals or groups to a common decision or action.  Students who 
demonstrate giftedness in leadership ability use group skills and negotiate 
in difficult situations. Many teachers recognize leadership through a 
student's keen interest and skill in problem solving. Leadership 
characteristics include self-confidence, responsibility, cooperation, a 
tendency to dominate, and the ability to adapt readily to new situations. 
These students can be identified through instruments such as the 
Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation Behavior (FIRO-B).</P>

<P>       <B> Visual and performing arts.</B>  Gifted students with talent in the arts 
demonstrate special talents in visual art, music, dance, drama, or other 
related studies.  These students can be identified by using task 
descriptions such as the Creative Products Scales, which were developed 
for the Detroit Public Schools by Patrick Byrons and Beverly Ness Parke of 
Wayne State University.</P>

<P>        <B>Psychomotor ability.</B>  This involves kinesthetic motor abilities such as 
practical, spatial, mechanical, and physical skills. It is seldom used as a 
criterion in gifted programs.</P>

<H3>Other Viewpoints</H3>

<P>Robert Sternberg and Robert Wagner (1982) have suggested that 
giftedness is a kind of mental self-management. The mental management 
of one's life in a constructive, purposeful way has three basic elements:  
adapting to environments, selecting new environments, and shaping 
environments. According to Sternberg and Wagner, the key psychological 
basis of intellectual giftedness resides in insight skills that include three 
main processes: (1) separating relevant from irrelevant information, (2) 
combining isolated pieces of information into a unified whole, and (3) 
relating newly acquired information to information acquired in the past.</P>

<P>        Sternberg and Wagner emphasized problem-solving abilities and 
viewed the gifted student as one who processes information rapidly and 
uses insight abilities. Howard Gardner (1983) also suggested a concept of 
multiple intelligences, stating that there are several ways of viewing the 
world: linguistic, logical/mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, 
interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligence.</P>

<P>        Joseph Renzulli (1986) stated that gifted behavior reflects an 
interaction among three basic clusters of human traits: above-average 
general and/or specific abilities, high levels of task commitment 
(motivation), and high levels of creativity. According to Renzulli, gifted and 
talented children are those who possess or are capable of developing this 
composite of traits and applying them to any potentially valuable area of 
human performance.</P>

<P>        A good source for pursuing the characteristics of giftedness in depth 
is Barbara Clark's informative book, GROWING UP GIFTED (1988), which 
presents an exhaustive list of characteristics under five major headings: 
Cognitive (thinking), Affective (feeling), Physical, Intuitive, and Societal.
        No one child manifests all of the attributes described by researchers 
and the Office of Gifted and Talented.  Nevertheless, it is important for 
parents to be fully aware of the ways in which giftedness can be 
recognized. Often, certain behaviors such as constantly having unique 
solutions to problems, asking endless, probing questions, or even the 
masterful manipulation of others are regarded by parents as unnatural, 
unlike other children, and trying to parental patience. Therefore, our 
recommendation is to study the characteristics of gifted children with an 
open mind. Do not use the list as a scorecard; simply discuss and appreciate 
the characteristics and let common sense, coupled with love, take over.</P>

<H3>A Quick Look At Intelligence</H3>

<P>The attempts to define giftedness refer in one way or another to so-called 
"inborn" attributes, which, for lack of a better term, are called intelligence. </P>

<P>Significant efforts have been made to measure intelligence, but, because 
the concept is elusive, test constructors simply aim at testing what they 
feel are typical manifestations of intelligence in behaviors.  Perhaps a little 
rhyme used for years by kindergarten teachers will help to describe this 
elusiveness:</P>

<P>        "Nobody sees the wind; neither you, nor I. 
        But when the trees bow down their heads, 
        the wind is passing by."</P>

<P>Just as we cannot see the wind, we cannot find, operate on, or transplant 
intelligence.  Yet we see the working or manifestations of intelligence in 
the behaviors of people.</P>

<P>        The man-made computation of an intelligence quotient, or IQ, is 
probably the best general indicator of intelligence, but in no way is it 
infallible. All too often, a child's IQ is misunderstood and becomes a 
lifelong "handle."  However, given our present knowledge, the results of a 
standardized intelligence test administered by a competent examiner 
provide as reliable an indication as possible of a person's potential ability 
to learn and cope. Until some scientific breakthrough is developed, we will 
rely on the IQ score to approximate how mentally gifted a person may be.</P>

<P>        The nature of intelligence was once explained in this way:</P>
        
<P>        If intelligence were something you could see, touch, and weigh, it 
would be something like a can of paint.  The genius would have a gallon, 
the person who has severe retardation, only half a pint.  The rest of us 
would have varying amounts between these extremes, with the majority 
possessing about two quarts.  This is clear enough, but it is only half the 
story.</P>

<P>        Each can of paint contains the same five or six ingredients in varying 
amounts.  One can may be "long" on oil, another on pigment, a third on 
turpentine, the fourth on gloss or drying agent. So, although two cans 
contain the same amount of paint, the paint may be of vastly different 
consistency, color, or character.</P>

<P>        Good painters want to know the elements in the paint with which 
they are working.  Parents and teachers want to know the kinds of 
intelligence with which they are working.  What are the special qualities of 
this intelligence?  In what proportions are these elements present?  Most 
important, how can these elements be used?</P>

<P>        We recommend that you do not become bogged down in probing into 
the concept of intelligence. Its intricacies and mysteries are fascinating, but 
it must not become a convenient synonym for giftedness.  An excellent 
coverage of the concept of intelligence is provided by Barbara Clark in 
GROWING UP GIFTED.</P>

<P>        The exciting advances in research on brain functioning, coupled with 
the realization that a child's intelligence is only one key to understanding 
giftedness, have underscored the importance of studying all characteristics 
of the gifted child.</P>

<a name="The"></a>
<H3>The Gifted Child Is Called Many Things</H3>

<P>Often parents are confused by the many terms used in referring to the 
gifted child. Many parents hear these terms used--sometimes adopting 
them in their own conversations--without knowing whether they are 
synonymous with "gifted" or are just words that help to explain the 
concept.</P>

<P>        The term "genius" used to be widely employed but now it is reserved 
for reference only to the phenomenally gifted person. "Talented" tends to 
be used when referring to a particular strength or ability of a person. 
Thought should be given to whether the talent is truly a gift or is, rather, 
an ability that has become a highly developed skill through practice. It is 
safe to say that generally the person identified as gifted is one who has 
multiple talents of a high order.</P>

<P>        The terms "prodigy" and "precocious" are most commonly used when 
a child evidences a decidedly advanced degree of skill in a particular 
endeavor at a very early age, as well as a very disciplined type of 
motivation. It is interesting to note that the derivation of the words 
precocious or precocity comes from the ancient Greek word for "precooked" 
and connotes the idea of early ripening.</P>

<P>        "Superior" is a comparative term. When a child is classified as 
"superior," we would like to know to whom, or what group, he or she is 
superior, and to what degree. A child may be markedly superior to the 
majority of children in a specific mental ability such as verbal 
comprehension and at the same time be equally inferior in spatial relations 
or memory. The looseness of the term limits its usage in most cases to 
broad generalization. A "high IQ" may be anything, depending on what it is 
higher than.</P>

<P>        "Rapid learner" is a helpful term in understanding giftedness, 
because it is a distinct characteristic manifested by the identified gifted 
child.</P>

<P>        The term "exceptional" is appropriate when referring to the gifted 
child as being different in the characteristics listed earlier.</P>

<P>        At this point it is important to bring into focus a term that continues 
to be tossed around altogether too loosely in reference to education of the 
gifted. That term is "elitism."</P>

<P>        By derivation, elite  means the choice, or best, or superior part of a 
body or class of persons. However, time and an overemphasis on 
egalitarianism have imparted a negative connotation to the word, implying 
snobbishness, selectivity, and unfair special attention.</P>

<P>        But in fact, gifted children are elite in the same way that anyone 
becomes a champion, a record-holder, a soloist, an inventor, or a leader in 
important realms of human endeavor. Therefore, their parents have a 
distinct responsibility to challenge those who cry "elitism" and explain to 
them the true meaning of the term.</P>

<P>        The only reason for mentioning these terms--and there are many 
more--is to caution parents that semantics and language usage can be 
tricky and confusing. Thus, your personal understanding and application of 
the term gifted  becomes doubly important.</P>

<P>Sara, who is 5 years old, listens as her 32-year-old father comments that 
today is her grandmother's 64th birthday. "Grandma's age is just twice my 
age," he observes.</P>

<P>        Although outwardly Sara does not seem to react to this information, 
her mind is whirling.  A few moments pass, and then the young girl 
excitedly replies, "You know Dad, you will only be 54 when your age is 
twice mine!"</P>

<P>        Sara has been intrigued by numbers and numerical relationships 
since she was very small.  At first this could be seen in the way she liked 
to count things and organize groups of objects.  She showed a fascination 
for calendars, telephone numbers, dates, ages, measurements, and almost 
anything else dealing with numbers.  Sara learned and remembered this 
information quickly and easily, but what was even more amazing was the 
way she played with and manipulated the information she was learning.  
She would carefully examine each idea and eagerly search to discover new, 
interesting, and unusual relationships and patterns.  Although Sara has had 
little formal instruction in mathematics, at the age of 5 she has acquired an 
incredible amount of mathematical knowledge and is amazingly 
sophisticated in using this knowledge to discover new ideas and solve 
problems.</P>

<P>        Sara is an example of a young child who is highly talented in the area 
of mathematics.  Like most individuals with this unusual talent, Sara 
exhibits characteristics and behaviors that are clues to her ability.  Some 
mathematically talented people radiate many or obvious clues, others offer 
only a few, or subtle ones.  Recognizing these clues is often an important 
first step in discovering an individual's high ability in mathematics.  It is 
difficult to believe, but many people with a high degree of mathematical 
talent have their talent underestimated or even unrecognized.  Their clues 
have gone unnoticed or ignored, and the true nature of their ability 
remains unexplored.  If Sara's talent in mathematics is to be discovered 
and appropriately nurtured, it is important that her parents and teachers 
recognize the clues.</P>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Should Parents and Teachers Know to Help Them Better Recognize Mathematical Talent?</H3>

<P>Mathematical talent refers to an unusually high ability to understand 
mathematical ideas and to reason mathematically, rather than just a high 
ability to do arithmetic computations or get top grades in mathematics.  
When considering mathematical talent, many people place too much 
emphasis on computational skill or high ability in replicating taught 
mathematical procedures.  Unless mathematical talent is correctly 
perceived, however, important clues can be overlooked and less important 
clues can be given too much significance.</P>

<P>        Some characteristics and behaviors that may yield important clues in discovering high mathematical talent are the following:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>An unusually keen awareness of and intense curiosity about numeric 
	information.
	<LI>An unusual quickness in learning, understanding, and applying 
	mathematical ideas.
	<LI>A high ability to think and work abstractly and the ability to see 
	mathematical patterns and relationships.
	<LI>An unusual ability to think and work with mathematical problems in 
	flexible, creative ways rather than in a stereotypic fashion.
	<LI>An unusual ability to transfer learning to new, untaught 
	mathematical situations.
</UL>

<P>Terms such as mathematically talented, mathematically gifted, and highly 
able in mathematics are generally used to refer to students whose 
mathematics ability places them in the top 2% or 3% of the population.  It 
is important to keep in mind the unusually high degree of talent that is 
being sought when looking for mathematically talented individuals.</P>

<P>Not all students who achieve the highest test scores or receive the highest 
grades in mathematics class are necessarily highly talented in 
mathematics.  Many of the mathematics programs in our schools are 
heavily devoted to the development of computational skills and provide 
little opportunity for students to demonstrate the complex types of 
reasoning skills that are characteristic of truly talented students.  The tests used and the grades given in such programs usually reflect that structure.  
Computational accuracy and conformity to taught procedures may be 
overemphasized, and the reasoning abilities associated with high ability in 
mathematics may be underemphasized.  In this type of environment, test 
scores and grades of less able students who are good in computation, 
attentive in class, willing to help, and conscientious about completing all 
assignments carefully in the prescribed manner will often be as high as the 
test scores and grades of students who are genuinely talented in 
mathematics.  While high achievement in school certainly can be a clue to 
high ability in mathematics, additional information is needed.  If care is 
not taken, students who are simply high achievers in mathematics can be 
mistakenly identified as mathematically talented.  It is just as important to 
avoid such incorrect identification as it is to identify students who are 
truly mathematically talented.</P>

<P>Some mathematically talented students do not demonstrate outstanding 
academic achievement, display enthusiasm toward school mathematics 
programs, or get top grades in mathematics class.  It is important to know 
that there are students like this, for their ability in mathematics is easily 
overlooked, even though they may exhibit other clues suggesting high 
ability in mathematics.  There are many possible reasons why these 
students do not do well, but often it is at least in part because of a 
mismatch between the student and the mathematics program.  Many of 
them refuse, or are unable, to conform to the expectations of programs that 
they see as uninteresting and inappropriate.  For their part, educators may 
not recognize the true ability of these students or see a need for adjusting 
the existing mathematics program.</P>

<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How Can Standardized Test Results Help In Recognizing Mathematical Talent?</H3>

<P><B>Intelligence Tests</B>.  IQ test results often yield valuable information and 
may provide clues to the existence of mathematical talent.  Used alone, 
however, these tests are not sufficient to identify high ability in 
mathematics.  Mathematical talent is a specific aptitude, while an IQ score 
is a summary of many different aptitudes and abilities.  An individual's IQ 
is made up of several different components, only some of which relate to 
mathematical ability.  Suppose two students have the same IQ scores.  One 
of them could have a high score in mathematical components and a low 
score in verbal components, while the other is just the opposite.  The first 
student would be likely have to much greater mathematics ability than the 
second, even though they have the same overall IQ.  Children with high 
IQ's--no matter how high the score--cannot be assumed to be 
mathematically talented.  It could be a clue, but more information is 
needed.</P>

<P><B>Creativity Tests</B>.  There are differing opinions on how the results of 
creativity tests can be used to help identify high ability in mathematics.  
Although mathematically talented students display creativity when 
dealing with mathematical ideas, this is not always apparent in creativity 
test results.  However, high creativity assessments, along with indications 
of intense interest in mathematics, do seem to be a significant clue of 
mathematical talent.</P>

<P><B>Mathematics Achievement Tests</B>.  Mathematics achievement tests also can provide valuable clues in identifying high ability in mathematics, but the 
results of these tests have to be interpreted carefully.  Mathematics 
achievement tests are often computation-oriented and give little 
information about how a student actually reasons mathematically.  Also, 
the tests seldom have enough difficult problems to appropriately assess 
the upper limits of a talented student's ability or show that this ability is 
qualitatively different from that of other very good, but not truly 
mathematically talented, students.  If these limitations are kept in mind, 
the results of mathematics achievement tests can be useful.  Students 
scoring above the 95th or 97th percentiles on national norms may have 
high ability in mathematics, but more information is needed to separate 
the high achievers from the truly gifted.  It should not be assumed that 
there are no mathematically talented students among those scoring below 
the 95th percentile; those students will have to be recognized from other 
clues.</P>

<P><B>Mathematics Aptitude Tests</B>.  Standardized mathematics aptitude test 
results should be used in basically the same way that the results of mathematics achievement tests are used.  Aptitude tests have some of the same 
limitations as achievement tests except that, because they are designed to 
place less emphasis on computational skills and more emphasis on 
mathematical reasoning skills, the results from these tests are often more 
useful in identifying mathematically talented students.</P>

<P><B>Out-of-Grade-Level Mathematics Aptitude Tests</B>.  Many of the limitations associated with mathematics aptitude tests can be reduced by 
administering out-of-grade-level versions of the tests.  This process should 
be used only with students who already have demonstrated strong 
mathematics abilities on regular-grade-level instruments or those who 
show definite signs of high mathematics ability.  An out-of-grade-level 
mathematics aptitude test is a test that is usually designed for and used 
with students about one and one-third times the age of the child being 
tested.  For example, a 9-year-old third grader would be tested using an 
abilities test normally written for 12-year-old sixth graders.  This gives a 
much better assessment of mathematical reasoning skills because the 
student must find ways to solve problems, many of which he or she has 
not been taught to do.  These tests have many difficult problems that will 
challenge even the most capable students, thus making it possible to 
discriminate the truly talented from others who are just very good in 
mathematics.</P>

<P>        The out-of-grade-level testing procedure has been used successfully 
in several mathematics talent searches and school mathematics programs 
with junior and senior high school students over the past 15 years.  More 
recently, there have been programs that have successfully used the 
procedure in the elementary grades.</P>

<a name="Systematic"></a>
<H3>What Systematic Process Can Be Used To Identify Mathematically Talented Students?</H3>

<P>Correctly identifying mathematically talented students is not a simple task, and there is more than one way to go about it.  Some common features of 
successful identification processes are combined in the following model.  
This model is intended to be implemented with a degree of flexibility in 
order to give mathematically talented students every opportunity to have 
their talent discovered.  This may be especially important when looking for 
mathematical talent in minority or disadvantaged populations.</P>

<H4>Phase One: Screening</H4>

<P>The objective in phase one is to establish a group of students suspected of 
having high ability in mathematics.  These students will be evaluated 
further in the next phase.  In phase one, effort attempt should be made not 
to miss potentially talented students.</P>

<P><B>Step One</B>.  An identification checklist (Figure 1) should be set up to record 
the names of students thought to have high ability in mathematics along 
with the clues that suggest their talent.  Students scoring above the 95th 
percentile on a mathematics aptitude test are entered first.  Next, those 
scoring above the 95th percentile on mathematics achievement tests who 
are not already on the list are added.  If a student's name is already on the 
list, the test score is simply added to that student's record.  In a like 
manner, students who are mentally gifted; students who are creative and 
have high interest in mathematics; and students nominated by parents, 
teachers, self, or peers can be added.</P>

<BR>
<P><B>Step Two</B>.  The checklist information for each student should be reviewed.  
If the information collected for a particular student suggests that out-of-
grade-level testing is not advisable, that student's name should be 
removed, because phase two testing may damage the egos of students who 
do not really excel in mathematics.  However, caution should be exercised 
not to eliminate talented students in this process. Parent involvement in 
these decisions is recommended.</P>

<H4>Phase Two: Out-of-Grade-Level Mathematics Abilities Assessment</H4>

<P>The objective in phase two is to separate the mathematically talented 
students from those who are merely good students in mathematics and to 
begin assessing the extent of the ability of the mathematically talented 
students.</P>

<P><B>Step One</B>.  Students who are scheduled to take the out-of-grade-level test, along with their parents, should be informed about the nature of this test and the reason it is being given.  The out-of-grade-level test would then be administered with student and parent consent.  Figure 2 provides a sample 
schedule for such testing.</P>

</CENTER>


<BR>
<P><B>Step Two</B>.  The results of each student's out-of-grade-level test should be evaluated in conjunction with the results of phase one screening.  
Generally, the student's out-of-grade-level score will be an indication of 
degree of mathematical talent.  Scores above the 74th percentile represent 
a degree of mathematical talent similar to that of students identified in 
regional talent searches such as the one conducted by Johns Hopkins 
University.  This level of talent places the student in the upper 1% of the 
population in mathematics ability.  Scores above the 64th percentile 
denote a level of talent that most likely places the student in the upper 3% 
of the population.  Students in these two groups would be identified as 
mathematically talented.</P>

<a name="Instructional"></a>
<H3>What Instructional Approaches Benefit Mathematically Talented Students?</H3>

<P>Students identified as mathematically talented vary greatly in degree of 
talent and motivation.  No single approach is best for all of these students.  
The design of each student's instructional program in mathematics should 
be based on an analysis of individual abilities and needs.  For example, 
students with extremely high ability and motivation may profit more from 
a program that promotes rapid and relatively independent movement 
through instructional content.  Students with less ability or lower 
motivation may do better in a program that is not paced so quickly and is 
more deliberate in developing the mathematical concepts being taught.  
There are some common features, however, that seem to be important 
ingredients in the mathematics programs of mathematically talented 
students.</P>

<P>The program should bring mathematically talented students together to 
work with one another in the area of mathematics.  Students will benefit 
greatly, both academically and emotionally, from this type of experience.  
They will learn from each other, reinforce each other, and help each other 
over difficulties.</P>

<P>The program should stress mathematical reasoning and develop 
independent exploratory behavior.  This type of program is exemplified by 
discovery learning, looking for underlying principles, engaging in special 
projects in mathematics, problem solving, discovering formulas, looking for 
patterns, and organizing data to find relationships.</P>

<P>The mathematics program should deemphasize repetitious computational 
drill work and cyclical review.  This type of work in mathematics should 
be minimal for all mathematically talented students.  As ability in 
mathematics increases, the benefits to be gained from this type of activity 
decrease.</P>

<P>The scope of the mathematics curriculum should be extensive so that it 
will provide an adequate foundation for students who may become 
mathematicians in the future.  In many programs the mathematics 
curriculum will have to be greatly expanded to meet this need.</P>

<P>The mathematics program should be flexibly paced.  Flexibly paced means 
that students are placed at an appropriate instructional level on the basis 
of an assessment of their knowledge and skill.  Each student is then 
allowed to progress at a pace limited only by his or her ability and 
motivation.  Flexible pacing can be achieved in the following ways:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Continuous progress.  Students receive appropriate instruction daily and move ahead as they master content and skill.
	
	<LI>Compacted course.  Students complete two or more courses in an 
abbreviated time.

	<LI>Advanced-level course.  Students are presented with course content normally taught at a higher grade.
	
	<LI>Grade skipping.  Students move ahead 1 or more years beyond the next level of promotion.
	
	<LI>Early entrance.  Students enter elementary school, middle school, high school, or college earlier than the usual age.
	
	<LI>Concurrent or dual enrollment.  Students at one school level take classes at another school level.  For example, an elementary school student may take classes at the middle school.
	
	<LI>Credit by examination.  Students receive credit for a course upon satisfactory completion of an examination or upon certification of mastery.<BR><BR>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>The fate of Sara and other mathematically talented students will be 
determined largely by the ability of their parents and educators to 
discover and nurture their special ability.  The notion that these students 
will achieve their potential anyway is constantly refuted.  For too many 
students like Sara, lack of appropriate mathematical nourishment seems to 
be the rule rather than the exception.  At risk are the benefits that these 
children might gain from early advancement and the attitudes that these 
children will have toward mathematics, school, learning in general, and 
themselves.  By discovering the mathematical talent of these students and 
using that knowledge to provide appropriate academic nurture, we have 
the greatest chance to help these individuals reach their gifted potential.</P>

<p>
 MINNEAPOLIS, April 26, 1996-- Moore Data Management Services, a unit of Moore Corporation Limited of Toronto, has entered into a strategic alliance with SchoolMatch of Westerville, Ohio, to exclusively  provide realtors with high quality auditable school information frequently requested by home buyers. SchoolMatch compiles and continuously updates data on all U.S. public school systems, as well as private and parochial schools, and American-accredited international schools in over 60 countries. Moore will immediately begin licensirg SchoolMatch data and will market the service directly to real estate brokers in the United States and Canada through its new Broker Services Group sales organization.</p>

<p>
 According to John W. Mosey, vice president of sales for Moore Data Management Services, SchoolMatch gives brokers a powerful tool as well as a distinct advantage in the highly competitive real estate marketplace. &quot;Whether a family is relocating to a new city, or simply desires to purchase a new home in the same area, one of the most important considerations in the moving process is the match between the community's schools and their children's  needs,&quot; says Mosey. &quot;Brokers who are able to provide a value-added service and whose agents act in the role of counselor in this crucial decision will forge stronger relationships with both buyers and sellers. SchoolMatch can help them gain listings as well as attract buyers because the service can be offered to both incoming and outbound families.&quot;</p>
<p>
 Moore will license the SchoolMatch database to the real estate broker and provide updates on a subscription basis; the database is installed on the broker's computer and can be networked and accessed across all affiliated offices to request reports. Reports include national percentile ranks in important categories. Comparative information is available for all public and private schools, so it is possible to find a school system that mirrors' a client's favorite, or a client can benchmark a known schooling alternative.</p>
<p>
 William L. Bainbridge, president of SchoolMatch, says that the data are all auditable, collected from official agency, county and state records, and this protects Realtors from liability, or claims of &quot;steering.&quot; &quot;The availability of this data puts decision making in the hands of the parents, where it belongs. They tell you what their parameters are, what's important to them and their child,&quot; says Bainbridge, &quot;including such things as class size, tuition, availability of financial aid, competition for admission, number of faculty with advanced degrees, availability of course  offerings, special education programs offered. We also provide community data such as per capita income of residents, housing values, prospective neighbors' education levels and percentage of school-age children. Within 24 hours, the agent has a comprehensive, yet user-friendly, report indicating the most compatible schools in the acceptable area to give to the client.&quot;</p>
<p>
 In this age of the global village, corporate restructuring and relocation, SchoolMatch has gained widespread recognition in the media. The service has been featured in articles in Business Week, Parents, Newsweek, U.S. News &amp; World Report, Better Homes and Gardens, Good Housekeeping, Working Mother and Money magazines, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, as well as segments on the NBC  TODAY show, CNN, CBS  and NPR. Real estate brokers who subscribe to the service also attest to
its effectiveness  </p> 

<P>George V. Smith, president of HER Realtors(R) in Columbus, Ohio, who was recently named "committee chairman of the year" by the National Association of Realtors says,"Most people think that all Realtors are created equal -- that's not true. SchoolMatch provides a competitive advantage to the brokers who have it -- and use it! After we demonstrated to our agent associates all of the advantages of SchoolMatch' and they began using the service, HER set corporate sales records in each of the past few years. SchoolMatch has contributed to our success by playing a dominant role in providing our clients a service they need and want."</P>

<P>"The agreement is a win-win-win situation," says Mosey. "Moore has the in-depth knowledge of the real estate industry to assist brokers in growing their business and to market this service effectively, SchoolMatch provides a superior product to offer our customers, and brokers have access to a cutting-edge tool to compete effectively in their market."</P>

<P>Moore Corporation Limited (NYSE: MCL; Toronto, Montreal] is a global leader in delivering information handling products and services that create efficiency and enhance competitiveness for customers, including business forms and systems, business equipment, print management outsourcing, commercial and digital printing, labels, personalized direct mail, statement printing, and related services.

And if a woman has a high incidence of ovarian or breast cancer in her family,there could be an 85 percent chance she or her daughters will also get the disease.</P><P> According to Dr. Lori Jardines, assistant professor of surgery at Medical College of Pennsylvaniaand Hahnemann University and director of breast surgery at Medical College of Pennsylvania Hospital,talking to your daughter about her breast health could be her key to early detection and possiblyeven save her life.</P><P> Dr. Jardines suggests that mothers start with breast health maintenance education. &quot;Mothersshould teach their daughters about breast self examination and how and when to do them,&quot; shesays.</P><P> According to Or. Jardines, young women should be doing breast self exams by age 20 in order forthem to become familiar with their bodies. &quot;Even though it is unlikely that women of this agewill get breast cancer and lumps in teenagers are mostly benign,&quot; she says, &quot;learning howto do self exams will teach young women to know their bodies and catch any problems early." </P><P> Learning about breast health with their mothers can also help allay young women's fears. Motherscan teach their daughters about risk and the importance of early detection, especially lf they'veexperienced any breast health problems themselves. For example, if a woman finds a lump in herbreast, she could show her daughter and let her feel it, so she knows what a potentially problem lumpreally feels like.</P><P> Teaching daughters about mammograms and other preventive measures is also a good ideaaccording to Jardines. Some mothers even feel comfortable bringing their daughter with them when theyget a mammogram.</P><P> &quot;This could help demystify the concept and take away the fear of the unknown. They can seethat it doesn't hurt and it's not frightening. This will help the next generation realize that havingmammograms is part of being a woman just like gynecological examinations,&quot; says Dr.Jardines.</P><P> The mammogram, though, is only one part of what Dr. Jardines calls a &quot;three-prongapproach&quot; to breast cancer prevention. In addition to mammograms, women of all ages should dobreast self exams and have clinical breast exams by a health care professional. Also, mothers anddaughters together should maintain a healthy lifestyle which includes exercise and low-fat diet.</P><P> CONTACT Merrill S.

This pilot study is the first long-term studyof its kind andappears in the April issue of Archives of Ophthalmology.</P><P> &quot;We followed 8 preterm patients who received cryotherapy atapproximately 12 weeks ofage,&quot; said Graham E. Quinn, M.D., Associate Surgeon, Division ofOphthalmology at The Children'sHospital of Philadelphia. All of the babies enrolled received cryotherapy inone eye, leaving theother eye to serve as a control. Dr. Quinn and his associates at Philadelphia'sChildren's Hospitaland Wills Eye Hospital then followed the patients, testing their vision on anannual basis.&quot;Today, the children are able to see and read letters,&quot; said Dr.Quinn. &quot;However, in atest of the child's ability to detect an object off to the side while the childlooked straightahead, we found a deficit in peripheral vision of approximately 10percent,&quot; Dr. Quinn said.</P><P> In order to test peripheral vision, a Goldmann projection perimeter testwas used when thepatient reached at least 6 years of age. This test projects a lighted targetonto a screen thatsurrounds the child's head. When the target became visible, the child was toldto push a buzzer,ending the test. The distance from the child's central sight line to where thetarget was spotted wasthen measured, providing a calculation of the child's peripheral vision.</P><P> "Without question, there is a price to pay for using cryotherapy,&quot;said Dr. Quinn. ~However,without the surgical intervention, we would see more children with severe ROPgo blind. When youweigh the two outcomes -- sight with a small loss of side vision versusblindness - cryotherapyappears to be the best option in premature infants diagnosed with severeROP.</P><P> Each year, more than 4,000 babies born in the United States develop theprogressive eye diseasecalled ROP. Those at greatest risk are premature infants weighing less than 3.3pounds or born beforethe eighth month of pregnancy. For those babies whose ROP progresses to asevere level, there is a 50percent chance the damage will be so great the infant will become legallyblind.</P><P> The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Division of Ophthalmology servedas the PhiladelphiaCenter for the multicenter trial of cryotherapy for retinopathy of prematuritysponsored by theNational Eye Institute. A total of 268 patients were enrolled at Children'sHospital to determinewhether a surgical procedure that freezes the inside lining of the eyeballcould stop the disease'sdevastating course.</P><P> During the delicate surgery, a probe is placed on the surface of the eye,freezing through to theretinas. Dr. Quinn and his associates believe the cold temperature of the probedestroys cells withinthe retina responsible for producing irregular growth of blood vessels alongthe retina's surface.The abnormal blood vessels contribute to scarring and the scar tissuecontinually tugs on theretina's surface.</P><P> Ultimately, this constant tugging may detach the retina from the wall ofthe eye, leaving thechild blind.</P><P> The Philadelphia Center results were then analyzed along with results from22 other centersacross the nation in an effort led by Earl A. Falmer, M.D., of Oregon HealthSciences University.According to Dr. Quinn, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's investigationof peripheral visionand the National Eye Institute's follow-up study of cryotherapy for ROP willhelp Ophthalmologists and parents alike. &quot;This is important information for us to know,&quot;said Or. Quinn. ~Whenyou have a child who is at high risk for going blind and there is an optionthat markedly lowers therisk of blindness, it is important to be able to explain to parents how thisoption comes with itsown risk,~ he said. &quot;We now know that one of the risks associated withcryotherapy is arelatively small loss of peripheral vision.&quot;</P><P> Working with Dr. Quinn on the visual field study were: Dr. David Schaffer,Chairman of theDepartment of Ophthalmology at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; WilliamTasman, M.D., and J.Arch McNamara, M.D., of Wills Eye Hospital, and Dennis Miller and Janice Evansof Children'sHospital. In addition, the following collaborated with Dr. Quinn on theNational Eye Institute study:Richard Hertle, M.C., Martin Wilson, M.D., Sheryl Menacker, M.D., all with theDepartment ofOphthalmology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Jay Kubacki, M.D. ofSt. Christopher's andGary Brown, M.D. of Wills Eye Hospital</P><P> The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the nation's first children'shospital, is a leader inpatient care, education and research. This 304-bed multispecialty hospitalprovides comprehensivepediatric services to children from birth through age 19.</P><p>Contact:  Sarah Jarvis of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,215-590-4092. </p></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4><a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> |<a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |<A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |<a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center><img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left><address>We love to talk with you.

<P>WASHINGTON, April 10 -- For kids in America today, the life-threatening childhood diseases their parents feared are generally unknown because of this nation's success In vaccination, according to a survey just completed for Merck &#38; Co., Inc. When asked to rate the importance of certain technological advances to their own lives, children and adults overwhelmingly put medicine and vaccines at the very top of the list, over cars, television and computer games.</P>

<P>Public Opinion Strategies (Alexandria, Virginia) was commissioned by Merck to conduct a national telephone survey of 600 adults ages 40 and over and 600 children, ages 8 to 12. It is the first national survey to actually question children about their attitudes toward getting shots and to measure their understanding of vaccines and the diseases they prevent.</P>

<P>"What's clear is that with the success of our immunization programs, vaccines have reduced the fear of these diseases among adults -- and even name recognition among children," William Atkinson, M.D., a medical epidemiologist with the National Immunization Program at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), said today at a press conference releasing the survey findings.</P>

<P>Parents believe that vaccines have made it safer for their children, the survey shows. Among adults, concerns about measles, mumps and rubella have definitely diminished over time, since the introduction of a vaccine. Concern over measles, which 74% of adults feel are "life-threatening," dropped a full point, from a mean score of 3.2 on a scale of 5, to 2.2, with 5 being the greatest level of concern.</P>

<P>Most kids today say they have not even heard the words "measles," "mumps" or "rubella" and even fewer say they know what the words mean, the survey shows. Eighty-four percent of girls (81%, boys) say they have never heard of rubella, a disease that can be disastrous in early pregnancy, leading to fetal death, premature delivery and congenital defects, including deafness and blindness. Only approximately 3% say they know what it means, with definitions ranging from "A disease" (girl, age 10) to "Measles except it is worse" (girl, age 12).</P>

<P>Sixty-five percent of children say they know what "measles" is, but their definitions most often are nonspecific -- like 'red spots" (42%) or "like chickenpox" (28%). Chickenpox, a disease for which there was no vaccine available in the U.S. until last year, by far is the best known of the illnesses tested, with 95% of kids reporting that they have some Idea of what it is.</P>

<P>Kids have a good understanding of why they got shots and that it is in their best interest to do so, the survey shows. Eighty-two percent say they should get shots 'so I don't get sick"; the next closest response (15%) was that they need to got shots to go to school.</P>

<P>But less than half (40%) of all children ages 8 to 12 can define what a vaccine is or how vaccines work to prevent disease. Definitions include: "A special shot." (girl, age 8); "It's where they stick a needle in your arm, and I think they put water into your body." (boy, age 9); "It's like some kind of deodorant or something like that.' (boy, age 10); "It's a shot or medicine you take to stop you from getting sick. It usually lasts five to ten years." (boy, age 11); "You get a small amount of the disease injected into your body and it fights it off." (girl, age 12). Knowledge of the term "vaccine" Is definitely related to the age of the child, with only 13% of eight year olds saying they know what it is, compared to fully 61% of 12 year olds.</P>

<P>"Clearly, there Is a much bigger role for children as partners in prevention in America, along with parents, physicians and the public health system," said R. Gordon Douglas, Jr., M.D., President of Merck Vaccines. "The challenge is for children to understand the value of vaccines in context -- as a powerful weapon in an ongoing battle to prevent disease."</P>

<P>Twenty-five years of national immunization programs with a combination vaccine for three childhood diseases -- measles, mumps and rubella ("German measles") -- have all but dropped morbidity and mortality for these diseases off the charts, according to Dr. Atkinson. Yet the survey shows that while parents appreciate the role of vaccines in preventing these diseases, they underestimate what a dramatic difference they actually have made.</P>

<P>For example, only 12% say that the vaccine for measles has reduced the incidence of the disease by 95% or more, with 14% estimating the decrease is less than 49%. In fact, according to the CDC, morbidity and mortality rates have declined by 99.9% for measles -- 288 cases with no deaths in 1995, compared to 500,000 cases and 500 deaths annually before the vaccine was introduced in 1963.</P>

<P>The survey also illustrates that parents are not telling their children about the serious nature of these childhood diseases. A majority of kids say that getting one of these diseases would only make someone .. moderately sick" or "not very sick."</P>

<P>AIDS and cancer top the wish list of now vaccines for both children and adults in the study - AIDS/HIV is mentioned by 24% of children and 62% of adults; cancer by 11% of children and 38% of adults.</P>

<P>     WASHINGTON, April 11 -- What if your 9-year-old child is diagnosed with leukemia? Will you know where to go for the best care? The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) today announced the establishment of an unprecedented, state-of-the-art Pediatric Cancer Network that can help answer those difficult questions.</P>

<P>     Through the Network, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans and their subscribers will have immediate access to the beat pediatric cancer care, coordinating the highest quality options and most cutting-edge treatment available in America today. The Network will also generate valuable outcomes data to be used by the medical and scientific community to define new treatments and move toward now cures.</P>

<P>     The Pediatric Cancer Network initiative is supported by several national organizations with a role in cancer care for children:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>The National Cancer Institute 
     	<LI>Leading children's cancer treatment organizations, including the Children's Cancer Group, the Pediatric Oncology Group and the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology 
     	<LI>Children's hospitals and health systems represented by the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions 
     	<LI>The Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation, a nationally recognized patient and family advocacy organization 
</UL>

<P>     "We know that the odds for children with cancer can be greatly improved with highly specialized, multi-disciplinary care provided under the direction of pediatric oncologists," Said Pat Hays, BCBSA president and CEO. "Our independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans throughout the United States will encourage physicians and their patients to use the Pediatric Cancer Network centers. We also encourage other managed care companies to adopt the model of the Pediatric Cancer Network."</P>

<P>     The Pediatric Cancer Network is built on the scientifically established finding that children's survival rates can be significantly improved -- anywhere from 20 to 40 percent -- if their cancer care is coordinated by pediatric oncologists and delivered at comprehensive, multi-disciplinary cancer centers.</P>

<P>     "The Network removes barriers to special care, ensuring the young cancer patient receives the most cutting edge treatment,' Hays Said.</P>

<P>     Every hospital that seeks to become a Pediatric Cancer Network center must meet strict quality-based facility standards derived from nationally recognized guidelines and undergo a thorough on-site review. In most cases, these Network Centers participate in cooperative, multi-institutional clinical trials, which are helping to define new treatment protocols and keep science moving forward in search of cures.</P>

<P>     According to the Network model, 80 percent of the child's care, from definitive diagnosis to the completion of active treatment, would be delivered in a Network center. A board-certified pediatric oncologist would coordinate every phase of the child's treatment with a top-notch team of specialists and caregivers. The remaining 20 percent of the child's care, which includes early diagnosis and post-treatment care, would be provided by the family's own physician under the direction of the center.</P>

<P>     "One of our central goals for the Network Is to improve children's cancer care for today and for tomorrow," Hays said. 'By pooling our knowledge and evaluating our outcomes, we'll continue to see the kinds of breakthroughs that offer children with cancer real hope."</P>

<P>The Pediatric Cancer Network is the first of its kind in the industry, but it is not the first "centers of excellence" network offered by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield System. The Blues have previously developed national networks for highly specialized services including organ transplantation and bone marrow transplantation.</P>

<P>"We are confident that the Pediatric Cancer Network will be successful and will become a care-delivery model for the entire health insurance industry," said Susan Gleason, BCBSA vice president, Health Management Systems. "We believe the Pediatric Cancer Network represents the best in managed care and Is a great example of how the managed care industry and the medical community can work together.</P>

<P>"It's our goal for this to become the premier network in the country to manage the diagnosis and treatment of today's young cancer victims,' Gleason added. "We're proud to have the support of the pediatric oncology community as we work toward that goal."</P>

<P>The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Is an association of 63 locally operated, independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans, collectively insuring I in 4 Americans, 30 million of whom are enrolled In managed care programs.</P>

<P>PHILADELPHIA, April 11 -- Children under the age of five are in danger of suffering serious injury or even death as a result of accidental poisonings. While adults can read warning labels an household products and medications, children have no idea what these labels mean, and as a result, cannot distinguish between substances that are harmful and those that are not.</P>

<P>In an effort to help children learn about what poisons look like, what forms they come in and how they could be hurt by them, a new Healthy Lifestyles program called "Poison Proof" was created by a partnership between Independence Blue Cross, Pennsylvania Blue Shield and Keystone Health Plan East in conjunction with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and the Poison Control Center. It is part of a series of wellness initiatives spearheaded by the company's Preventive Health Services department.</P>

<P>A key component of the program is a specially designed sticker featuring "Mr. Yuk," as well as the name and telephone number of the Poison Control Center should an emergency occur. Mr. Yuk's frown and negative expression indicate to children that the product it is affixed to is not desirable to ingest. While the classic skull and crossbones symbol is very effective for adults, to children this warning means nothing, and in fact could even signal to a child that the item is okay to chew or swallow.</P>

<P>"It's simply not enough to teach children to keep away from areas where dangerous products are stored," said C. Fred DiBona, president and CEO of Independence Blue Cross. "Even though a child may keep away from the medicine cabinet they can still eat an aspirin from their mother's purse, drink drain cleaner from a bottle left on a counter, or ingest gas left in a bright container in the garage or backyard."</P>

<P>DiBona added that the program grew out of an alarming realization that poisonings among young children are on the rise. In fact in the Philadelphia area alone, there were more than 22,450 more cases of child poisonings during 1995, and so far this year more than 4,000 have been reported.</P>

<P>In addition to the children's stickers, the program includes a series of flash cards that help adults teach children under age five the types of poisons they might encounter, as well as what the containers that hold these dangerous products look like. The cards instruct children to ask an adult before touching, smelling or tasting items in their home, or others that they might encounter in the playground or in school.</P>

<P>According to the Poison Control Center, more than 90% of poisonings are accidental and occur in the home. Common household products such as cleansers, detergents, cosmetics, mouthwash and even plants are involved in more than 50 percent of all poisoning. Forty-seven percent of poisonings reported come from common pharmaceutical products -- cough and cold medicines, vitamins and prescription drugs.</P>

<P>DiBona added that parents can prevent poisonings in the home by following some very simple guidelines:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Store cleaners, medicines, cosmetics and other substances out of children's reach. Keep products in their original containers and do not put cleaners in food or drink storage containers 
	<LI>Never call medicine "candy" and do not take medicines in front of children 
	<LI>Place safety latches on all drawer or cabinets containing harmful products and use child resistant packages. Have one ounce of syrup of Ipecac per child in the home at all times, and post the Poison Control Center and other emergency numbers by the telephone 
	<LI>Never administer Ipecac without instructions from a doctor or the Poison Control Center 
	<LI>Place the Mr. Yuk stickers on poisonous chemicals so children will know to stay away from them and teach children what the Mr. Yuk symbol means 
	<LI>Remain calm should a poisoning occur and call the Poison Control Center at 800-722-7112 outside Philadelphia and 215-386-2100 in the city 
</UL>

<P>For more information on how to enroll in the Poison Proof program, call Independence Blue Cross Healthy Lifestyles Service Team at 800-916-7700. In addition to quantities of the Mr. Yuk sticker, recipients will receive a coupon entitling them to a free syrup of Ipecac, Poison Safety Checklist, which helps inventory poisonous materials in the home, in addition to a Poison Control Brochure that identifies poisonous items found in the home and recommendations for eliminating their exposure to children.</P>

<P>Independence Blue Cross, headquartered in Philadelphia, PA, is one of the largest Blue Cross Plans in the U.S. serving more than 2.2 million members in the five-county Southeastern Pennsylvania region. IBC and its subsidiary operations had more than $2.3 billion in operating income, $50 million in investment income and $32.5 million in not operating income.</P>

<P>In partnership with Pennsylvania Blue Shield the company created one of the nation's fastest growing HMOs, Keystone Health Plan East. In 1995, Keystone was granted full-accreditation by the National Council of Quality Assurance, an important designation for its 582,000 members. IBC also launched its popular Personal Choice product which has seen tremendous growth in the last two-and-a half years with more than 440,000 members, and in 1995 the company expanded into New Jersey and Delaware with a wholly-owned subsidiary, AmeriHealth, with more than 47,000 members. The company also provides a variety of benefit programs for low-income and uninsured populations including children and individuals on medical assistance.</P>

<P>BOSTON, April 10 -- The National Pediculosis Association (NPA) today applauded the FDA's new recommended labeling changes for childhood lice treatments containing the pesticide lindane, a chemical identified as a hazardous substance by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry of the U.S. Department of Health and Health and Human Services. At the same time, the NPA continues to warn parents and pediatricians of the "grave" implications of using any lindane-based products -- citing a growing body of evidence that the product can cause serious and sometimes fatal conditions.</P>

<P>"In its statement, the FDA advised that lindane be a treatment of last resort -- its own acknowledgment that this pesticide can carry serious risks," said NPA President Deborah Altschuler. "The reports we have been receiving indicate that these risks are more widespread than previously acknowledged, and that in certain cases, the adverse effects in lindane outweigh the risks of having lice. In particular, pregnant or nursing women should never be exposed to any of the lice pesticides, even as a last resort."</P>

<P>There are as many as 12 million cases of lice within the United States each year, with most involving children. Over &#36;100 million are spent on lice treatment products on an annual basis.</P>

<P>The FDA has recommended labeling changes that encourage lindane's use only for patients who have either failed to respond to adequate doses, or are intolerant of, other approved therapies."Altschuler noted two of the problems that remain despite this recommendation:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Parents predictably use lindane among other head lice and scabies treatments in hazardous ways even after reading directions -- leaving them on too long; applying them too often; or applying them to those who are inherently at risk.

	<LI>"Reports of treatment failure with often used products such as NIX Creme Rinse and RID, are increasing at an alarming rate," Altschuler said. "We are receiving up to 50 calls a day from frustrated parents, as well public health and medical professionals, reporting possible lice resistance. Parents perceive lice treatments as shampoos, rather than pesticides. They try the same treatments again and again, often switching from one product to another. Such ineffective overexposure renders children that much more vulnerable to "mop-up" treatments with lindane, as recommended in the FDA statement," she said.
</UL>

<P>Since May 1994, when it opened its National Registry for reporting adverse events related to lice and scabies treatment products, the NPA has received and submitted over 500 adverse event reports to the FDA's Med Watch Program -- approximately two-thirds of which were related to the use of lindane. The reports include seizures, behavioral changes, neuromuscular complaints, attention deficit disorders, chronic skin eruptions, cancer and death.</P>

<P>The NPA's mission is to protect children from the misuse of potentially harmful lice and scabies pesticidal treatments. Incorporated in 1983, the NPA is the only non-profit health education agency established to build awareness of head lice prevention and to help standardize head lice control policies nationwide. As part of its mission, the NPA utilizes the head lice issue as an early opportunity to teach children responsible personal health behaviors. The NPA is currently sponsoring a treatment study to investigate possible lice resistance. The study is being conducted at the Harvard School of Public Health.</P>

<P>"Moreover, physicians are not attunded to parental misuse, and are not looking for possible symptoms following lindane treatment, be they initially subtle or pronounced," she added.  In previous testimony before the FDA on this issue, the NPA urged that "endemic status of lice among America's children dictates that lice treatment exposure be part of routine history taking."</P>

<P>To report product treatment failures, community outbreaks of lice or scabies, or adverse reactions to products, individuals can call the NPA registry at 800-446-4NPA. NPA offers suggestions for those experiencing head lice treatment failure. To receive these suggestions and/or a lice or scabies brochure, send a self-addressed stamped envelope along with your request to NPA, P.D. Box 610189, Newton, MA 02161-0189. NPA also offers recorded educational messages on lice and scabies available 24 hours a day by calling 617-449-6487.</P>

<P>CONTACT: Dawn Ringel of Cumpert Communications, 617-444-5536 or home: 617-449-4167,or Deborah Z. Altschuler, ext. 101, or Linda Menditto, ext. 108, both of NPA, 617-449-6487</P>

<P>ANN ARBOR, Mich., April 3, 1996 -- Award-winning Wild Swan Theater announces the availability of Dramatically Able, a teacher's handbook and video tape that will help teachers and youth leaders make drama accessible to children and adolescents with disabilities. Based on three years of in-class work at fifteen Michigan schools serving disabled populations (1992-1995), Wild Swan has developed a wide range of creative and fun activities that may be led by special education and classroom teachers, therapists, drama teachers, youth leaders, and parents. This pioneering work will make drama available to many participants for the first time.</P>

<P>The drama games are designed to develop creativity and imagination while fostering communication skills and building self-esteem. They can be played in any kind of space and make use of simple but imaginative props that help to engage the participants. They are ideal for the classroom as well as for drama and youth groups. The instructional materials provide teachers with dozens of activities as well as guidance about adaptations for particular disabilities including deafness, blindness, mobility impairments, and developmental disabilities. They also suggest ways that teachers can build on the activities to serve the particular goals of their group. The materials are suitable for a range of ages from pre-school through high school with age appropriateness suggested for each activity.</P>

<P>Teachers and parents are equally enthusiastic about the positive results that Wild Swan's drama activities have provided for youngsters with disabilities. As Kathy Roglitz, social worker at the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center, said of Wild Swan's work with a group of blind adolescents, "For me as a social worker, to watch the progress was most inspirational. For one parent, it was socialization of her child beyond her dreams."</P>

<P>Wild Swan Theater is one of the leading theaters for family audiences in the country and has fifteen years of experience making drama and theater accessible. Its innovative outreach programs for disabled youngsters are national models and have brought the company numerous awards, including eight years of support from very Special Arts/Michigan and grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, the Michigan Council)for the Arts, Newman's Own, Inc., the Pistons-Palace Foundation, and the Upton Foundation.</P>

<P>     The materials cost $52.50 and are designed to complement each other.
The video tape shows groups of deaf, blind, developmentally disabled, and severely multiply-disabled participants engaged	in drama game examples from the handbook. These examples give viewers opportunities to see the activities in action as well as to how they might adapt them for their own students. The handbook contains	many additional activities. </P>

<P> 	For Information about Dramatically Able, please	call Wild Swan Theater (v/tty), 313-995-0530. The video tape and accompanying handbook may be ordered by calling 800-621-5557.

<P>/ADVANCE/ NEW YORK, April 9, 1996 -- A woman's need for meeting the current recommended levels of calcium just took on new urgency. In today's Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), scientists from McMaster University (Ontario, Canada) report that consuming sufficient calcium during pregnancy can reduce the risk of pregnancy-
induced hypertension (PIH) and pre-eclampsia, a potentially fatal disorder of high blood pressure and kidney failure. Pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia affect up to one in seven American women and are leading causes of c-sections, pro-term births and low birth-weight babies, making them among the most important issues in pregnancy care.</P>

<P>The most extensive summary of randomized controlled trials in this area to date, McMaster researchers reviewed the data from 14 trials involving nearly 2,500 pregnant women. The compelling results indicate that 1,500 to 2,000 mg daily of calcium supplementation can lower the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension by 70% and the risk of pre-eclampsia by over 60%!</P>

<P>The analysis could identify no significant side-effects of increased calcium supplementation. The authors also noted that meeting calcium needs during pregnancy should reduce the incidence of related pre-term deliveries, low birth-weight babies and cesarean sections.</P>

   <H3>  Experts Urge Pregnant Women: Get Your Calcium! </H3>

<P>     This point was supported in an accompanying editorial written by David
A.McCarron, M.D., Co-Director of the Calcium Information Center, Co-Head
of the Division of Nephrology, Hypertension and Clinical Pharmacology at
the University of Dragon Health Sciences University and an accomplished hypertension researcher in his own right. 'There is a calcium crisis in this country," said Dr. McCarron. 'The most recent government survey shows that women of child-bearing age are consuming less than 600 mg of calcium a day, with many getting less than 400! The pre-natal vitamins most doctors prescribe just don't make up the difference -- they contain 200, maybe 300 mg of calcium. The bottom line is that pregnant and lactating women should increase their calcium intake to recommended levels through dietary means whenever possible, by including low-fat dairy products (such as milk, cheese, yogurt), certain dark green vegetables (such as broccoli and kale), and making up the difference by adding a reliable calcium supplement (like TUMS(R)). This simple, yet significant intervention could save thousands of lives and billions of dollars every year if employed by all women of child-bearing ago."</P>

<P>Dr. John Repke, Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Director of the Center for Labor and Birth at Harvard Medical School's Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston concurred. "Demands of the growing fetus make pregnancy a time of high calcium demand. The mother's calcium intake must increase to protect against any short or long term complications. The McMaster study enhances our understanding of the life-long biological need for calcium and reemphasizes that every pregnant woman should meet the current NIH recommendations of 1,200 to 1,500 mg of calcium per day. I prescribe 2,000 mg of calcium supplementation daily for nearly all my pregnant patients." Dr. Repke also noted that the McMaster findings rest on an extensive body of earlier clinical and basic
research which he and colleagues at Harvard and Johns Hopkins, among others, carried out over the past ten years.</P>

     <H3>Soon To Come: Results of the Largest NIH Trial </H3>

<P>The consensus in the field seems to be that although the research of the last decade -- including today's report in JAMA -- all points in the same direction, professional medical organizations might not issue official guidelines in this area until after the National Institutes of Health's division of Child and Human Development release the results of the Calcium for Pre-Eclampsia Prevention (CPEP) trial later this summer.</P>

<P>CPEP was the largest trial ever conducted in this area, and was carried out over a three year period at five U.S. academic health centers. It included over 4,000 women experiencing their first pregnancies, and used Tums brand calcium to study the effects of taking up to 2,000 mg of calcium supplementation during pregnancy. The NIH chose Tums for the GPEP trials because Tums is an affordable, high quality, calcium product which also provides safe relief of heartburn -- something most pregnant women need. One of the GPEP investigators, Dr. Baha M. Sibai, Professor and Chief of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Tennessee, believes the learnings reported in the McMaster paper are a precursor to the most important medical breakthrough for pregnancy care and Infant health in decades. "The medical community will be paying close attention to the results of GPEP," he said, wand I expect we will see significant changes in healthcare practices."</P>

<P>Follow-up analysis of the GPEP data hold the additional promise of potential beneficial life-long calcium effects on blood pressure and bone density for both mother and child.</P>

     <H3>BACKGROUND and STATISTICS</H3>
     
<P>     Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH) and Pre-eclampsia </P>
     
<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>There are 4 million pregnancies per year in the U.S. 
     	<LI>PIH, or high blood pressure, occurs in approximately 15% of all pregnancies.
     	<LI>Pre-eclampsia occurs in approximately 5% of all pregnancies. 
     	<LI>Pre-eclampsia increases the risk of pre-term births, low birth weight babies and c-section.
     	<LI>PIH can develop into pre-eclampsia any time, but usually occurs after 20 weeks of gestation.
     	<LI>PIH occurs more frequently in first time pregnancies, in women over 35, and with twins.
     	<LI>Women with pre-existing hypertensive disorders or family histories of hypertension are considered at increased risk for PIH and pre-eclampsia.
	 
</UL>

<P>    Society's cost</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>The total cost of care for premature infants in this country is $20-$40 billion annually.
     	<LI>Hospital care for a premature baby averages over $2,000 per day, adding up to as much as $125,000 or more per infants as many premature infants must remain hospitalized for weeks or months.

 	<LI>Hospital care of a very low birth weight baby can be $7,000 per day, totaling as much as half million dollars per infant! 
	<LI>Higher birth weight is associated with longer life expectancy and lower life-long risk of hypertension, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), heart disease, diabetes and osteoporosis. 

	<LI>"Higher mortality among U.S. infants is in fact due entirely to a small excess of pre-term deliveries... The prevention of excess mortality among U.S. infants depends on the prevention of pre-
	 term births...- Wilcox, at al; JAMA, March 1, 1995; Vol. 273, No. 9.
	 
</UL>

<P>     The Safety Of Calcium Supplementation</P>
     <UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Calcium supplementation of 1,500 to 2,000 mg daily can lower the risk of PIH by 7O% and the risk of pre-eclampsia by over 60% -
Guyati, at al; JAMA, April 10, 1996; Vol. 275, No. 14. 

<LI>Adequate calcium during pregnancy is also necessary for protection of the mothers bones and teeth and for development of healthy fetal bones and teeth.

     	<LI>Studies show no significant negative side-effects of increasing calcium intake during pregnancy, including kidney stones. Daily calcium intakes of up to 2,500 mg have been recognized as safe and do not increase the risk of any adverse health conditions.

     	<LI>Most pre-natal vitamins contain only 200-300 mg of calcium. 
     	<LI>Chewable calcium is an excellent form of calcium for pregnant women: It Is inexpensive (Tums, for instance, costs less than $60 a year) and offers the added benefit of safe relief of heartburn, which women need during pregnancy.

     	<LI>Because of it's high quality and superior safety, Tums was chosen by the NIH's division of Child and Human Development as the calcium supplement for the Calcium for Pre-Eclampsia Prevention (CPEP) trial.

<h3> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<P>     David Sanders, who is getting his childhood vaccinations on

time, explores Mom Martha Lee Sanders' teeth.</P>

<P>     When Martha Lee Sanders of Marietta, Ga. took her 2-month-old

son, David, to get his first round of vaccinations last October,

she got a pleasant surprise. "He got just one shot," Sanders

recalls. "That was nice, and he didn't seem to have a reaction to

it. He didn't seem to know the difference."</P>



<P>     If David had been vaccinated just a few weeks earlier, he

would have gotten an extra needle. The vaccine he received, just

approved by the Food and Drug Administration, was a combination of

the Hib vaccine, which protects against Haemophilus influenza b

infections, and DTP, which protects against diphtheria, tetanus and

pertussis (commonly known as whooping cough).</P>



<P>     Such combination vaccines make immunization faster, easier

and, for the child, a little more bearable. "Without combination

vaccines, children might feel like pincushions," says Donald S.

Gromisch, M.D., a spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics

(AAP) and member of its Committee on Infectious Diseases.</P>





<P>     "The more we combine vaccines, the better off we'll be."</P>



     In fact, Gromisch is hopeful there will be more combination

vaccines in the future.



<P>    "We're finding that the old fears about vaccines interfering

with each other aren't necessarily true," he says. The hope that

one day children will have one or two shots to guard against a slew

of diseases is "not so impossible," Gromisch adds.</P>



<P>     Clinical trials of the new combination vaccine, which has the

brand name <I>Tetramune</I>, showed no significant difference in the

effectiveness or side effects compared to the older, separate

vaccines. The most common reactions are fever, soreness at the site

of the shot, and irritability.</P>

<hr>

<h3> <a name="Protection Far Outweighs Problems">Protection Far Outweighs
Problems</a></h3>



<P>     Compared to the diseases these vaccines inoculate against,

however, the reactions to the shots are mild.</P>



<P>     Before vaccines became widely available, diseases like

measles, mumps and whooping cough were common in childhood, and

thousands died or were left blind, deaf or brain-damaged by them.

Today, vaccines have totally or nearly eradicated several diseases

such as smallpox, polio, diphtheria, and Hib infections, according

to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</P>



<P>     Yet other diseases persist, mostly in unvaccinated babies and

toddlers--the children who are most vulnerable to the effects of

disease. An estimated 37 to 56 percent of American children are not

fully immunized by age 2, according to CDC. In some inner city

areas, only 10 percent of children have been properly immunized.</P>



<P>     Some people blame the low rates on inconvenience. There are

nine diseases to vaccinate against, with as many as 15 doses in

about five visits to the doctor before a child's second birthday.</P>



<P>     Others point out that parents are required to have children

vaccinated only before enrolling them in school or day care.

Ninety-six percent of children have their shots before entering

school, according to CDC. But babies and toddlers not in structured

day care are most likely to miss their shots.</P>



<P>     The cost of vaccines may be another factor in low immunization

rates. According to CDC, vaccines for one child in 1993 cost about

$89 in the public sector and $213 in the private sector, in

addition to administrative fees usually charged. Only half of

health insurance plans cover childhood vaccines, though many public

health departments offer them free or at a reduced fee based on

income. Last fall, Congress allocated $500 million for fiscal year

1994 to provide free vaccinations to all uninsured children and to

educate parents about the need for childhood immunizations.</P>



<P>     Education is necessary, physicians say, because many parents

do not understand how dangerous childhood illnesses are.</P>



<P>     "They're not real in people's minds," says Gromisch. "Years

before the whooping cough vaccine, many children died of whooping

cough. In inner cities a few years ago where vaccination rates are

dismal, people continued to die [of whooping cough]."</P>



<P>     In fact, diseases that are uncommon in most parts of the

United States today are nearly epidemic in American communities

where children are not properly vaccinated.</P>



<P>     Measles, for instance, had dropped to a record low of fewer

than 1,500 cases in 1983, according to CDC. A resurgence of measles

between 1989 and 1991, however, resulted in 55,000 cases and 132

deaths, mostly among unvaccinated babies and toddlers. In urban

areas, minority children are four to nine times as likely to get

measles as white children.</P>



<P>     The resurgence of childhood illnesses costs money as well as

lives. According to the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of

Medicine, every $1 in vaccinations saves $10 in later health-care

costs.</P>

<P>     Whether a child receives vaccinations at a pediatrician's

office or health department, the health-care provider is expected

to keep careful records of when each shot was given and what brand

it was. Some brands have slightly different schedules than others.

Parents should ask for copies of the shot record to keep at home as

a reminder for the next round.</P>



<P>     Even if a child misses an appointment, it's possible to catch

up. Says Gromisch of the AAP, "Usually it's not too late. In

general, if you miss a vaccine, you can get it the next time

around."</P>



<P>     Immunization schedules have changed in recent years. Several

new, vaccines have been added, and old ones have been reformulated

to be safer than ever. Here is a list of vaccinations recommended

for children.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3> <a name="Hib">Hib</a></h3>


<P>     Before the vaccine to protect against Haemophilus influenza

type b, this bacterial infection struck 1 child in 200 before the

fifth birthday. Of those, 12,000 children a year developed

meningitis, which killed 1 in 20 and caused brain damage for 1 in

4. Hib can also infect blood, joints, bones, soft tissues, the

throat, and the membrane surrounding the heart.</P>



<P>     Hib vaccines are the latest development among childhood

immunizations, and their benefits have been far-reaching. The first

Hib vaccine was available in 1987 for children 15 to 18 months old.

But in 1990, FDA licensed the first vaccine effective in babies

under a year old, the age group in which Hib infections are most

damaging.</P>



<P>     Hib vaccines are "conjugate" vaccines, made up of small pieces

of bacterial polysaccharides, or sugars, linked to proteins. They

have nearly eradicated Hib infections among vaccinated children in

the United States, according to CDC.</P>



<P>     FDA has licensed four Hib vaccines, in addition to the

combination Tetramune vaccine mentioned earlier. The most recently

approved vaccine is distributed in the United States under two

brand names, OmniHib and ActHIB.</P>



<P>     Depending on the brand of vaccine, Hib is given in either

three or four doses by the time the child is 12 to 18 months old.

Side effects are very minor, consisting mostly of low-grade fever

and soreness at the site of the shot.</P>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3> <a name="DTP">DTP</a></h3>



<P>     The DTP shot is a combination inoculation against diphtheria,

tetanus and pertussis. It is given at 2, 4, 6, and 15 to 18 months

of age, with a booster between 4 and 6 years.</P>



<P>     Diphtheria is an infection of the throat, mouth and nose. It's

extremely rare today, but highly contagious. The infection causes

a sore throat and cough. Sometimes a fine web of gray membrane

forms over the tonsils, blocking the windpipe and suffocating the

child. If not promptly treated, diphtheria can also lead to

pneumonia, heart failure, and paralysis.</P>



<P>     Pertussis, or whooping cough, is lifethreatening, especially

in children under 1 year. It's caused by a bacterium that clogs the

airways with mucus, causing a severe cough that sounds like a

"whoop." The coughing can last two months, inviting other

infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis.</P>



<P>     The pertussis component of DTP causes more adverse reactions

than any other vaccine. Most common are fever, soreness at the site

of the shot, and irritability. In rare cases, the vaccine causes

very high fever and convulsions.</P>



<P>     FDA licensed in 1992 a version of the pertussis vaccine with

potential for fewer local and febrile reactions. Unlike the old

version, which is made from whole cells of pertussis bacteria that

have been killed, the new vaccine is "acellular," made from

portions of the cells. It has fewer side effects and has been

approved for the fourth dose, given between 15 and 18 months, and

the last dose, given before school entry. Scientists have not

determined yet whether the acellular vaccine is safe and effective

for infants.</P>

<P>Chart: <a href="kids-vac.image.html" alt=vaccination chart>Vaccination Schedule for Children</a>
<br>
(KidSource OnLine Editor's note:  this is the same chart as ontop of the page)</P>

<ol>

<li>This schedule is for high-risk infants (those whose mothers

have tested positive for hepatitis B). These infants should receive

hepatitis B immune globulin at or shortly after the first vaccine

dose. Infants not at high risk also should be vaccinated against

hepatitis B. Check with your doctor for the appropriate schedule.



<li>May not be required, depending on type of vaccine used. Check

with your doctor.



<li>Given at 12, 15, or 18 months, depending on type of vaccine.

Check with your doctor.



<li>Where required by public health authorities for school entry.

Otherwise: 11-12 years. Check with your doctor.

<P>     Tetanus is a rare infection caused by bacteria found in dirt,

gravel and rusty metal. It enters the body through a cut, creating

a toxin, or poison, that causes the muscles to spasm. The toxin

attacks jaw muscles first, often resulting in lockjaw. Tetanus can

also cause the breathing muscles to spasm, resulting in death for

3 out of 10 people who get it.</P>



<P>     The primary series of tetanus shots is given as part of the

DTP shot during infancy. After that, the tetanus vaccine should be

given as a booster every 10 years throughout life.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3> <a name="Hepatitis B">Hepatitis B</a></h3>



<P>     Hepatitis B is a viral disease transmitted through blood and

body fluids. In its acute phase it can cause liver failure and

death. It can also become chronic, causing liver damage over a

number of years.</P>



<P>     Except for infants born to mothers with this infection,

children are not at great risk of developing hepatitis B, but

health-care workers, homosexuals, intravenous drug users, and some

ethnic groups and nationalities are. Attempts to vaccinate adults

have been largely unsuccessful, however. It's easier to reach

children because school enrollment requires immunization.</P>



<P>     Therefore, for lifelong protection, CDC has recommended that

all infants be vaccinated before 15 months of age in three

doses. There are no serious reactions to the vaccine.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3> <a name="Polio">Polio</a></h3>



<P>     Polio is remembered by many older Americans as a frightening

disease that was epidemic during the 1950s. In 1952, more than

20,000 people--mostly children/were afflicted, according to CDC.

Polio's first symptoms are fever, sore throat, headache, and stiff

neck. The potentially fatal disease can soon progress to paralysis

of the lower limbs and chest, making walking and breathing

difficult or impossible. There is no cure for the disease.</P>



<P>     There are two polio vaccines. One is an inactivated polio

vaccine (IPV) in which the polio virus has been killed. Licensed in

1955, this vaccine is injected into the patient. The second vaccine

is made from live polio viruses. This oral polio vaccine (OPV) was

licensed in 1963 and is taken as drops in the mouth.</P>



<P>     Since the development of the oral vaccine, the incidence of

polio has dropped to fewer than 10 cases per year. In fact, the

oral vaccine has entirely prevented polio caused by the wild virus

(not vaccine related) in North and South America since 1991,

according to the Pan-American Health Organization.</P>



<P>     However, in the last two decades the oral vaccine itself has

caused paralytic polio in a very few children who received the

vaccine, and in a few adults who came in close contact with

recently vaccinated children. The risk of contracting polio this

way is no more than 1 in 1.5 million. It is greatest for people who

have immune deficiencies such as AIDS, cancer, or other diseases

that make it hard for the body to fight infection. Because of this

risk, CDC recommends that IPV be given to children who have immune

deficiencies or who live with adults who do. Parents who have not

been vaccinated for polio should consider getting vaccinated with

IPV before the child receives the oral vaccine.</P>



<P>     A number of lawsuits have been filed against Lederle

Laboratories, Inc., manufacturer of the oral vaccine. While the

government was found negligent in its applications of some

regulations on vaccine approval and vaccine lot release, the court

has nevertheless affirmed the safety and importance of the vaccine.</P>



<P>     The district court judge in Maryland wrote in April 1991, "...

the scientists who established and implemented the OPV program were

(and are) extraordinarily able professionals who consistently acted

in the public interest as they reasonably perceived it to be. They

made judgments on extremely difficult questions which, strictly

from the standpoint of public health, appear to have been entirely

proper."</P>



<P>     Although the modern IPV does not appear to cause adverse

reactions, at this time public health authorities, including CDC,

recommend the oral polio vaccine because it is more effective. It

doesn't require continual booster shots, it is easier to

administer, and it also helps spread immunity to the population at

large. The oral vaccine is given at 2, 4, and 15 to 18 months, and

again between 4 and 6 years.</P>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3> <a name="MMR">MMR</a></h3>



<P>     The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella

(German measles).</P>



<P>     Measles is a highly contagious disease that causes high fever,

cough, and a spotty rash. Possible complications include ear

infections and pneumonia as well. More rarely, measles can infect

the brain, causing convulsions, hearing loss, mental retardation,

and even death. Babies under 2 and adults get much sicker with

measles than do elementary school children.</P>



<P>     The MMR vaccine is given in two doses, at 15 months and again

between 4 and 6 years or before junior high or middle school. Most

children have no side effects from the MMR vaccine, but about 5 to

15 percent develop a fever. A few develop a measles-like rash,

swelling of the lymph glands, and mild pain in the joints.</P>



<P>     Mumps is known for causing painful, swollen salivary glands

under the jaw, as well as fever and headache. Mumps can be a very

serious disease, causing meningitis or hearing loss. Teenage and

adult males who get mumps may have painful swelling of the

testicles for several days, although no infertility problems later.

They get much sicker and suffer longer than children do with the

disease.</P>



<P>     Rubella is also called German measles. It's a mild disease in

children, but rubella endangers the fetus when a pregnant woman

catches it. As many as half of the women who contract rubella while

pregnant, especially during the first three months, miscarry or

deliver babies with heart disease, blindness, hearing loss, or

learning problems. Before the rubella vaccine was approved in 1969,

some 20,000 babies were born with severe birth defects because

their mothers were exposed to the disease while pregnant.</P>



<P>     Women with no proof of rubella immunity can be tested for it

and should receive the vaccine before getting pregnant. Pregnant

women not should receive the rubella vaccine, nor should a woman

get pregnant within three months after getting the vaccine because

it will endanger the fetus.</P>



<P>     Despite occasional serious reactions from vaccines, for the

vast majority of children, benefits of immunity greatly outweigh

the risks.</P>



<P>     Before any vaccine is licensed by FDA, it has been tested and

evaluated thoroughly both in the laboratory and in clinical trials.

Besides reviewing scientific studies on vaccines before licensing

them, the agency is involved in basic research leading to the

development of new and safer products. The acellular pertussis

vaccine, for example, was developed in part based on research by

FDA scientists.</P>



<P>     Agency scientists have developed methods to test vaccines in

the laboratory before using them on children. They have also

developed accurate methods for testing those children to see if

they have appropriate immune responses to new vaccines.</P>



<P>     FDA continues to encourage the timely inoculation of all

children in this country against childhood diseases, and to make

sure those vaccines are as safe and effective as possible.* </P>

<h3> <a name="Vaccines and the Law">Vaccines and the Law</a></h3>

<P>     In 1986, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury

Act to help ensure vaccine safety and availability, and to

compensate people injured by vaccination.</P>



<P>     The act established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation

Program to compensate those who suffer certain vaccine-related

injuries or death. The act also required health-care providers and

manufacturers of specified vaccines to report certain serious

adverse reactions they encounter. FDA and the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention keep track of these reports through the

Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS.</P>



<P>     VAERS tracks serious vaccine reactions, not common fevers and

soreness from shots. Serious reactions include death,

life-threatening illness, hospitalization, and disability resulting

from a vaccine. Patient identity is kept confidential.</P>



<P>     Monthly reports from VAERS are sent to FDA's Center for

Biologics Evaluation and Research, which evaluates possible safety

issues. Anyone may file a report. To receive a VAERS reporting

form, call (1-800) 822-7967.</P>



<P>     From its beginning to September 1993, VAERS received more than

20,000 reports. Though it helps in assessing the number of adverse

reactions to vaccines nationwide, VAERS is a "passive" system that

relies on reporting from health-care professionals and others. For

instance, VAERS does not directly compare the incidence of disease

among recently vaccinated people with disease among people who have

not been vaccinated.</P>



<P>     The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program protects

doctors and manufacturers from lawsuits while providing

compensation for those injured from vaccines. It's designed to be

easier and faster than traditional legal remedies for medical

injuries.</P>



<P>     Individuals claiming more than $1,000 in expenses from vaccine

injury may be eligible for as much as $250,000 compensation. Any

death from a vaccine is awarded the highest amount in compensation.</P>



<P>     Some injuries may be compensated without proof that the

vaccine was at fault. These are spelled out in a vaccine injury

table. Most injuries must occur within hours or days of a vaccine

to be considered a result of the shot. For more information about

what injuries may be compensated, call (1-800) 338-2382.</P>

<B>Children and Bilingualism</B>

<P>   According to the 1990 United States Census, one in seven or 31.8
million people speak a language other than English in their home. In the
past, second generation children were encouraged to adopt the customs,
culture, and language of what was identified as the majority culture.
Today, with greater recognition and celebration of cultural differences,
people are more likely to maintain and share their primary language with
their children and to promote bilingualism as a reflection of ethnic pride
and identity.</P>

<B>What is Bilingualism?</B>

<P>   Different people use the term in different ways. For some,
bilingualism means an equal ability to communicate in two languages. For
others, bilingualism means the ability to communicate in two languages but
with the possibility of greater skills in one language.</P>

<B>How Do I Teach My Child to be Bilingual?</B>

<P>   There are different theories on the "best" way to teach a child to
use two languages. Most researchers agree that a child who is exposed to
two languages at an early age, and simultaneously, will naturally learn to
use both languages.</P>

<P>   Children can be expected to go through some periods of mixing the two
languages and borrowing vocabulary to express ideas, sometimes within the
same sentence. This occurs because vocabulary may exist in one language but
not in the other. Or words from one language may convey a message that is
not easily translated into the other language. A separation of the two
languages will occur gradually. Children may also experiment with the two
languages to create special effects or to express themselves in specific
settings. For example, one language may be identified as less formal and
used for information about events related to home and family. The other
language may be identified as more formal and used for activities outside
the home. There may also be periods when one language is used more than the
other. The opposite occurs with a change in the environment.</P>
 <P>  Children may not be equally skilled in both languages. It is common
for there to be greater understanding than actual use of one language. Less
confusion will occur if children learn to associate the two languages
differently, for example if one language is used while speaking to the
mother and the other while speaking to the father.</P>

<B>Will Using Two Languages Cause Speech Language Problems?</B>

<P>   In general, speech-language problems are less likely to occur when
both languages are introduced early and simultaneously. There is a greater
possibility of problems if children are introduced to a second language
during the preschool years after another language was used exclusively.
Some people believe that if a second language is introduced before the
first language is fully developed, the development of the first language
may be slowed or even regress. Others believe that the skill level of the
second language will develop only to that of the first.</P>
<P>   Parents who are concerned about their child's speech-language
development should contact a speech-language pathologist. An appropriate
evaluation of skills will include evaluation of both languages, and will be
completed by a bilingual speech-language pathologist or one who has
knowledge of the rules and structure of both languages and the assistance
of a translator or interpreter. The discovery that a child has some delays
in both languages does not necessarily indicate a need for professional
services. These delays may be characteristic of a two language learner.</P>

<P>     ST. LOUIS, March 28,1996 -- In a major effort to put quality science education materials directly into the hands of teachers, Microsoft Corporation (Nasdaq: MSFT) and the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) today announced the free distribution of a field-tested, comprehensive curriculum for high school science as part of the Global Schoolhouse (GSH), a popular education resource area on the Internet. The new GSH web site, launched at the NSTA Convention in St. Louis, Mo., gives science educators in-depth descriptions of the content components of the now National Science Education Standards (NSES) and science teaching materials designed to achieve those standards.</P>

<P>     At the GSH web site, teachers now have immediate access to learning resources developed by the NSTA, called "Micro-Units," for more than 80 topics in biology, chemistry, Earth and space sciences, and physics. The materials are linked to the National Science Education Standards recently developed by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. For teachers, Micro-Units include materials for helping students learn the content of the unit, along with assessment tools. Student materials provide basic activities, hands-on investigations and readings for each unit. </P>

<P>     "Developing this Internet site with the NSTA is a demonstration of our ongoing commitment to help build what we call the Connected Learning Community," said Jonathan Lazarus, vice president of education strategic relations for Microsoft. "Members of the education community can share best practices and build on each other's work. Students and teachers alike will have access to rich learning resources at their fingertips."</P>

<P>     "With the increasing importance of science and technology in our daily lives, it is more important than ever that all students have the critical-thinking and problem-solving skills a quality science education can develop," said Bill Aldridge, NSTA director of special projects. "Working with Microsoft to make this standards-based curriculum available on the Internet will have an immediate impact on the quality of science education not only in the U.S., but globally."</P>

<P>     The overall curriculum framework and the Micro-Units are the work of the Scope, Sequence and Coordination of High School Sciences (SSC) project, an NSTA initiative funded by the National Science Foundation. In addition to supporting the now science education standards, the curriculum's integrated and coordinated design reflects the best research on how students learn. High school students study all four natural sciences every year across all grade levels, instead of the traditional "layer cake" pattern of a single science subject each school year.</P>

<P>     Before being posted to the web, materials are reviewed by experienced science teachers, teaching scientists and research scientists as well as field-tested in schools. Curriculum materials for the ninth-grade level are available now; materials for 10th through 12th grades will follow. Science teachers who download and use the nearly 2,000 pages of free materials also can provide feedback to help improve the curriculum.</P>

<P>     To organize these extensive resources and provide multiple links
between curriculum areas and the science standards, Microsoft developed this site using Microsoft(R) Internet Information Server, a new, easy-
to-use web server publishing solution, and Microsoft BackOffice(TM), an integrated family of server software built on the Windows (TM) Server operating system.</P>

<P>     Visit the SSC web site at http://www.gsh.org/NSTA(underscore) SSandC/. The site is hosted on the Global Schoolhouse, developed jointly by the Global SchoolNet Foundation and Microsoft. The NSTA science curriculum is the first step in Microsoft's larger effort to work with curriculum experts and experienced educators to develop rich educational resources on the Internet including a curriculum repository for lesson plans and classroom tools; a teacher resource center for information on teaching standards, information about in service training and conferences; and a library of innovative classroom projects.</P>

<P>     Microsoft's work with the MSTA is part of the company's continuing initiative to help create a global Connected Learning Community in which all students have access to technology and the tools and skills to use information effectively today and for a lifetime. In addition, Microsoft is committed to motivating students' lifelong interest in science and technology education by supporting and developing science based software and teacher's activity guides for use at home and in the schools, such as Scholastic's The Magic School Bus(R) series for exploration of the human body, the solar system and the ocean, and Encarta(R) 96 Encyclopedia and Encarta(R) 96 World Atlas.</P>

<P>     Founded in 1944, the National Science Teachers Association, based in Arlington, Va., is the world's largest professional organization dedicated to improving science teaching at all levels -- preschool through college. NSTA's 53,000-plus members include science teachers, science supervisors, administrators, scientists, business and industry representatives and others involved in science education. NSTA holds many conventions each year. More than 15,000 people will attend its 1996 national convention in St. Louis, which provides 1,000 exhibits of resources for science learning in schools and colleges.</P>

<P>     NSTA publications include the bimonthly news magazine, NSTA Reports!, Quantum, and teacher-oriented magazines at each level: Science and Children for elementary school, Science Scope for middle school, The Science Teacher for high school, and Journal of College Science Teaching for college teachers. A new NSTA magazine, Dragonfly, aimed at young children will debut in St. Louis. For more information about NSTA call 800-722-NSTA.</P>

<P>     Founded in 1975, Microsoft is the worldwide leader in software for personal computers. The company offers a wide range of products and services for business and personal use, each designed with the mission of making it easier and more enjoyable for people to take advantage of the full power of personal computing every day.</P>

<P>PHILADELPHIA, March 29, 1996 -- The following was Issued by Carol Knightly, Pediatric Audiologist, Children's Seashore House:</P>

<P>How do you know if your child has a hearing problem? From the day of birth, an infant's hearing ability can be accurately tested. If you think your child has the slightest hearing or speech problem, take your daughter or son to an audiologist, a specialist in hearing testing and hearing loss. A loss of hearing can result in developmental delays and many missed learning experiences.</P>

<P>Hearing loss affects approximately three million American children under the age of 18. Causes of hearing problems include repeated ear infections, head injuries, medical complications before, during and after birth, and a family history of hearing loss.</P>

<P>What are some of the warning signs that a child has a hearing problem? A newborn who does not startle, move or cry at unexpected loud noises should be taken to an audiologist. Infants who do not babble, have stopped babbling, or does not turn his or her head in the direction of your voice should also be chocked. Toddlers with a hearing problem often show signs such as not responding to a first call, or not advancing their language skills. The key is to be observant of your child's behavior which could Indicate a hearing problem.</P>

<P>With the help of state-of-the-art equipment designed specifically for children, audiologists can accurately evaluate your child's hearing. Once your child's hearing Is tested, an audiologist can assess the extent of any hearing loss, Identify the cause and recommend an appropriate treatment program. They can tell you what kind of hearing aids or other assistive listening devices are available for your child, as well as counsel your family regarding the impact of hearing loss and options for language and educational programs.</P>

<P>If your child has hearing loss that goes undiagnosed, many important learning experiences will be missed. Therefore, it is important that you seek professional help from an audiologist if you're unsure of how well your child is hearing. Remember, a child is never too young to have a hearing test, and there are many treatment options available.</P>

<P>Carol Knightly is the acting director of the Audiology Department at Children's Seashore House, a pediatric rehabilitation hospital located in Philadelphia. Children's Seashore House has more than 25 years of experience with children and hearing problems. All the audiologists hold their master's degree, with special training In prevention, identification, assessment and non-medical treatment of hearing disorders. Most of them have also completed their fellowships specifically in pediatric audiology.</P>

     <p>May is National Hearing and speech Month.</p>

<P>    TAMPA, Fla., March 18, 1996. By the time they are preteens, children
tend to view smoking cigarettes as a normal adult habit even though most
adults do not smoke, a study by researchers at the University of South
Florida College of Public Health found.</P>
<P>     "We found, both among kids who smoke and those who do not, a strong
perception that smoking is a typical adult practice," said Robert
McDermott, Ph.D., chairperson of the USF Department of Community and Family
Health.  "Yet, fewer than 30 percent of people over age 18 smoke."</P>
<P>    The finding suggests that tobacco advertising and television shows
or movies in which a disproportionate share of adults smoke may
inaccurately color children's perceptions about the normalcy of smoking, he
said.</P>
<P>     Dr. McDermott and his colleagues surveyed 813 fifth-grade students
in west central Florida.  The survey examined the students' attitudes about
tobacco use as well as other high-risk behaviors.</P>
<P>     Most of those surveyed were ages 10 to 12.  Of the 813
participants, 6.5 percent, or 53, were current smokers meaning they had
smoked at least one day in the last month.  Seventeen percent (138)
reported "ever smoking" a cigarette, and more than 8 percent (67) expected
to try smoking in the next year.</P>
<P>    "By age 10 or 11 those kids who smoke are already making a
commitment toward the social acceptability of smoking," Dr. McDermott said.
"Research has demonstrated adolescent smokers are more likely than
nonsmokers to drink, experiment with drugs, engage in unsafe sex, carry
weapons and become involved in other high-risk behaviors."</P>
<P>    The findings included:</P>

<P>    --  72 percent of the fifth-graders who smoked and 74 percent of the
nonsmokers agreed most adults smoke.<BR>
    --  The children who smoked were more likely than the nonsmokers to
perceive that most peers have at least tried cigarettes.<BR>
    --  Smokers were 11 times more likely than nonsmokers to agree with the
statement "A few years from now, when I am in high school, smoking
cigarettes will be O.K."<BR>
    --  85 percent of nonsmoking fifth-graders agreed there is relationship
between smoking and other substance use and school performance.  Only 56
percent of their nonsmoking peers perceived a link.</P>
<P>    The study was funded through the Florida Health Information Center
at the USF College of Public Health.</P>

<P>    WASHINGTON, March 20 -- If parents of the nearly four million kids
who suffer from seasonal allergies adhere to some basic guidelines, they
may be able to significantly minimize their child's symptoms throughout the
season.  The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ( AAFA) recommends
that parents follow a few basic steps to help them enjoy the warm
weather.</P>

<P>    <I>Tips for Parents</I></P>

<P>     -- Limit outdoor school and extracurricular activities (e.g.,
recess, little league) in the morning when pollen counts are the
highest<BR>
     -- Do a thorough spring cleaning -- windows, book shelves and air
conditioning vents collected dust and mold throughout the winter that can
provoke allergy symptoms<BR>
     -- Avoid playing outdoors on recently mowed lawns (e.g., baseball
fields)<BR>
     -- Beware of high mold spore counts after a heavy rain or in the
evening<BR>
     -- Keep windows closed, and if possible, use air conditioning during
the warm weather to keep airborne allergens out of your home<BR>
     -- Talk to your physician about treatment medications that are safe
for children and won't make them drowsy</P>

<P>     "This year's wet and snowy winter promises to yield an abundance of
outdoor allergens and the onset of spring could be a particularly
frustrating time for parents and children who suffer from seasonal
allergies," said Dawn Marvin, Director of Communications from AAFA.
"Identifying triggers will enable parents to make smart choices about
family and school activities during the spring and summer."</P>
<P>     There are many airborne allergens that can prompt a child's
allergic symptoms, including pollen, dust mites, mold spores, and animal
dander (hair or skin particles).  Common symptoms children experience may
include repeated sneezing, itchy nose and eyes, congestion and frequent
throat clearing.</P>
<P>     AAFA encourages parents to talk to teachers and school nurses about
arranging their child's schedule so that exposure to allergens at school is
limited.  In addition, parents should ask their physicians about safe and
effective medications available for children prior to the onset of allergy
season.</P>

<P>     <I>Choose Children's Treatments Carefully</I></P>
<P>    Although avoidance of airborne allergens can help in allergy
management, this is often impossible, and medication may help in reducing
symptoms.  For children, there are only a few options.  Nasal
corticosteroids, which are available by prescription in the form of nasal
spray, have been proven to be safe and effective for treating children as
young as six years.  Nasal corticosteroids reduce inflammation in the nasal
passages that greatly contributes to nasal congestion, runny nose,
sneezing, and nasal itching.  These medications do not cause a "rebound
effect" (symptoms becoming worse when non-prescription nasal
corticosteroids are overused) and are also effective in preventing nasal
symptoms.</P>
<P>    Antihistamines are also effective for managing seasonal allergies.
These medications work by blocking the release of histamine -- one of
the substances released during an allergic reaction.  Antihistamines are
available for children without a prescription, but may have sedating side
effects.  Nonsedating antihistamines, which are available by prescription
for children age 12 and older, provide relief from seasonal nasal allergy
symptoms without causing the drowsiness experienced by some people when
taking over-the-counter antihistamines.</P>
<P>    The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America is offering a free
brochure with helpful advice for parents on how to manage their children's
allergies.  To receive a free copy or for more information, call
1-800-7-ASTHMA (1-800-727-8462).</P>
<P>    The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America is a private
not-for-profit organization dedicated to helping people with asthma and
allergic diseases through education, support for research, and an array of
services offered by a national network of chapters and affiliated support
groups.</P>

<P>BALTIMORE, March 25,1996 -- Classen Immunotherapies has published data in the April issue of Diabetologia (Journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes) indicating that immunization alters the risk of developing
insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM). The data demonstrates that administration at birth of a single dose of BCG vaccine, used in
Europe to prevent tuberculosis, is associated with the prevention of up to 50 cases of diabetes/100,000 children immunized, the
equivalent of over a 25% decrease in diabetes by age 15 in many industrialized nations. Classen Immunotherapies' data was derived
by reanalyzing a Swedish epidemiology study following over 400,000 immunized and unimmunized children for 12 years.</P>

<P>The data supports Classen Immunotherapies' earlier studies (patent application PCT/US 94/08825) showing that immunization at birth
may reduce diabetes while immunization starting after 8 weeks may increase the risk of diabetes, presumably due to the timing of
interferon release. The added effect of administering a dose of a vaccine starting at birth, as opposed to starting after 2 months, may
result in a 50% reduction in diabetes by age 19. The discovery indicates that vaccine safety studies are dangerously flawed because
they are not designed to detect the effect of vaccines on common autoimmune diseases such as insulin dependent diabetes. The data
indicates that vaccines may be having an even greater impact on autoimmune diseases than on the serious infectious complications
which they are designed to prevent. Classen Immunotherapies is the first to develop proprietary pediatric immunization methods to
prevent diabetes.</P>

<P>Classen Immunotherapies' discovery raises strong doubts about the safety of vaccines and indicate that clinical trials are needed
immediately to either confirm or disprove the effect of vaccines on diabetes. If confirmed, Classen Immunotherapies discoveries will
revolutionize the vaccine field and lead to safer immunization practices. The benefit from changing immunization schedules may
exceed the benefit from immunization against polio, due to the high incidence and cost of insulin dependent diabetes. A US citizen's
life time risk of developing IDDM may reach 1:100 while the total US cost of this disease may exceed $30 billion annually. Safer
vaccines could be on the market in a few years if government officials make vaccine safety a priority.</P>

<P>NEW ORLEANS, March 19, 1996 -- A new investigational once-daily water-based nasal spray, Nasacort AQ (triamcinolone acetonide), can safely and effectively treat hay fever symptoms in patients as young as six years of age, according to the results of a new study presented today at the 52nd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.</P>

<P>     Hay fever -- also called seasonal allergic rhinitis -- is a common health problem, affecting approximately 22 million Americans of all ages.</P>

<P>     The new data showed that Nasacort AQ, a nasally inhaled corticosteroid, relieves hay fever symptoms caused by an allergy to grass pollen in children ranging from six to eleven years of age.</P>

<P>     "Since 16 percent of all six to 12-year-olds have hay fever, it is important to develop simple, safe, and effective treatments for this population," said Guy Settipane, M.D., clinical professor of medicine at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and one of the trial's lead investigators. "Our findings strongly suggest that Nasacort AQ can help satisfy this objective."</P>

<P>     The Phase III trial included 223 children ranging from six to
12 years of age who had a history of hay fever induced by an allergy to spring grass and whose symptoms had not been adequately controlled by antihistamines, decongestants, and/or immunotherapy.</P>

<P>     Patients were randomized to treatment with once-daily Nasacort AQ (110 micrograms or 220 micrograms -- the equivalent of one or two sprays per nostril) or a placebo nasal spray.</P>


<P>     Both doses of Nasacort AQ provided significantly better relief of nasal allergy symptoms -- runny nose, stuffiness, sneezing, and itching than did placebo over the course of the two-week trial, Dr. Settipane reported. The improvement in symptoms occurred as early as the first day of treatment.</P>

<P>     Overall, both patients and physicians reported that they preferred Nasacort AQ to the placebo preparation.</P>

<P>     Adverse events were equally uncommon in all three treatment groups, and no patient had to withdraw from the study prematurely because of a treatment-related side effect. The most frequent complaint was nasal irritation.</P>

<P>     While prior clinical trials have documented the effectiveness of Nasacort AQ in patients between 12 and 80 years of age, our study demonstrates its potential role in young children," said Dr. Settipane. "The fact that this medication can be taken once daily is also an important consideration given that the multiple daily dosing required with most other hay fever medications has been associated with reduced patient compliance and an inadequate therapeutic response."</P>

<P>     Hay fever is caused by an allergic sensitivity to pollens from trees, grasses, or weeds, or to airborne mold spores and typically occurs during spring, summer and fall. When affected persons breathe in pollens or molds, their immune system releases the chemical histamine, which then produces inflammation and swelling of the fragile lining of the nose, sinuses, eyelids, and surface layer of the eyes.</P>

<P>     Resulting symptoms commonly include nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, runny eyes, and an itching sensation in the nose and throat and on the upper part of the mouth.</P>

<P>  Nasacort AQ is being developed by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. (NYSE: RPR), a global pharmaceutical company dedicated to improving human health.</P>

<P>Thank you for requesting information from the National Information Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities (NICHCY). As you may know, NICHCY maintains a resource collection and database that is utilized to develop publications, fact sheets, and to answer specific inquiries. Unfortunately, our Information Specialists are not able to do in-depth literature reviews,  research bibliographies, and thesis/dissertation abstracts for students, journalists, or professional researchers. This effort, while worthwhile, is far beyond the financial and labor capacities of this project. We are able to provide you with some general information and tips to assist you in the development of your research. The enclosed information should assist you in locating the references you need.</P>



<P>We would suggest that you begin at a university, public, or private library that can give you access to computer databases. Ask the Reference Librarian to help you conduct a bibliographic search on your topic. In many instances, there are computerized databases available for searching. The library may then have some of the materials you identify.</P>

<P>There are two excellent databases in existence which are useful when seeking information resources (articles, conference proceedings, research reports, etc.) in Special Education:<B> ERIC</B> and <B>ECER</B>.These two are described in more detail below, and information is given about how you may access these valuable resources in your literature search.</P>

<P>We hope that this information is useful in assisting you with your search, and we wish you success in your studies and research.</p>

<a name="ERIC"></a>
<H3>What is ERIC?</H3>

<P>ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) is a federally funded information system with a database of over 40,000 journal annotations and 700,000 education  related document abstracts. It is a source of publications about all aspects of education.</P>

<H3>How Can You Access ERIC?</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	


<LI><B>Through the Clearinghouses</B>: One way to use the ERIC system is to contact the ERIC Clearinghouse that covers your topic. (See the list of clearinghouses that follows). The Clearinghouse response may be: pamphlets or flyers, bibliographies of selected publications, suggestions for searching, or referral to other sources of information. <br><br>

<LI><B>Through a Local Library</B>: A university, professional, or public library near your home probably has access to the ERIC database. The librarian can help you find the information you need by using the ERIC reference publications or by doing a computerized search of the database. Many university libraries also have the ERIC database on CD-ROM which often enables users to access and search ERIC without charge. <br><br>

<LI><B>Through a Home, Office, or School Computer</B>: Using a computer equipped with a modem, you can search ERIC via Internet or for a fee by signing up  with any of these services:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>BRS (1-800-955-0906); 
	<LI>CompuServe (1-800-848-8199); 
	<LI>Dialog (1-800-334-2564); 
	<LI>GTE (1-800-927-3000), and 
	<LI>OCLC (I-800-848-5878)<BR><BR>

<hr>

<a name="ECER"></a>
<H3>What is ECER?</H3>

<P>ECER (Exceptional Child Education Resources) is a database privately developed by the Council for Exceptional Children.
The database contains citations and abstracts of print and nonprint materials dealing with the education and development of people of all ages who have disabilities or who are gifted. Resources
in all areas of special education and related services are also covered in ECER.</P>

<P>Some overlap exists between the ECER and ERIC databases. This overlap applies primarily to unpublished documents (curriculum and teaching guides, reports etc.) and to articles in core special education journals. The ECER records that do not appear in ERIC include published books, additional journal articles, and nonprint materials. Therefore, to conduct a comprehensive search of resources in special education, it is a good idea to search both ERIC and ECER.</P>

<H3>How Can You Access ECER?</H3>

<P>To access ECER at the present time, you will need to contact the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) and ask that a search of the database be conducted to meet your specific needs. CEC is currently in the process of making the database available on CD-ROM, a process that should be completed sometime in 1994. For information on the availability and accessibility of the database, or to request an information search, call 1-800-328-0272.</P>

<P>CHICAGO, March 11, 1996. The number of school-aged children without cavities in their permanent teeth has doubled in the past two  decades, according to a study published in the March Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA).</P>

<P>                         The researchers concluded that cavities are still a problem that affect millions of U.S. children and adolescents, and that if these children receive regular dental care, including dental sealants on appropriate teeth, additional declines in the cavity rate will likely result.</P>

<P>                         Researchers at the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) published findings from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) that estimates dental cavity rates for more than 54 million U.S. children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years. The data represent the total civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.</P>

<P>                         Researchers from NIDR used baseline data from a study conducted from 1971-74 in which researchers found that 26 percent of children ages 6 to 17 were cavity free in their permanent teeth. In the NHANES III study, scientists found that 55 percent of children ages 5 to 17 had no cavities in their permanent teeth, more than double the rate found in the prior study.</P>

<P>                         The researchers also discovered that more than 60 percent of the children under age 10 had no cavities in their primary teeth.</P>

<P>                         One influential trend in the cavity rate decline emerged from the NHANES III research. NIOR researchers found that dental sealant use doubled since the last national survey was conducted, from 7.6 percent of children age 5 to 17 in 1986-87 to 19 percent of children this age in 1988-91. Still, only one in five school-aged children had sealants on any of their permanent teeth.</P>

<P>                         "These findings indicate a continuing decline in dental caries in the permanent teeth of U.S. children," said the study's lead author, Dr. L. Jackson Brown, director, division of epidemiology and oral disease prevention at NIDR. "However, a similar decline could not be detected in the primary, or baby teeth, of children."</P>
                        
<P>                        Dr. Brown cited fluoridated water and fluoridated oral health products, a higher rate of dental visits and an improved diet as some
 of the main reasons why the dental cavity rate has declined in the past 20 years.</P>

<P>LOS ANGELES, Feb. 28,1996/ -- When it comes to
allergy sufferers, all people are not the same.  Children, the elderly, athletes
and pregnant women have been identified as groups requiring different management
and care, according to newly released treatment guidelines for allergic
rhinitis, developed at a consensus conference convened by the Office of
Continuing Medical Education, UCLA School of Medicine.</P>

<P> The guidelines, which provide physicians with recommended therapies for treating these groups, indicate that genetic and environmental factors may provoke or worse the symptoms of allergic rhinitis in each group.  For instance, if one
parent has allergies, there is a 50% chance the child will have allergies. 
Allergies may also be more common in children who were formula-fed, had a low
birthweight or were exposed to dogs, cats and/or tobacco smoke early in life. 
In addition, infants exposed to high levels of house dust mites during their
first year of life have been shown to have a five-fold increased incidence of
asthma.</P>

<P>
In athletes, physical exercise initially is associated with opening of the nasal
passages.  In some, a rebound congestion of a longer duration can occur which
can impair performance.  In women, allergic rhinitis symptoms may worsen during
pregnancy.  While fewer factors provoke rhinitis in the elderly, treatment needs
to be more tailored due to slower metabolism and the potential for side effects.
 Also, this population is more likely to be taking multiple medications,
including over-the-counter medications, and therefore runs a greater risk of
drug interactions than most other patients.</P>

<P> "Because each of these groups has very special needs, their management and
treatment needs to be individualized," said Sheldon Spector, M.D., clinical
professor of medicine, UCLA School of Medicine. "In young children, for example,
medication dosage should be prescribed according to their size."</P>

<P>The guidelines indicate that for many patients, topical nasal steroids and
antihistamines provide effective treatment.  Based on studies showing that
sedating antihistamines can cause drowsiness and have a negative impact on
thought and function, the guidelines suggest the use of nonsedating agents which
cause no more impairment than placebos.  Some patients require a combination of
agents to control their symptoms.</P>

<P>"Our hope is that the treatment guidelines will help reduce the long-term health
complications and costs often associated with allergies, including associated
chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma, sinusitis and respiratory
infections," said Spector.</P>

<P> To identify individual patient needs, the guidelines include a Patient
Evaluation Form.  This interactive tool asks patients to track their symptoms,
catalogue their family history of allergies and describe the effects of
allergies on daily life.</P>

<P> "We are confident that the patient evaluation form will serve as an effective
tool to involve patients in their healthcare and to assist physicians in
tailoring treatment plans," said Eli O. Meltzer, M.D., clinical professor of
pediatrics, University of California, San Diego. "Our goal is to improve patient
compliance with appropriate therapies and reduce dollars spent on ineffective
treatment."</P>

<P> A free brochure will be made available to consumers through their physicians'
offices.  The brochure highlights the treatment guidelines and includes the
tear-off patient evaluation form.</P>

<P>
The guidelines were developed at a consensus conference convened by the Office
of Continuing Medical Education, UCLA School of Medicine and supported by an
unrestricted educational grant from Schering-Plough Corporation.</P>

<I>A person with IDDM needs daily injections of the hormone

<B>Insulin-Dependent Diabetes</B>
</center>

<h3> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>


<P>     Insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) is a chronic disease
that usually begins in childhood. It is not the most common
form of diabetes--IDDM accounts for only 5 percent or less of
diabetes in this country. Often, though, IDDM has a much
greater impact on a person's life than the more common
adult onset form of diabetes, known as non-insulin dependent
diabetes (NIDDM).</P>

<P>     The onset of IDDM is usually more swift and severe than
that of NIDDM. A child with IDDM can become sick very quickly.
If treatment does not begin shortly after the first symptoms,
the child may need to be hospitalized. Once the diagnosis is
made, a person with IDDM needs daily injections of the hormone
insulin to survive.</P>

<P>     Insulin, discovered in the 1920's, has literally made the
difference between life and death for thousands of people with
IDDM. Insulin is not a cure for diabetes, however. Even with
careful insulin treatment, people who have had diabetes for
years are at greater than average risk of developing problems
that involve the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and
nerves. While most of those with IDDM can lead physically
active and professionally challenging lives, they do not have
the luxury of taking their health for granted.</P>

<P>     Research is adding rapidly to our knowledge of diabetes.
Besides searching for a cure, scientists are learning how to
help people with diabetes enjoy a longer life with fewer health
problems.</P>


<P>IDDM generally occurs in children and adolescents, though it
can appear at any age.</P>


<B>What Is Diabetes?</B>


<P>     Diabetes mellitus impairs the way the body uses digested
food for energy. The sugars and starches (carbohydrates) in the
food we eat are broken down by digestive juices into a simple
sugar called glucose. Glucose circulates in the blood as the
major energy source for the body. For cells in muscles and
other tissues to use glucose for energy, the hormone insulin
must be present. Insulin is produced by the pancreas gland
located behind the stomach. When the right amount of insulin is
present, glucose is either used as fuel for energy or stored in
the liver for future use.</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>     In diabetes, however, the pancreas may not make enough
insulin, or the body does not respond to the insulin that is
present. Sometimes, a person with diabetes can have both these
problems. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood and
tissues, overflows into the urine, and is excreted. Thus, the
body loses its main source of fuel.</P>

<P>     In IDDM the pancreas makes little or no natural insulin,
and a person with IDDM needs daily injections of the hormone to
stay alive. IDDM generally occurs in children and adolescents,
though it can appear at any age. An estimated 300,000 to
500,000 persons in the United States have IDDM. International
statistics on IDDM are unreliable. In general, however, IDDM is
unknown or rare in some ethnic groups, including the Japanese,
Chinese, American Indians, Polynesians, and South African
blacks. On the other hand, Sweden and Finland have very high
rates: in Sweden it is estimated that 3 children in 1,000 have
IDDM versus 1.6 in 1,000 in the United States. The reasons for
these differences are not yet known.</P>


<P>The symptoms of IDDM can be sudden and severe.</P>


<P>     NIDDM is the more common form of diabetes. Of the 11
million Americans who have diabetes, over 95 percent have
NIDDM. Fully half of those with NIDDM don't know they have it.
NIDDM usually occurs after age 40. In NIDDM, the pancreas can
produce insulin, but the body does not use it efficiently. For
this reason, most people with NIDDM can control their diabetes
with careful dieting and regular exercise. When diet and
exercise fail to control NIDDM, insulin or oral drugs can be
used to help control the condition.</P>

<P>     Effective treatment exists for both IDDM and NIDDM. Even
with treatment, however, both types of diabetes can cause
long-term damage to the eyes, nerves, heart, and kidneys. These
complications can lead to blindness, heart attack, stroke,
kidney disease, and serious infections that may require limb
amputation. In IDDM, episodes of very high or low blood sugar
can cause a coma. Careful treatment of diabetes is the most
effective way to minimize the chances of complications.</P>

<h3> <a name="Symptoms">Symptoms</a></h3>

<P>     The symptoms of IDDM can be sudden and severe. They may
include frequent urination, extreme thirst, constant hunger,
blurred vision, and extreme fatigue. Because people with IDDM
lack insulin, glucose builds up in the blood. The kidneys,
trying to remove the excess sugar, excrete large amounts of
water and essential body elements, causing frequent urination
and thirst.</P>

<P>     Because the body cannot use glucose, its first source of
energy, it turns to stored fat and protein for fuel. As the
body uses fat and protein, weight is lost. Breakdown products
of fat collect in blood and raise its acid content. If levels
of these products are high enough, a critical condition called
ketoacidosis can develop, requiring prompt treatment.</P>


<B>How Is Diabetes Treated?</B>


<P>     A person with IDDM must have insulin injections to
survive. Without insulin, symptoms worsen until the patient
loses consciousness and slips into a coma. With daily insulin
shots and a careful diet, however, most people with IDDM can
lead active lives with the same ambitions and challenges as
those without diabetes.</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>A person with IDDM needs to time meals with insulin doses to
keep blood glucose from getting too high or low.</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>     Treatment for IDDM includes a daily routine of insulin
shots or use of an insulin pump. Following a doctor's
instructions, a person with IDDM buys insulin and syringes and
injects himself or herself daily. (The parent of a young child
with IDDM can do this for the child.) More and more people are
also using home blood glucose monitoring devices to measure
their blood glucose during the day. In this way, they can
tailor the insulin dose more closely to changes in their
hour-to-hour blood glucose. Blood glucose monitoring is a more
accurate way to monitor diabetes treatment than urine testing.</P>

<P>     Eating the right foods at the right time is an important
part of treatment. A person with IDDM needs to time meals with
insulin doses to keep blood glucose from getting too high or
low. The foods you choose can play a role in controlling blood
glucose levels, too. Increasing the proportion of fiber and
complex carbohydrates in your diet and avoiding refined sugar
may aid in reducing drastic changes in blood glucose and may,
in some people, permit lowering of insulin dose. Foods
containing fiber include beans, whole grains, and some fruits,
while complex carbohydrates, or starches, include potatoes,
rice, and pasta.</P>

<P>     Reducing fats and cholesterol can help reduce the risk of
heart disease, which affects people with diabetes more often
than those with normal glucose metabolism.</P>

<P>     Exercise, like diet, can help reduce the risk of heart
disease. Being fit can also bring a sense of well-being and
strength that has special meaning for someone with a chronic
illness like diabetes.</P>

<P>     Exercise carefully, though. Strenuous exercise increases
the muscles' use of glucose, so it can lower glucose in the
blood. At the same time, exercise also stimulates the body to
release glucose and fats for use as energy. This stimulus can
have the effect of raising blood glucose. In order to exercise
safely, you should balance insulin dose, meals, and the timing
of exercise to keep blood glucose levels from getting too high
or too low.</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<B>What Causes Diabetes?</B>


<P>     No one knows exactly what causes IDDM. What is clear is
that the body's own immune or disease-fighting system for some
reason turns against the body's own tissues. Certain substances
formed by the immune system attack the beta cells of the
pancreas, destroying their ability to make insulin.</P>

<P>     Research shows that most, if not all, people with IDDM may
inherit traits that put them at risk for IDDM. However, not
everyone who inherits these traits develops IDDM. One or more
factors in the environment are believed to trigger the immune
system to destroy the insulin-producing cells. In some cases,
the trigger may be a viral infection. Scientists have, in a few
cases, been able to link the onset of diabetes with a virus. In
most cases, however, the trigger for diabetes is unknown.</P>

<h3> <a name="Complications of Diabetes">Complications of Diabetes</a></h3>


<P>     The discovery of insulin in 1921 lengthened the lives of
people with IDDM from weeks or months to decades. In spite of
insulin's life-preserving effects, diabetes remains a deadly
disease. This fact is largely due to the complications of
diabetes that develop over many years of insulin treatment. The
complications affect the heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Much
of the damage done to these organs involves changes in small
blood vessels throughout the body. Research is under way to
determine whether very careful control of blood glucose can
prevent or delay diabetic complications. Studies are also under
way to determine why some people with IDDM have trouble with
complications while others live long, relatively healthy lives.</P>

<P>     Until the answers to these questions are known, it is wise
for people with IDDM to follow their doctor's advice in
controlling blood glucose and to be aware of the signs and risk
factors for complications of diabetes.</P>


<B>Acute Complications</B>


<P>     The acute complications of diabetes are the rapid effects
that can occur when blood glucose levels climb too high or fall
too low. If an insulin injection is missed, for example, blood
glucose rises, and the person affected may start to feel weak
and hungry, and may urinate frequently. Since the body can't
use glucose for energy, it shifts to using fats and protein.
The products of fat and protein metabolism, substances called
ketones, are toxic when they reach high enough levels. This
condition is called ketoacidosis, and it can cause coma and
death if untreated. Ketoacidosis can develop slowly over
several days. The warning symptoms may include abdominal pain,
nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and a fruity odor on the
person's breath, and drowsiness.</P>


<P>Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include trembling, nervousness,
sweating, hunger, headache, nausea, drowsiness, or a feeling
similar to drunkenness.</P>


<P>     Glucose can also fall too low in diabetes. Going too long
without a meal, engaging in strenuous exercise, or taking too
large a dose of insulin can cause glucose to drop, a condition
called hypoglycemia, or insulin shock. Common symptoms of
hypoglycemia include trembling, nervousness, sweating, hunger,
headache, nausea, drowsiness, or a feeling similar to
drunkenness. Like ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia can cause coma and
death if untreated. A quick, sugar-rich snack or drink such as
orange juice or an injection of glucagon, a hormone that raises
glucose levels, can restore normal glucose levels.</P>


<B>Long-Term Complications</B>


<P>     In young people, acute complications pose the greatest
threat to survival for people with IDDM. As people grow older,
the long-term complications become more important. Diabetes can
damage many organs through its effects on blood vessels. How
this occurs is not well understood, but the damage can lead to
kidney, heart, eye, and nerve disease.</P>


<B>Kidney Disease</B>


<P>     Kidney disease is the greatest threat to life in adults
with IDDM. The kidneys have a complex network of small blood
vessels that filter impurities from blood for excretion in
urine. Diabetes can damage these small blood vessels so that
the kidneys cannot perform their waste-filtering work. The
kidneys are essential to life. People can live without one
kidney, but those who lose both must have their blood cleansed
by a dialysis machine or have a kidney transplant.</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>Diabetes doubles the risk of heart disease.</P>


<P>     High blood pressure can increase the chances that someone
will develop kidney disease, so keeping blood pressure under
control is especially important for someone with IDDM.</P>


<B>Heart Disease</B>


<P>     Diabetes doubles the risk of heart disease. For reasons
not yet well understood, fat and cholesterol collect more
rapidly in the arteries of people with diabetes than in those
without diabetes. These fatty deposits reduce the supply of
blood to the heart and can lead to a heart attack.</P>

<P>     Other risk factors for heart disease include hypertension
or high blood pressure, obesity, high amounts of fats and
cholesterol in blood, and cigarette smoking. The more these
factors can be eliminated, the more a person reduces the risk
of heart disease.</P>


<B>Eye Disease</B>


<P>     The major threat to vision from diabetes is diabetic
retinopathy. Retinopathy means disease of the retina, the
light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye. Diabetes causes
changes in the tiny vessels that supply the retina with blood.
The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid. When retinopathy is
more severe, new blood vessels may grow from the back of the
eye and bleed into the clear gel, or vitreous, that fills the
eye.</P>

<P>     A yearly eye examination enables an eye doctor to detect
changes before vision is affected and eye disease becomes
harder to treat. Scientists have found that laser treatment for
diabetic retinopathy can help prevent loss of vision and can,
in some cases, restore vision lost as a result of this disease.
A yearly eye exam by an eye doctor is the best way to make sure
that changes in eyesight are diagnosed early and that effective
treatment is carried out when it can be most helpful.</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>A yearly eye exam by an eye doctor is the best way to make
sure that changes in eyesight are diagnosed early.</P>


<B>Diabetic Nerve Disease
</B>

<P>    Nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy) can dull
sensation in the feet, legs, and fingertips. When this happens,
bruises or sores may go unnoticed until they become open or
infected. Reduced blood flow caused by diabetes' effects on the
blood vessels (peripheral vascular disease) can slow healing of
foot sores. Because of diabetic neuropathy and peripheral
vascular disease, people with diabetes are at increased risk of
needing amputation when leg and foot sores become gravely
infected.</P>

<P>     Severe pain in the legs and feet sometimes comes with
diabetic neuropathy. Pain-killing drugs and sometimes
antidepressant drugs are used to treat painful neuropathy. In
most cases, the pain subsides on its own with time.</P>

<P>     Diabetic neuropathy can also affect body functions such as
digestion. A doctor may prescribe drugs to relieve these
symptoms. In addition, diabetes can, over time, affect the
nerves that control erection in men. A doctor can find out
whether impotence is the result of emotional or physical
changes, such as diabetes, and then suggest treatment or
counseling.</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>A mother's careful control of her glucose is essential to the
health and life of her baby.</P>


<B>Pregnancy</B>


<P>     With insulin treatment available, IDDM no longer poses the
threat it once did to the health of the pregnant mother. The
infant of a mother with IDDM does, however, have a higher than
average risk of birth defects, stillbirth, respiratory
distress, and other problems at birth. A mother's careful
control of her glucose is essential to the health and life of
her baby. With careful diabetes control, beginning before
conception if possible, it is likely that the child will be
healthy in every way.</P>


<P>Does Diabetes Run in Families?</P>


<P>     A susceptibility to diabetes can be inherited. The
brothers and sisters of a child with diabetes have a higher
than average risk of developing IDDM. However, their risk
remains small--only about 1 in 20 children with a diabetic
sibling will develop IDDM. In fact, an identical twin of a
child with IDDM has less than a 50 percent chance of developing
the disease. Scientists are still doing research to determine
how and why certain factors--both inherited and
environmental--sometimes lead to diabetes.</P>


<B>Illness and Surgery
</B>

<P>     Illness, such as influenza, and stress, such as personal
losses or conflicts, can affect the body's use of glucose.
During times of illness and stress, a person needs to be even
more careful about keeping glucose in control.</P>

<P>     Surgery also places unusual stress on the body. Surgical
teams take special precautions when doing surgery on a person
with IDDM. The best way to ensure that doctors are aware of a
patient's diabetes is to tell them.</P>

<h3> <a name="Research in Diabetes">Research in Diabetes</a></h3>



<P>     Diabetes research is the best hope that one day a means of
curing and possibly preventing diabetes will be found. In the
last 10 years, diabetes researchers have made great strides in
understanding this disease. Critical to this effort has been
the technology developed in genetics, microbiology, immunology,
and other disciplines that have given diabetes researchers the
tools they need to examine at the cell level what happens in
diabetes.</P>

<P>     The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) was established by Congress in 1950 as
an institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), whose
mission is to improve human health through biomedical research.
The NIH is the research arm of the Public Health Service under
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</P>

<P>     The NIDDK conducts and supports a variety of research in
diabetes and its complications. In the past several years,
scientists have identified the genetic factors that are
associated with both IDDM and NIDDM. A major goal of future
research will be to clarify how inherited factors affect the
immune or disease-fighting system to result in IDDM. Already,
scientists have identified immune factors circulating in blood
that indicate increased risk of developing IDDM. This
information may lead to early identification of IDDM cases and
will help pave the way to understanding why the immune system
goes awry in IDDM.</P>

<P>     Scientists also have a better understanding of how insulin
works in glucose metabolism. For example, groups of researchers
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York; the
University of California, San Francisco; Mr. Zion Hospital and
Medical Center, San Francisco; and Stanford University,
Stanford, California, recently cloned and analyzed the
structure of the insulin receptor, a molecule on cell surfaces
to which insulin must attach in order to act. Defects in
receptor function have been linked to abnormalities in glucose
metabolism.</P>

<P>     Human insulin made by recombinant DNA techniques is
commercially available, as are externally worn pumps that can
be programmed by the wearer to deliver insulin through a
catheter in the abdomen. Research is continuing on internally
implantable pumps, and clinical trials on at least one such
pump have been undertaken.</P>

<P>     New treatments are being developed for the complications
of diabetes. Laser photocoagulation therapy has been shown to
reduce the risk of blindness in people with diabetic
retinopathy. Preventive measures and medications are available
to help control high blood pressure, to avoid lower extremity
amputations, and to reduce the risk of tooth loss from
periodontal (gum)disease. Understanding how maternal diabetes
can affect the unborn child is increasing, and with it,
strategies to improve the chances that such a child will be
born normal and healthy.</P>

<P>     Research on transplantation of the insulin producing cells
of the pancreas is ongoing. The aim of this research is to
provide a means of transplanting insulin-producing cells into
someone with diabetes without the need to suppress the immune
system to prevent rejection. If successful, the procedure would
eliminate the need for daily injections of insulin.</P>


<B>Clinical Trials</B>


<P>     Clinical trials are one means to test new approaches to
treatment that emerge from basic research. In a clinical trial,
new and existing treatments are compared with each other or
with no treatment.</P>

<P>     The NIDDK is supporting and planning clinical trials that
are designed to weigh the benefits and risks of various
approaches to treatment of diabetes and its complications. For
information about NIDDK-supported clinical trials, contact the
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room

<P>MESSAGE FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH</P>

<P>     Research conducted and supported by the National Institute

of Mental Health brings hope to millions of people who suffer

from mental illness and to their families and friends. During the

past 10 years, researchers have advanced our understanding of the

brain and vastly expanded the capability of mental health

professionals to diagnose, treat, and prevent mental and brain

disorders.</P>

<P>     Now, in the 1990s, which the President and Congress have

declared the "Decade of the Brain," we stand at the threshold of

a new era in brain and behavioral sciences. Through research, we

will learn even more about mental disorders such as depression,

bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, panic disorder, and obsessive-

compulsive disorder. And we will be able to use this knowledge to

develop new therapies that can help more people overcome mental

illness.</P>

<h3> <a name="What is OCD">What is OCD?</a></h3>



<P>     In the mental illness called obsessive compulsive disorder

(OCD), a person becomes trapped in a pattern of repetitive

thoughts and behaviors that are senseless and distressing but

extremely difficult to overcome. The following are typical

examples of OCD:</P>

<P>     Troubled by repeated thoughts that she may have contaminated

herself by touching doorknobs and other "dirty" objects, a

teenage girl spends hours every day washing her hands. Her hands

are red and raw, and she has little time for social activities.  </P>

<P>     A middle-aged man is tormented by the notion that he may

injure others through carelessness. He has difficulty leaving his

home because he must first go through a lengthy ritual of

checking and rechecking the gas jets and water faucets to make

certain that they are turned off.</P>

<P>     Several times a day, a young mother is seized by the fearful

thought that she is going to harm her child. However hard she

tries, she cannot get rid of this painful and worrisome idea. She

even refuses to touch the kitchen knives and other sharp objects

because she is afraid that she may use them as weapons.</P>

<P>     If OCD becomes severe enough, it can destroy a person's

capacity to function in the home, at work, or at school. That is

why it is important to learn about the disorder and the

treatments that are now available.</P>

<h3> <a name="How Common is OCD">How Common is OCD?</a></h3>





<P>     For many years, mental health professionals thought of OCD

as a very rare disease because only a small minority of their

patients had the condition. But it is believed that many of those

afflicted with OCD, in efforts to keep their repetitive thoughts

and behaviors secret, fail to seek treatment. This had led to

underestimates of the number of people with the illness. However,

a recent survey by the National Institute of Mental Health

(NIMH)--the Federal agency that supports research nationwide on

the brain, mental illnesses, and mental health--has provided new

understanding about the prevalence of OCD. The NIMH survey shows

that this disorder may affect as much as 2 percent of the

population, meaning that OCD is more common than schizophrenia

and other severe mental illnesses.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3> <a name="Key Features of OCD">Key Features of OCD</a></h3>

<B>Obssessions</B><BR>

<P>     These are unwanted ideas or impulses that repeatedly well up

in the mind of the person with OCD. Again and again, the

individual experiences a disturbing thought, such as, "My hands

may be contaminated--I must wash them"; "I may have left the gas

on"; or "I am going to injure my child." These thoughts are felt

to be intrusive and unpleasant. They produce anxiety.</P>



<B>Compulsions</B><BR>

<P>     To deal with their anxiety, most people with OCD resort to

repetitive behaviors called compulsions. The most common of these

are washing and checking, as in the first two previous examples.

Other compulsive behaviors include counting (often while

performing another compulsive action such as hand washing) and

endlessly rearranging objects in an effort to keep them in

perfect alignment or symmetry with each other. These behaviors

generally are intended to ward off harm to the person with OCD or

others. They are usually quite stereotyped, with little variation

from one time to the next, and are often referred to as rituals.

Performing these rituals may give the person with OCD some relief

from anxiety, but it is only temporary.  </P>



<B>Insight</B><BR>

<P>     People with OCD generally have considerable insight into

their own problems. Most of the time, they know that their

obsessive thoughts are senseless or exaggerated, and that their

compulsive behaviors are not really necessary. However, this

knowledge is not sufficient to enable them to break free from

their illness.  </P>



<B>Resistance</B><BR>

<P>     Most people with OCD struggle to banish their unwanted,

obsessive thoughts and to prevent themselves from engaging in

compulsive behaviors. Many are able to keep their obsessive-

compulsive symptoms under control during the hours when they are

at work or attending school. But over the months or years,

resistance may weaken, and when this happens, OCD may become so

severe that time-consuming rituals take over the person's life

and make it impossible for him or her to continue activities

outside the home.</P>



<B>Shame and Secrecy</B><BR>

<P>     People with OCD generally attempt to hide their problem

rather than seek help. Often they are remarkably successful in

concealing their obsessive-compulsive symptoms from friends and

coworkers. An unfortunate consequence of this secrecy is that

people with OCD usually do not receive professional help until

years after the onset of their disease. By that time, obsessive-

compulsive habits may be deeply ingrained and very difficult to

change.</P>



<B>Interference</B><BR>

<P>     A person is not considered to have OCD unless the obsessive

and compulsive behaviors are extreme enough to interfere with

everyday life. People with OCD should not be confused with a much

larger group of individuals who are sometimes called "compulsive"

because they hold themselves to a high standard of performance in

their work and even in recreational activities. This type of

"compulsiveness" often serves a valuable purpose, contributing to

a person's self-esteem and success on the job. In that respect,

it differs from the life-wrecking obsessions and rituals of the

person with OCD.  </P>



<B>Long-Lasting Symptoms</B><BR>

<P>     OCD tends to last for years, even decades. The symptoms may

become less severe from time to time, and there may be long

intervals when the symptoms are mild, but generally OCD is a

chronic disease.</P>



<B>Who Gets OCD?</B><BR>

<P>     OCD strikes people of all ethnic groups. Both males and

females are affected. Typically, the symptoms begin during the

teenage years or young adulthood.</P>

<h3> <a name="Treatment of OCD">Treatment of OCD:</a></h3>


<B>PROGRESS THROUGH RESEARCH</B>

<P>     Clinical and animal research sponsored by NIMH and other

scientific organizations is yielding treatments that can help the

person with OCD. Descriptions of two of these therapies follow:</P>



<B>TREATMENT USING MEDICATIONS</B>

<P>     A medication called clomipramine can relieve the symptoms of

OCD in many people. Clomipramine belongs to a group of

medications called the tricyclic antidepressants, which are

widely used for the treatment of depressive illness. Several

studies have shown, however, that clomipramine can be of benefit

to sufferers of OCD who are not depressed as well as those who

are. Two other medications--fluvoxamine and fluoxetine--may also

be effective in the treatment of OCD. These medications, like

clomipramine, enhance the brain's ability to utilize the

naturally occurring brain chemical serotonin. Scientists on the

staff of NIMH and others receiving grant support from the

Institute are among those investigating medications to treat OCD. </P>



<B>BEHAVIOR THERAPY</B>

<P>     Traditional psychotherapy, aimed at helping the patient

develop insight into his or her problem, is generally not

effective against OCD. However, a behavior therapy approach

called "exposure and response prevention" has been found to be

effective for many people with OCD. In this approach, the patient

is deliberately exposed to the feared object or idea, either

directly or by imagination, and then is discouraged or prevented

from carrying out the usual compulsive response. For example, a

compulsive hand washer may be urged to touch an object believed

to be contaminated, and then may be denied the opportunity to

wash for several hours. When the treatment works well, the

patient gradually experiences less anxiety from the obsessive

thoughts and becomes able to do without the compulsive actions

for extended periods of time. In research supported by NIMH,

investigators at Temple University in Philadelphia evaluated

their own version of this method and found that three- fourths of

the patients enrolled in the study improved.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3> <a name="Causes of OCD">Causes of OCD</a></h3>



<P>     The fact that OCD patients respond well to specific

medications suggests the disorder has a neurobiological basis.

For that reason, OCD is no longer attributed to attitudes a

patient learned in childhood--for example, an inordinate emphasis

on cleanliness, or a belief that certain thoughts are dangerous

or unacceptable. Instead, the search for causes now focuses on

the interaction of neurobiological factors and environmental

influences. It is believed that people who develop OCD have a

biological predisposition to react strongly to stress, that this

reaction takes the form of intrusive, distressing thoughts, and

that these thoughts lead to more anxiety and stress, eventually

creating a vicious circle the person cannot escape without help.</P>

<P>     In an effort to identify specific biological factors that

may be important in the onset or persistence of OCD, NIMH-

supported investigators have used a device called the positron

emission tomography (PET) scanner to study the brains of patients

with OCD. Several groups of investigators have obtained findings

from PET scans suggesting that OCD patients have patterns of

brain activity that differ from those of people without mental

illness or with some other mental illness. Brain imaging studies

of OCD showing abnormal neuro-chemical activity in regions known

to play a role in certain neurological disorders suggest that

these areas may be crucial in the origins of OCD. Symptoms of

OCD, although not the full syndrome, are seen in association with

some other neurological disorders. These include Tourette's

syndrome, a condition that runs in families and is characterized

by rapid, involuntary, repetitive movements and vocalizations.

Genetic studies of OCD and other related conditions may someday

enable scientists to pinpoint the molecular basis of these

disorders.</P>

<P>     The ongoing search for causes, together with research on

treatment, promises to yield even more hope for people with OCD

and their families. Congress has designated the 1990s as the

Decade of the Brain to make improved prevention, diagnosis,

treatment, and rehabilitation of brain and mental disorders a

national research priority.  </P>

<h3> <a name="How to Get Help For OCD">How to Get Help for OCD</a></h3>



<P>     If you think that you have OCD, you should seek the help of

a mental health professional. Family physicians, clinics, and

health maintenance organizations usually can provide referrals to

mental health centers and specialists. Also, the department of

psychiatry at a major medical center or the department of

psychology at a university may have specialists who are

knowledgeable about the treatment of OCD and able to provide

therapy or recommend another doctor in the area.</P>

<h3> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<P>     In the early 1970s, a mysterious clustering of arthritis

occurred among children in Lyme, Connecticut, and surrounding

towns. Medical researchers soon recognized the illness as a

distinct disease, which they called Lyme disease. They

subsequently described the clinical features of Lyme disease,

established the usefulness of antibiotic therapy in its

treatment, identified the deer tick as the key to its spread,

and isolated the bacterium that caused it.</P>



<P>     Lyme disease is still mistaken for other ailments, and it

continues to pose many other challenges: it can be difficult to

diagnose because of the inadequacies of today's laboratory

tests; it can be troublesome to treat in its later phases; and

its prevention through the development of an effective vaccine

is hampered by the elusive nature of the bacterium.</P>



<P>     The National Institutes of Health (NIH), a part of the

U.S. Public Health Service, conducts and supports biomedical

research aimed at meeting the challenges of Lyme disease. This

brochure presents the most recently available information on

the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3> <a name="How Lyme Disease Became Known">How Lyme Disease Became
Known</a></h3>



<P>     Lyme disease was first recognized in 1975 after

researchers investigated why unusually large numbers of

children were being diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid

arthritis in Lyme and two neighboring towns. The investigators

discovered that most of the affected children lived near wooded

areas likely to harbor ticks. They also found that the

children's first symptoms typically started in the summer

months coinciding with the height of the tick season. Several

of the patients interviewed reported having a skin rash just

before developing their arthritis, and many also recalled being

bitten by a tick at the rash site.</P>



<P>     Further investigations resulted in the discovery that tiny

deer ticks infected with a spiral-shaped bacterium or

spirochete (which was later named Borrelia burgdorferi) were

responsible for the outbreak of arthritis in Lyme.</P>



<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>



<P>Ticks that Most Commonly Transmit B. burgdorferi in the U.S.

(These ticks are all quite similar in appearance.)</P>



<P><I>Ixodes dammini</I>--most common in the northeast and midwest</P>



<P><I>Ixodes scapularis</I>--found in south and southeast</P>



<P><I>Ixodes pacificus</I>--found on the west coast</P>





<P>     In Europe, a skin rash similar to that of Lyme disease had

been described in medical literature dating back to the turn of

the century. Lyme disease may have spread from Europe to the

United States in the early 1900s but only recently became

common enough to be detected.</P>



<P>     The ticks most commonly infected with B. burgdorferi

usually feed and mate on deer during part of their life cycle.

The recent resurgence of the deer population in the northeast

and the influx of suburban developments into rural areas where

deer ticks are commonly found have probably contributed to the

disease's rising prevalence.</P>



<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>



<P>     The number of reported cases of Lyme disease, as well as

the number of geographic areas in which it is found, has been

increasing. Lyme disease has been reported in nearly all states

in this country, although most cases are concentrated in the

coastal northeast, mid-Atlantic states, Wisconsin and

Minnesota, and northern California. Lyme disease is endemic in

large areas of Asia and Europe. Recent reports suggest that it

is present in South America, too.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<h3> <a name="Symptoms of Lyme Disease">Symptoms of Lyme Disease</a></h3>

<P>     <B>Erythema Migrans.</B> In most people, the first symptom of

Lyme disease is a red rash known as erythema migrans (EM). The

telltale rash starts as a small red spot that expands over a

period of days or weeks, forming a circular, triangular, or

oval-shaped rash. Sometimes the rash resembles a bull's eye

because it appears as a red ring surrounding a central clear

area. The rash, which can range in size from that of a dime to

the entire width of a person's back, appears within a few weeks

of a tick bite and usually occurs at the site of a bite. As

infection spreads, several rashes can appear at different sites

on the body.</P>



<P>[Graphic Omitted] </P>



<P>     Erythema migrans is often accompanied by symptoms such as

fever, headache, stiff neck, body aches, and fatigue. Although

these flu-like symptoms may resemble those of common viral

infections, Lyme disease symptoms tend to persist or may occur

intermittently.</P>



<P>     <B>Arthritis.</B> After several months of being infected by B.

burgdorferi, slightly more than half of those people not

treated with antibiotics develop recurrent attacks of painful

and swollen joints that last a few days to a few months. The

arthritis can shift from one joint to another; the knee is most

commonly affected. About 10 to 20 percent of untreated patients

will go on to develop chronic arthritis.</P>



<P>    <B> Neurological Symptoms.</B> Lyme disease can also affect the

nervous system, causing symptoms such as stiff neck and severe

headache (meningitis), temporary paralysis of facial muscles

(Bell's palsy), numbness, pain or weakness in the limbs, or

poor motor coordination. More subtle changes such as memory

loss, difficulty with concentration, and a change in mood or

sleeping habits have also been associated with Lyme disease.</P>



<P>     <B>Nervous system</B> abnormalities usually develop several

weeks, months, or even years following an untreated infection.

These symptoms often last for weeks or months and may recur.</P>



<P>     <B>Heart Problems.</B> Fewer than one out of ten Lyme disease

patients develops heart problems, such as an irregular

heartbeat, which can be signalled by dizziness or shortness of

breath. These symptoms rarely last more than a few days or

weeks. Such heart abnormalities generally surface several weeks

after infection.</P>



<P>     <B>Other Symptoms.</B> Less commonly, Lyme disease can result in

eye inflammation, hepatitis, and severe fatigue, although none

of these problems is likely to appear without other Lyme

disease symptoms being present.</P>

<h3> <a name="How Lyme Disease Is Diagnosed">How Lyme Disease Is
Diagnosed</a></h3>

<P>     Lyme disease may be difficult to diagnose because many of

its symptoms mimic those of other disorders. In addition, the

only distinctive hallmark unique to Lyme disease--the erythema

migrans rash--is absent in at least one-fourth of the people who

become infected. Although a tick bite is an important clue for

diagnosis, many patients cannot recall having been bitten

recently by a tick. This is not surprising because the tick is

tiny, and a tick bite is usually painless.</P>



<P>     When a patient with possible Lyme disease symptoms does

not develop the distinctive rash, a physician will rely on a

detailed medical history and a careful physical examination for

essential clues to diagnosis, with laboratory tests playing a

supportive role.</P>

<P>     Blood Tests. Unfortunately, the Lyme disease microbe

itself is difficult to isolate or culture from body tissues or

fluids. Most physicians look for evidence of antibodies against

B. burgdorferi in the blood to confirm the bacterium's role as

the cause of a patient's symptoms. Antibodies are molecules or

small substances tailor-made by the immune system to lock onto

and destroy specific microbial invaders.</P>



<P>     Some patients experiencing nervous system symptoms may

also undergo a spinal tap. Through this procedure doctors can

detect brain and spinal cord inflammation and can look for

antibodies in the spinal fluid.</P>



<P>     The inadequacies of the currently available antibody tests

may prevent them from firmly establishing whether the Lyme

disease bacterium is causing a patient's symptoms. In the first

few weeks following infection, antibody tests are not reliable

because a patient's immune system has not produced enough

antibodies to be detected. Antibiotics given to a patient early

during infection may also prevent antibodies from reaching

detectable levels, even though the Lyme disease bacterium is

the cause of the patient's symptoms.</P>



<P>     Because some tests cannot distinguish Lyme disease

antibodies from antibodies to similar organisms, patients may

test positive for Lyme disease when their symptoms actually

stem from other bacterial infections. A lack of standardization

of antibody tests and poor quality control also contribute to

inaccuracies in test results.</P>



<P>     Due to these pitfalls, physicians must rely on their

clinical judgement in diagnosing someone with Lyme disease even

though the patient does not have the distinctive erythema

migrans rash. Such a diagnosis would be based on the history of

a tick bite, the patient's symptoms, a thorough ruling out of

other diseases that might cause those symptoms, and other

implicating evidence. This evidence could include such factors

as an initial appearance of symptoms during the summer months

when tick bites are most likely to occur, outdoor exposure in

an area where Lyme disease is common, and a clustering of Lyme

disease symptoms among family members.</P>



<P>     <B>New Tests Under Development.</B>To improve the accuracy of

Lyme disease diagnosis, NIH-supported researchers are

developing a number of new tests that promise to be more

reliable than currently available procedures. Some of these

detect distinctive protein fragments of the Lyme disease

bacterium in fluid samples.</P>



<P>     NIH scientists are developing tests that use the highly

sensitive genetic engineering technique, known as polymerase

chain reaction (PCR), to detect extremely small quantities of

the genetic material of the Lyme disease bacterium in body

tissues and fluids.</P>



<P>     Several new methods to detect infection are under

development in NIH laboratories. Scientists have isolated a

protein of B. burgdorferi, called p39, that reacts strongly on

blood tests. The presence of antibodies to this protein was

found to be a strong indicator of the presence of B.

burgdorferi. Although further research will be needed to

determine how soon after infection it can detect the bacterium,

p39 may prove to be an ideal test for Lyme disease.</P>



<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>



<P>     A somewhat different approach is the use of an assay based

on two closely related spirochetal proteins that are not found

in other species of bacterial spirochetes. This assay differs

from blood tests now in use because it detects products of the

spirochete itself rather than detecting human antibodies to the

bacterium.</P>

<h3> <a name="How Lyme Disease Is Treated">How Lyme Disease Is Treated</a></h3>

<P>     Nearly all Lyme disease patients can be effectively

treated with an appropriate course of antibiotic therapy. In

general, the sooner such therapy is begun following infection,

the quicker and more complete the recovery.</P>



<P>     Antibiotics, such as doxycycline or amoxicillin taken

orally for a few weeks, can speed the healing of the erythema

migrans rash and usually prevent subsequent symptoms such as

arthritis or neurological problems.</P>



<P>     Patients younger than 9 years or pregnant or lactating

women with Lyme disease are treated with amoxicillin or

penicillin because doxycycline can stain the permanent teeth

developing in young children or unborn babies. Patients

allergic to penicillin are given erythromycin.</P>



<P>     Lyme disease patients with neurological symptoms are

usually treated with the antibiotic ceftriaxone given

intravenously once a day for a month or less. Most patients

experience full recovery.</P>



<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>



<P>     Lyme arthritis may be treated with oral antibiotics.

Patients with severe arthritis may be treated with ceftriaxone

or penicillin given intravenously. To ease these patients'

discomfort and further their healing, the physician might also

give anti-inflammatory drugs, draw fluid from affected joints,

or surgically remove the inflamed lining of the joints.</P>



<P>     Lyme arthritis resolves in most patients within a few

weeks or months following antibiotic therapy, although it can

take years to disappear completely in some people. Some Lyme

disease patients who are untreated for several years may be

cured of their arthritis with the proper antibiotic regimen. If

the disease has persisted long enough, however, it may

irreversibly damage the structure of the joints.</P>



<P>     Physicians prefer to treat Lyme disease patients

experiencing heart symptoms with antibiotics such as

ceftriaxone or penicillin given intravenously for about 2

weeks. If these symptoms persist or are severe enough, patients

may also be treated with corticosteroids or given a temporary

internal cardiac pacemaker. People with Lyme disease rarely

experience long-term heart damage.</P>



<P>     Following treatment for Lyme disease, some people still

have persistent fatigue and achiness. This general malaise can

take months to subside, although it generally does so

spontaneously without requiring additional antibiotic therapy.</P>



<P>     Researchers are currently conducting studies to assess the

optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for the various

manifestations of Lyme disease. Investigators are also testing

newly developed antibiotics for their effectiveness in

countering the Lyme disease bacterium.</P>



<P>     Unfortunately, a bout with Lyme disease is no guarantee

that the illness will be prevented in the future. The disease

can strike more than once in the same individual if he or she

is reinfected with the Lyme disease bacterium.</P>

<h3> <a name="Lyme Disease Prevention">Lyme Disease Prevention</a></h3>

<P>    <B> Avoidance of Ticks.</B> At present, the best way to avoid Lyme

disease is to avoid deer ticks. Although generally only about

one percent of all deer ticks are infected with the Lyme

disease bacterium, in some areas more than half of them harbor

the microbe.</P>



<P>    Most people with Lyme disease become infected during the

summer, when immature ticks are most prevalent. Except in warm

climates, few people are bitten by deer ticks during winter

months.</P>



<P>     Deer ticks are most often found in wooded areas and nearby

grasslands, and are especially common where the two areas

merge. Because the adult ticks feed on deer, areas where deer

are frequently seen are likely to harbor sizable numbers of

deer ticks.</P>



<P>     To help prevent tick bites, people entering tick-infested

areas should walk in the center of trails to avoid picking up

ticks from overhanging grass and brush.</P>



<P>     To minimize skin exposure to both ticks and insect

repellents, people outdoors in tick-infested areas should wear

long pants and long-sleeved shirts that fit tightly at the

ankles and wrists. As a further safeguard, people should wear a

hat, tuck pant legs into socks, and wear shoes that leave no

part of the feet exposed. To make it easy to detect ticks,

people should wear light-colored clothing.</P>



<P>     To repel ticks, people can spray their clothing with the

insecticide permethrin, which is commonly found in lawn and

garden stores. Insect repellents that contain a chemical called

DEET (N,N-diethyl-M-toluamide) can also be applied to clothing

or directly onto skin. Although highly effective, these

repellents can cause some serious side effects, particularly

when high concentrations are used repeatedly on the skin.

Infants and children may be especially at risk for adverse

reactions to DEET.</P>



<P>     Pregnant women should be especially careful to avoid ticks

in Lyme disease areas because the infection can be transferred

to the unborn child. Such a prenatal infection can make the

woman more likely to miscarry or deliver a stillborn baby.</P>



<P>     <B>Checking for Ticks.</B> Once indoors, people should check

themselves and their children for ticks, particularly in the

hairy regions of the body. The immature deer ticks that are

most likely to cause Lyme disease are only about the size of a

poppy seed, so they are easily mistaken for a freckle or a

speck of dirt. All clothing should be washed. Pets should be

checked for ticks before entering the house, because they, too,

can develop symptoms of Lyme disease. In addition, a pet can

carry ticks into the house. These ticks could fall off without

biting the animal and subsequently attach to and bite people

inside the house.</P>



<P>     If a tick is discovered attached to the skin, it should be

pulled out gently with tweezers, taking care not to squeeze the

tick's body. An antiseptic should then be applied to the bite.

Studies by NIH-supported researchers suggest that a tick must

be attached for many hours to transmit the Lyme disease

bacterium, so prompt tick removal could prevent the disease.</P>



<P>     The risk of developing Lyme disease from a tick bite is

small, even in heavily infested areas, and most physicians

prefer not to treat patients bitten by ticks with antibiotics

unless they develop symptoms of Lyme disease.</P>



<P>     <B>Vaccine Development.</B> Because Lyme disease is difficult to

diagnose and sometimes does not respond to treatment,

researchers are trying to create a vaccine that will protect

people from the disorder. Vaccines work in part by prompting

the body to generate antibodies. These custom-shaped molecules

lock onto specific proteins made by a virus or bacterium--often

those proteins lodged in the microbe's outer coat. Once

antibodies attach to an invading microbe, other immune defenses

are evoked to destroy it.</P>





<P><B>Tips for Personal Protection</B></P>

<ul>



  <li> Avoid tick-infested areas, especially in May, June, and

     July.*



  <li> Wear light-colored clothing so that ticks can be easily

     spotted.



  <li> Wear long-sleeved shirts and closed shoes and socks.



  <li> Tuck pant legs into socks or boots and tuck shirt into

     pants



   <li> Apply insect repellant containing permethrin to pants,

     socks, and shoes, and compounds containing DEET on

     exposed skin. Do not overuse these products.



  <li> Walk in the center of trails to avoid overgrown grass and

     brush.



  <li> After being outdoors in a tick-infested area, remove,

     wash, and dry clothing.



  <li> Inspect the body thoroughly and remove carefully any

     attached ticks.



   <li> Check pets for ticks.

</ul>



<P>* Local health departments and park or agricultural extension

services may have information on the seasonal and geographical

distribution of ticks in your area.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<h3> <a name="How to Remove a Tick">How to Remove a Tick</a></h3>

<ul>

   <li> Tug gently but firmly with blunt tweezers near the "head"

     of the tick until it releases its hold on the skin.



  <li> To lessen the chance of contact with the bacterium, try

     not to crush the tick's body or handle the tick with bare

     fingers.



   <li> Swab the bite area thoroughly with an antiseptic to

     prevent bacterial infection.

</ul>

<P>     Development of an effective vaccine for Lyme disease has

been difficult to create for a number of reasons. Scientists

need to find out how the immune system protects against the

bacterium because people who have been infected once can acquire

the infection again. In addition, there are several different

strains of the bacterium, each with its own distinct set of

proteins, and bacteria within an individual strain may change

the shape of their proteins over time so that antibodies can no

longer identify and lock onto them.</P>



<P>     <B>Tick Eradication.</B> In the meantime, researchers are trying

to develop an effective strategy for ridding areas of deer

ticks. Studies show that a single fall spraying of pesticide in

wooded areas can substantially reduce the number of adult deer

ticks residing there for as long as a year. Spraying on a large

scale, however, may not be economically feasible and may prompt

environmental or health concerns.</P>



<P>     Scientists are also pursuing biological control of deer

ticks by introducing tiny stingerless wasps, which feed on

immature ticks, into tick-infested areas. Researchers are

currently assessing the effectiveness of this technique.</P>



<P>     Successful control of deer ticks will probably depend on a

combination of tactics. More studies are needed before

wide-scale tick control strategies can be implemented.</P>

<p>
<!--SECRETARY'S INTRODUCTION -->

<H4>Lamar Alexander, Secretary of Education</H4>

 <p>    As a parent of school-aged children, I share with all
Americans concern about illegal drug and alcohol use and the
threat these substances pose to the welfare of our Nation's
youths. Recent surveys give us hope that the intensive education
efforts of the last few years are paying off. The 1990 survey of
high school seniors, for example, showed that these young people
are less tolerant of drug use and more knowledgeable about the
risks of using drugs. For the first time in many years, fewer
than half of them have tried an illicit drug.   Many factors
contribute to these encouraging trends. As President Bush has
reminded us, parents have an especially vital part to play:<p>
  <blockquote>   Schools, churches, synagogues, community groups, law
enforcement--all can help us turn the tide on drug and alcohol
abuse. But none can take a parent's place. Drug education must
begin at home and in the neighborhood long before the classroom.<BR>
--Statement from the White House, February 26, 1990</blockquote>
  <p>  The standards of behavior we establish in our families
provide our children with the strongest inducements to stay off
of drugs. This handbook helps families learn about drugs,
including the drugs most children use first--alcohol and tobacco.
It gives important information on child development at four key
stages of growth and suggests activities to reinforce drug
prevention messages in the home.<p>
 <p>    <EM>Growing Up Drug Free</EM> is based on the best available
information about how children learn and what works to prevent
drug abuse. There is nothing difficult about this information,
and the only qualification needed to use it is a loving concern
for the welfare of our children and families.<p>
 <p>    Concern for the welfare of children and families underpins
every one of the national education goals that form the basis of
President Bush's <EM>AMERICA 2000</EM> education strategy. One of these
goals is that every school in America will be free of drugs and
violence and will offer a discipline environment conducive to
learning. The <EM>AMERICA 2000</EM> strategy recognizes that our schools,
our workplaces, and our communities cannot be places where
education comes first unless and until they are drug free. Our
role as parents is to do our part to help make drug-free schools
and communities a reality by the year 2000. <p>

<h3> What Parents Can Do</h3></center>

<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>

  <p>   Child rearing is one of the most important tasks anyone ever
performs, and the one for which there is the least preparation.
Most of us learn how to be parents through on-the-job training
and by following the example that our parents set.   Today the
widespread use of alcohol and other drugs subjects our children,
families, and communities to pressures unheard of 30 or 40 years
ago. Frankly, many of us need help to deal with this frightening
threat to our children's health and well-being.   Recent surveys
show that we are making progress in our national battle against
some drugs. Casual use is declining, attitudes are changing, and
we know more about what works to prevent drug use by our young
people.<p>
   <p>  As parents, we can build on that progress in our own
families by having strong, loving relationships with our
children, by teaching standards of right and wrong, by setting
and enforcing rules for behavior, by knowing the facts about
alcohol and other drugs, and by really listening to our children.<p>
<a href="#content">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<HR>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Teaching Values">Teaching Values</a></h2>
<p>
 <p>    Every family has expectations of behavior that are
determined by principles and standards. These add up to "values."
Children who decide not to use alcohol or other drugs often make
this decision because they have strong convictions against the
use of these substances-convictions that are based in a value
system. Social, family, and religious values give young people
reasons to say no and help them stick to their decisions. <p>

 <p>Here are some ways to help make your family's values clear: <p>
<ul>
<li> <STRONG>Communicate values openly.</STRONG> Talk about why values such as
honesty, self-reliance, and responsibility are important, and how
values help children make good decisions. Teach your child how
each decision builds on previous decisions as one's character is
formed, and how a good decision makes the next decision easier.
 <p>
<li> <STRONG>Recognize how your actions affect the development of your
child's values.</STRONG> Simply stated, children copy their parents'
behavior. Children whose parents smoke, for example, are more
likely to become smokers. Evaluate your own use of tobacco,
alcohol, prescription medicines, and even over-the-counter drugs.
Consider how your attitudes and actions may be shaping your
child's choice about whether or not to use alcohol or other
drugs.   This does not mean, however, that if you are in the
habit of having wine with dinner or an occasional beer or
cocktail you must stop. Children can understand and accept that
there are differences between what adults may do legally and what
is appropriate and legal for children. Keep that distinction
sharp, however. Do not let your children be involved in your
drinking by mixing a cocktail for you or bringing you a beer, and
do not allow your child to have sips of your drink.
 <p>
<li> <STRONG>Look for conflicts between your words and your actions.</STRONG>
Remember that children are quick to sense when parents send
signals by their actions that it's all right to duck unpleasant
duties or to be dishonest. Telling your child to say that you are
not at home because a phone call comes at an inconvenient time
is, in effect, teaching your child that it is all right to be
dishonest.
 <p>
<li> <STRONG>Make sure that your child understands your family values.</STRONG>
Parents assume, sometimes mistakenly, that children have
"absorbed" values even though they may be rarely or never
discussed. You can test your child's understanding by discussing
some common situations at the dinner table; for example, "What
would you do if the person ahead of you in line at the theater
dropped a dollar bill?"

<h2> <a name="SETTING AND ENFORCING">Setting and Enforcing Rules Against
the Use of Alcohol and Other Drugs</a> </h2>
<p>
<p>     As parents, we are responsible for setting rules for our
children to follow. When it comes to alcohol and other drug use,
strong rules need to be established to protect the well-being of
a child. Setting rules is only half the job, however; we must be
prepared to enforce the penalties when the rules are broken.<p>
<ul>
<li> <STRONG>Be specific.</STRONG> Explain the reasons for the rules. Tell
your child
what the rules are and what behavior is expected. Discuss the
consequences of breaking the rules: what the punishment will be,
how it will be carried out, how much time will be involved, and
what the punishment is supposed to achieve.
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Be consistent.</STRONG> Make it clear to your child that a no-
alcohol/no-drug-use rule remains the same at all times--in your
home, in a friend's home, anywhere the child is.
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Be reasonable.</STRONG> Don't add new consequences that have
not been
discussed before the rule was broken. Avoid unrealistic threats
such as, "Your father will kill you when he gets home." Instead,
react calmly and carry out the punishment that the child expects
to receive for breaking the rule.

<h2> <a name="GETTING THE FACTS">Getting the Facts</a></h2>
<p>
     As parents, we need to know about alcohol and other drugs so
that we can provide our children with current and correct
information. If we have a working knowledge of common drugs--know
their effects on the mind and body, and the symptoms of their use
we can discuss these subjects intelligently with our children. In
addition, well informed parents are better able to recognize if a
child has symptoms of alcohol or drug-related problems: At a
minimum, you should:<p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>know the different types of drugs and alcohol most commonly
used and the dangers associated with each;
<p>
<li>be able to identify paraphernalia associated with each drug; be
familiar with the street names of drugs; know what drugs look
like;
<p>
<li>know the signs of alcohol and other drug use and be alert for
changes in your child's behavior or appearance;
<p>
<li>know how to get help promptly if you suspect your child may be
using alcohol and other drugs.
<p>
</ul>
  <p>   For current information on alcohol and other drug use, the
resource section in this guide can help direct parents to
clearinghouses, drug and alcohol prevention organizations, and
parent groups--to name a few.<p>

<h2> <a name="CHILDREN AND ALCOHOL">Children and Alcohol</a></h2>
<p>
  <p>   Parents who are clear about not wanting their children to
use illicit drugs may find it harder to be tough about alcohol.
After all, alcohol is legal for adults, many parents drink, and
alcohol is a part of some religious observances. As a result, we
may view alcohol as a less dangerous substance than other drugs.
The facts say otherwise:<p>

<h2> <a name="FACTS ON TOBACCO">Facts on Tobacco</a></h2>
<p>
 <p>    We know that smokers are 10 times as likely as nonsmokers to
develop lung cancer and 3 times as likely to die at early ages
from heart attack. In fact, in 1985, smoking was the leading
cause of early death among adults. Nicotine, the active
ingredient in tobacco, is as addictive as heroin, and fewer than
20 percent of smokers are able to quit the first time they try.
Despite these facts, many children use these products.<p>
<ul>
<li> 18 percent of high school seniors are daily smokers; 11 percent
smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day.
<p>
<li> Young people who use cigarettes are also at great risk for all
other drug use.
<p>
<li> 70 percent of all children try cigarettes, 40 percent of them
before they have reached high school.
<p>
<li> Cigarettes contain more than 4,000 harmful substances, several
of which cause cancer.
<p>
<li> 12 percent of boys and 1 percent of girls have chewed tobacco
or used snuff. Smokeless tobacco is just as addictive and harmful
as tobacco that is smoked.

<h2> <a name="TALKING WITH AND LISTENING TO YOUR CHILD">Talking with and
Listening to your Child</a></h2>

<p>
  <p>   Many parents hesitate to discuss alcohol and other drug use
with their child. Some of us believe that our children couldn't
become involved with illegal substances. Others delay because we
don't know what to say or how to say it, or we are afraid of
putting ideas into our children's heads.<p>
 <p>    Don't wait until you think your child has a problem. Many
young people in treatment programs say that they had used alcohol
and other drugs for at least two years before their parents knew
about it. Begin early to talk about alcohol and other drugs, and
keep the lines of communication open.<p>
   <p>  Don't be afraid to admit that you don't have all the
answers. Let your child know that you are concerned, and that you
can work together to find answers. Some references that may help
are listed later in this text of this guide.<p>
     Here are some basic hints for improving your ability to talk
with your child about alcohol and other drugs:<p>
<ul>

<li> <STRONG>Be a good listener.</STRONG> Make sure your child feels comfortable
bringing problems or questions to you. Listen closely to what
your child says. Don't allow anger at what you hear to end the
discussion. If necessary, take a 5 minute break to calm down
before continuing. Take note of what your child is not saying,
too. If the child does not tell you about problems, take the
initiative and ask questions about what is going on at school or
in other activities.<p>
<li>   <STRONG>Be available </STRONG>to discuss even sensitive subjects.
Young people
need to know that they can rely on their parents for accurate
information about subjects that are important to them. If your
child wants to discuss something at a time when you can't give it
full attention, explain why you can't talk, set a time to talk
later, and then carry through on it!
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Give lots of praise.</STRONG> Emphasize the things your
youngster is
doing right instead of always focusing on things that are wrong.
When parents are quicker to praise than to criticize, children
learn to feel good about themselves, and they develop the self-
confidence to trust their own judgment.
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Give clear messages.</STRONG> When talking about the use of
alcohol and
other drugs, be sure you give your child a clear no-use message,
so that the child will know exactly what is expected. For
example, "In our family we don't allow the use of illegal drugs,
and children are not allowed to drink."
<p>
<li>  <STRONG>Model good behavior.</STRONG> Children learn by example as
well as
teaching. Make sure that your own actions reflect the standards
of honesty, integrity, and fair play that you expect of your
child.<p>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>COMMUNICATION TIPS</h3>
 <p>
<p>    Effective communication between parents and children is not
always easy to achieve. Children and adults have different
communication styles and different ways of responding in a
conversation. In addition, timing and atmosphere may determine
how successful communication will be. Parents should make time to
talk with their children in a quiet, unhurried manner. The
following tips are designed to make communication more
successful.<p>

<STRONG>LISTENING</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI> Pay attention.
<LI> Don't interrupt.
<LI> Don't prepare what you will say while your child is speaking.
<LI> Reserve judgment until your child has finished and has asked
you for a response.
</UL>

<STRONG>LOOKING</STRONG>
<ul>
<li> <STRONG>Be aware of your child's facial expression and body
language.</STRONG>
Is your child nervous or uncomfortable--frowning, drumming
fingers, tapping a foot, looking at the clock? Or does your child
seem relaxed--smiling, looking you in the eyes? Reading these
signs will help parents know how the child is feeling.
<p>
<li>During the conversation, <STRONG>acknowledge what your child is
saying</STRONG>-
-move your body forward if you are sitting, touch a shoulder if
you are walking, or nod your head and make eye contact.
<p>
</ul>
<STRONG>RESPONDING</STRONG>
<p>
<ul>
<li> "I am very concerned about...." or "I understand that it is
sometimes difficult ...." are better ways to respond to your
child than beginning sentences with "You should," or "If I were
you," or "When I was your age we didn't...." Speaking for oneself
sounds thoughtful and is less likely to be considered a lecture
or an automatic response. * <STRONG>If your child tells you something you
don't want to hear, don't ignore the statement.</STRONG>
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Don't offer advice in response to every statement your child
makes.</STRONG> It is better to listen carefully to what is being said and
try to understand the real feelings behind the words.
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Make sure you understand what your child means.</STRONG>
Repeat things
to your child for confirmation.
</ul>
 <p>    The preceding sections have outlined some general guidelines
for talking with children about alcohol and other drugs. We can
make these messages more effective by taking into account the
knowledge youngsters already have and their readiness to learn
new information at different ages.<p>

<p>
<h2> <a name="PRESCHOOLERS">Preschoolers</a></h2>
<p>
<p>     Drug education may seem unnecessary for preschoolers, but
the attitudes and habits learned early can have an important
bearing on the decisions children make later.<p>
  <p>   Three- and four-year-olds are not yet ready to learn complex
facts about alcohol and other drugs, but they can learn the
decision-making and problem-solving skills that they will need to
refuse alcohol and other drugs later. Remember that children in
this age group are not able to listen quietly for very long; they
are more interested in doing things for themselves.<p>
 <p>    It's tempting for busy parents to do things for young
children because it's quicker and easier. With a little planning,
however, you can use the learn-by-doing approach to teach your
preschooler how to make decisions. Let your child pick from a
range of options that are acceptable to you. When the choice is
made, make sure your child sticks with it.<p>

                   <H3>Suggested Activities</H3>
<ul>
<li><STRONG>Set aside regular times when you can give your child your full
attention.</STRONG> Playing together, reading a book, and taking a walk
are special times that help to build strong bonds of trust and
affection between you and your child.
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Point out to your child poisonous and harmful
substances</STRONG> that
can be found in your home. Household products such as bleach,
lye, and furniture polish all have warning labels that you can
read to your child. Keep all household products that could harm a
small child away from the place you store foods and out of your
child's reach.
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Explain how medicine can be harmful</STRONG> if used
incorrectly. Teach
your child not to take anything from a medicine bottle unless you
give it to the child yourself or specify someone else who can
give it, such as a babysitter or grandparent.
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Explain why children need good food</STRONG> and should put
only good
things into their bodies. Have your child name several good foods
that he or she eats regularly, and explain how those foods will
make your child strong and healthy.<p>

<li><STRONG>Provide guidelines</STRONG> that teach your child what kind of
behavior
you expect. Teach your child the basic rules of how to get along
with other children: Play fair. Share toys. Tell the truth. Treat
others the way you want them to treat you.
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Encourage your child to follow instructions.</STRONG> For example,
invite your child to help you cook; following a recipe--measuring
ingredients, cracking eggs, kneading dough--can help children
have fun while learning about step-by-step procedures. Playing
simple board games with your child can give practice in following
instructions and rules.<p>

<li> <STRONG>Take advantage of opportunities to use play</STRONG> as a way
to help
your child handle frustrating situations and solve simple
problems. A tower of blocks that continuously collapses can drive
a child to tears. You can offer a few suggestions to keep the
tower up, but at the same time you should ask your child what he
or she thinks is the best way to do it. Turning a bad situation
into a success reinforces a child's self-confidence.<p>
<p>
<li> To <STRONG>help your child learn decision making</STRONG> in a
practical way,
lay out some clothing from which the child can select what he or
she wishes to wear. Don't worry if the choices don't quite match.
Let your child know that you think he or she is able to make good
decisions.<p>

<p>
<p><h2> <a name="KINDERGARTEN-GRADE 3">Kindergarten-Grade 3</a></h2>
<p>
<p>     Five- to nine-year-olds usually feel good about themselves.
They like growing up, and they generally like school and all the
new opportunities it provides. They still think and learn
primarily by experience, and they don't have a good understanding
of things that will happen in the future. Fact and fantasy mingle
easily; the world is seen as the child wishes it to be, and not
as it actually is. Children of this age need rules to guide their
behavior and information to make good choices and decisions.<p>
 <p>    Discussions about alcohol and other drugs must be in the
here and now, and related to people and events the child knows
about. Most children are very interested in how their bodies
work, so discussions should focus on maintaining good health and
avoiding things that might harm the body.<p>
 <p>    Adults are very important both as teachers and as role
models. Children are generally trusting, and they believe that
the decisions adults make for them are right. Helping your child
know whom to trust is important. They need to understand that
just because someone tells them to do something, it is not always
right to do it.   By the end of the third grade, your child
should understand:<p>
<ul>
<li>what an illicit drug is, why it is illegal, what it looks like,
and what harm it can do:
<p>
<li>how foods, poisons, medicines, and illicit drugs differ;
<p>
<li>how medicines may help during illness, when prescribed by a
doctor and administered by a responsible adult, but also how
medicines are drugs that can be harmful if misused:
<p>
<li>why it is important to avoid unknown and possibly dangerous
objects, containers, and substances;
<p>
<li>which adults, both at school and outside, you want your child
to rely on for answers to questions or help in an emergency;
<p>
<li>which foods are nutritious and why exercise is important;
<p>
<li>what the school and home rules are about alcohol and other drug
use; and
<p>
<li>how using alcohol and other drugs is illegal for all children.
</ul><p>
                      <H3>Suggested Activities</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Children in this age group need to understand the family's
rules. You can explain the need for rules by talking about
traffic safety rules and school rules with which your child is
already familiar.
<p>
<li> Emphasize the importance of good health by talking about things
people do to stay healthy, such as brushing teeth after each
meal, washing hands, eating good foods, getting plenty of rest
and sleep. You can use this discussion to contrast the harmful
things that people do, such as taking drugs, smoking, or drinking
to excess.
<p>
<li> Discuss how TV advertisers try to persuade children to buy
their products, including high sugar/additives-loaded cereals,
candy bars, and toys named after characters in cartoon shows that
children find appealing.
<p>
<li>Discuss illnesses with which your child is familiar and for
which prescription drugs are often necessary. Many children have
had strep throat, ear infections, flu, and colds. Discussing such
illnesses can help your child understand the difference between
medicine and illicit drugs.
<p>
<li>Practice ways to say no with your child. Describe situations
that may make your child feel uncomfortable: being invited to
ride a bike where you do not allow your child to go, for example,
or being offered medicine or other unfamiliar substances. Give
your child some responses to use in these situations.
<p>
<li> Develop a "helpers" file of people your child can rely on. Put
together a phone list of relatives, family friends, neighbors,
teachers, religious leaders, and the police and fire departments.
Illustrate the list with photos. Talk with your child about the
kind of help each person on the list could provide in case of
various unexpected situations, such as being approached by
strangers or losing a house key.<p>

<h2> <a name="GRADES 4-6">Grades 4-6</a></h2>
<p>
  <p>   This is a period of slowed physical growth when typically a
lot of energy goes into learning. Children 10 to 12 years old
love to learn facts, especially strange ones, and they want to
know how things work and what sources of information are
available to them.   Friends--a single best friend or a group of
friends--become very important. What children this age are
interested in or will be committed to often is determined by what
the group thinks. Children's self-image is determined in part by
the extent to which they are accepted by peers, especially
popular peers. As a result, a lot of "followers" are unable to
make independent decisions and choices.<p>
   <p>  This age is perhaps the most important time for parents to
focus on increased efforts at drug prevention. These late
elementary school years are crucial to decisions about the use of
alcohol and other drugs. The greatest risk for starting to smoke
comes in the sixth and seventh grades. Research shows that the
earlier youngsters begin to use alcohol and other drugs, the more
likely they are to have real trouble.<p>
 <p>    Your child will need a clear no-use message, factual
information, and strong motivation to resist pressures to try
alcohol and other drugs and to reinforce the determination to
remain drug free. Appropriate new information could include:<p>
<ul>
<li>ways to identify specific drugs, including alcohol, tobacco,
marijuana, inhalants, and cocaine in their various forms;
<p>
<li>the long- and short-term effects and consequences of use;
<p>
<li>the effects of drugs on different parts of the body, and the
reasons why drugs are especially dangerous for growing bodies;
and
<p>
<li>the consequences of alcohol and other illegal drug use to the
family, society, and the user.<p>
</ul><p>

                      <H3>Suggested Activities</H3>
<ul>
<li> Create special times when you are available to talk to your
child. Try to give your child undivided attention. A walk
together, dinner in a quiet place, or a visit to the ice cream
parlor after a movie are some ways to make talking together a
little easier.<p>

<li> Encourage your child to participate in wholesome activities
that will allow the child to form new friendships and have fun.
Sports, Scouts, religious-sponsored youth programs, and
community-sponsored youth organizations are excellent ways for
children to meet others of their own age.<p>

<li> Teach your child to be aware of how drugs and alcohol are
promoted. Discuss how children are bombarded with messages--from
TV, song lyrics, billboards, and advertisements--that using
alcohol and other drugs is very glamorous. Clearly separate the
myths from the realities of alcohol and other drug use.<p>

<li> Continue to practice ways to say no with your child,
emphasizing ways to refuse alcohol and other drugs. It is not
uncommon for sixth graders to be offered beer and cigarettes and
to know other children who smoke and drink alcohol.<p>

<li> Encourage your child to join a local anti-drug club or peer
assistance group that encourages drug-free activities.
<p>
<li> Ask your child to scan the morning newspaper and to circle any
article that has to do with alcohol and other drug use. No doubt
there will be articles about drug-related murders, strife in
other countries due to drug trafficking, and alcohol-related auto
accidents. Talk with your child about the tremendous loss of
lives and resources because of the use of alcohol and other
drugs.<p>

<li> Make friends with the parents of your child's friends so that
you can reinforce one another's efforts in teaching good personal
and social habits. A neighborhood social gathering, sporting
event, or school assembly are good places to meet. * Join with
other parents in providing supervised activities for young people
to limit "free time," which often leads to experimentation with
alcohol and other drugs.<p>

<p><h2> <a name="GRADES 7-9">Grades 7-9</a></h2>

<p>     During the early teens "fitting in" with friends is a
controlling influence. In some ways, the onset of puberty is like
a "rebirth." Children want and need to let go of the past and to
find their own unique identity. This often means letting go of
old friendships and ties with teachers and other adults, as well
as old ways of doing things. The decision-making and problem-
solving methods that they learned as young children are still
helpful, but young teens will be making new decisions based on
new information and new goals.<p>
 <p>    Young people this age can begin to deal with abstractions
and the future. They understand that their actions have
consequences, and they know how their behavior affects others.
They sometimes have a shaky self-image: they are not sure whether
they are growing and changing adequately, they are often in
conflict with adults, they are not sure where they are headed,
and they tend to see themselves as not "okay." Strong emotional
support and a good model of adult behavior are particularly
important now.<p>
 <p>    Young people who use alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs
typically begin before leaving the ninth grade. Be sure that
family discussions about drugs emphasize the immediate,
unpleasant effects of alcohol and other drug use. Telling junior
high school students who are smoking that they will get lung
cancer or heart disease in several decades is less likely to make
an impression than talking about bad breath, stained teeth and
fingers, and burned clothing.<p>
<p>  Many young people use drugs because their friends use drugs. A
large portion of your prevention efforts during these years
should be spent reinforcing your child's motivation to avoid
alcohol and other drugs. Here are some important steps:<p>
<ol>
<li>Counteract peer influence with parent influence. Reinforce your
no-alcohol/no-drug-use rules and expectations so that your child
clearly understands that drinking and using drugs are
unacceptable and illegal. Children may argue that "everyone is
doing it" and not experiencing any harmful effects. Inform your
child that alcohol and other drug use is illegal for children and
that "everyone is not doing it." Emphasize how unpredictable the
effects of alcohol and other drugs can be, so that although many
drug users may appear to function properly, drug use is extremely
risky, and all it takes is one bad experience to change a life.
<p>
<li> Get to know your child's friends and their parents. Meet your
child's friends. Invite them to your home frequently. Share your
expectations about behavior with other parents. Work together to
develop a set of rules about curfews, unchaperoned parties, and
other social activities.<p>

<li> Monitor your child's whereabouts. If your child is at "a
friend's house," be sure that you know the friend and the
parents. If your child is at the movies, be sure you know what
film is playing and at which theater. Last-minute changes in
plans, such as visiting a different friend or going to a
different movie, should not be permitted unless the child checks
with Mom, Dad, or another designated adult.<p>
</ol>
   <p>  By the end of ninth grade your child should know:<p>
<ul>
<li>the characteristics and chemical nature of specific drugs and
drug interactions;
<p>
<li>the physiology of drug effects on the circulatory, respiratory,
nervous, and reproductive systems;
<p>
<li>the stages of chemical dependency and their unpredictability
from person to person;
<p>
<li>the ways that drug use affects activities requiring motor
coordination, such as driving a car or participating in sports;
and
<p>
<li>family history, particularly if alcoholism or other drug
addiction has been a problem.
<p>
</ul>
                     <H3> Suggested Activities</H3>
<ul>
<li> Continue to practice ways to say no with your child. Teach your
child to recognize problem situations, such as being at a house
where no adults are present and young people are smoking or
drinking beer. Make up situations in which your child may be
asked to try alcohol and other drugs and let the child practice
saying no using the steps outlined. Try many variations until you
are confident that your child knows how to say no.
<p>
<li> Children this age are very concerned about how others see them.
You can help your child develop a positive self-image by making
sure that the child looks good and feels healthy. In addition to
providing well-balanced meals, keep your refrigerator and pantry
stocked with appealing alternatives to junk food.
<p>
<li>Continue to spend private time with your child to discuss what
your child feels is important in his or her life right now. Your
child's fears about emerging sexuality, appearing different from
friends, and going on to high school are real problems and
deserve your concern and attention.
<p>
<li>Periodically review and update, with your child's
participation, your house rules and your child's responsibilities
regarding chores, homework, time limit on TV watching, and the
curfew on school and weekend nights. Discuss these questions with
your child: Are the rules fair and the consequences appropriate?
Is it time to switch to some new chores? Should there be fewer or
different chores because of added homework assignments or after-
school activities? Should the curfew be adjusted?
<p>
<li> Talk with your child about friendship. Make the point that true
friends do not ask each other to do things they know are wrong
and risk harm to themselves, their friends, or their families.
<p>
<li> Plan supervised parties or other activities for your child in
your home which reflect a no alcohol/no-drug-use rule. For
example, have your child invite friends to share a pizza and
watch TV.

<p><h2> <a name="GRADES 10-12">Grades 10-12</a></h2>

  <p>  High school students are future-oriented and can engage in
abstract thinking. They have an increasingly realistic
understanding of adults. Young people therefore want adults to
discuss their concerns and the ways they solve problems and make
decisions. You may have a tremendous new opportunity to help your
children at this age. At the same time, the teenagers continue to
be group-orientated, and belonging to the group motivates much of
their behavior and actions. During these years, young people
often develop a broader outlook and become more interested in the
welfare of others.<p>
  <p>   By the end of high school, your child should understand:<p>
<ul>
<li>both the immediate and long-term physical effects of specific
drugs;
<p>
<li>the possibly fatal effects of combining drugs;
<p>
<li>the relationship of drug use to other diseases and
disabilities;
<p>
<li>the effects of alcohol and other drugs on the fetus during
pregnancy;
<p>
<li>the fact that drug use is not a victimless crime;

<p>     You may want to focus on the potential long-term effects of
alcohol and other drugs during these years: drugs can ruin your
teen's chances of getting into college, being accepted by the
military, or being hired for certain jobs. Your teen may also be
impressed by the importance of being seen as a good role model
for a younger brother or sister.<p>
<p>     Although young people long for independence it is
particularly important to keep them involved in the family and
family activities. They should join the rest of the family for
dinner regularly, be part of family vacations, and remain part of
family routines.<p>

<H3>                      Suggested Activities</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to talk with your teenager about alcohol and other
drug use. Chances are your teen has friends who use alcohol and
other drugs or knows people who do. Talk about how alcohol and
other drug use threatens lives and may limit opportunities for
the future.
<p>
<li> Plan strategies to limit your teen's unsupervised hours at
home, while you are at work. Researchers have found that
lunchtime and 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. are periods teenagers are likely
to experiment with alcohol and other drugs.
<p>
<li> Encourage your teenager to work on behalf of a drug prevention
program by being trained as a volunteer to answer hot-line calls
or as a peer counselor.
<p>
<li> Talk with your teenager about joining a sports club, drama
club, arts and crafts center, or dance studio or about
volunteering to work for a church group or community
organization. The busier your teenager is, the less likely he or
she is to be bored and to seek an outlet in alcohol or other
drugs. Volunteer with your teenager, if you have time.
<p>
<li> Plan alcohol- and drug-free activities with other families
during school vacations and major holidays, which can be high-
risk idle times for teens.
<p>
<li>Make sure your teen has access to up-to-date information on
alcohol and other drugs and their effects. Make an effort to be
informed about any new drugs that are popular, and know their
effects. (For suggested reading, see the resources section at the
end of this booklet.)
<p>
<li>Cooperate with other parents to make sure that the parties and
social events your teenager attends are alcohol- and drug-free.
Some families choose to draw up a contract holding adults
responsible for parties given in their homes; the contract
specifies that all parties will be supervised and that there is
to be no use of alcohol or other drugs. (See "Safe Homes" in the
resource section.)
<p>
<li>Help plan community-sponsored drug-free activities such as
alcohol- and drug-free dances and other recreational activities
such as "midnight basketball."
<p>
<li>Talk with your teenager about the future. Discuss your
expectations and your teenager's ambitions. Collect college or
vocational catalogs for your teenager, and discuss different
educational and career options. Plan a family outing to local
colleges and universities.<p>
</ul>
  <p>   Young people use drugs for many reasons that have to do with
how they feel about themselves, how they get along with others,
and how they live. No one factor determines who will use drugs
and who will not, but here are some predictors:<p>
<ul>
<li> low grades or poor school performance;
<li> aggressive, rebellious behavior;
<li>excessive influence by peers;
<li> lack of parental support and guidance; and
<li> behavior problems at an early age.
</ul>
   <p>  Being alert to the signs of alcohol and other drug use
requires a keen eye. It is sometimes hard to know the difference
between normal teenage behavior and behavior caused by drugs.
Changes that are extreme or that last for more than a few days
may signal drug use.   Consider the following questions:<p>

<ul>
<li> Does your child seem withdrawn, depressed, tired, and careless
about personal grooming?
<p>
<li> Has your child become hostile and uncooperative?
<p>
<li>Have your child's relationships with other family members
deteriorated?
<p>
<li>Has your child dropped his old friends?
<p>
<li>Is your child no longer doing well in school-- grades slipping,
attendance irregular?
<p>
<li> Has your child lost interest in hobbies, sports, and other
favorite activities?
<p>
<li> Have your child's eating or sleeping patterns changed?
</ul>
 <p>    Positive answers to any of these questions can indicate
alcohol or other drug use. However, these signs may also apply to
a child who is not using drugs but who may be having other
problems at school or in the family. If you are in doubt, get
help. Have your family doctor or local clinic examine your child
to rule out illness or other physical problems.<p>
   <p>  Watch for signs of drugs and drug paraphernalia as well.
Possession of common items such as pipes, rolling papers, small
medicine bottles, eye drops, or butane lighters may signal that
your child is using drugs.<p>
  <p>   Even when the signs are clearer, usually after the child has
been using drugs for a time, parents sometimes do not want to
admit that their child could have a problem. Anger, resentment,
guilt, and a sense of failure as parents are common reactions.<p>
 <p>    If your child is using drugs, it is important to avoid
blaming yourself for the problem and to get whatever help is
needed to stop it. The earlier a drug problem is detected and
faced, the more likely it is that your child can be helped.<p>
   <p>  First, do not confront a child who is under the influence of
alcohol or other drugs, but wait until the child is sober. Then
discuss your suspicions with your child calmly and objectively.
Bring in other members of the family to help, if necessary.<p>
   <p>  Second, impose whatever discipline your family has decided
on for violating the rules and stick to it. Don't relent because
the youngster promises never to do it again.<p>
 <p>    Many young people lie about their alcohol and drug use. If
you think your child is not being truthful and the evidence is
pretty strong, you may wish to have your child evaluated by a
health professional experienced in diagnosing adolescents with
alcohol- and drug-related problems.<p>
   <p>  If your child has developed a pattern of drug use or has
engaged in heavy use, you will probably need help to intervene.
If you do not know about drug treatment programs in your area,
call your doctor, local hospital, or county mental health society
for a referral. Your school district should have a substance
abuse coordinator or a counselor who can refer you to treatment
programs, too. Parents whose children have been through treatment
programs can also provide information.<p>
   <p>  The most promising drug prevention programs are those in
which parents, students, schools, and communities join together
to send a firm, clear message that the use of alcohol and other
drugs will not be tolerated.<p>

<HR>
<p><h2> <a name="SCHOOL-PARENT COOPERATION">School-Parent Cooperation</a></h2>
 <p>    The development of strong policies that spell out rules
governing use, possession, and sale of alcohol and other drugs is
a key part of any school-based prevention program. Learn what
your school's policies are and actively support them. If your
school has no policy, work with teachers, administrators, and
community members to develop one. Good school policies typically
specify what constitutes an alcohol or other drug offense, spell
out the consequences for violating the policy, describe
procedures for handling violations, and build community support
for the policy.<p>
 <p>    Visit your child's school and learn how drug education is
being taught. Are the faculty members trained to teach about
alcohol and other drug use? Is drug education a regular part of
the curriculum or limited to a special week? Is it taught through
the health class, or do all teachers incorporate drug education
into their subject area? Do children in every grade receive drug
education, or is it limited to selected grades? Is there a
component for parents?<p>
   <p>  If your school has an active program to prevent drug use,
ask to see the materials that are being used. Do they contain a
clear message that alcohol and other drug use is wrong and
harmful? Is the information accurate and up-to-date? Does the
school have referral sources for students who need special help?
 <p>    Let other parents know about the school's policies through
meetings of the parent-teacher organization. At least one meeting
each year should be devoted to issues of alcohol and other drug
use. Knowledgeable local physicians and pharmacists can be
invited to discuss how drugs affect the growth and development of
children, police officers can outline the scope and severity of
the drug problem in your community, and substance abuse
counselors can discuss symptoms of alcohol and other drug use and
treatment options.<p>

<p><h2> <a name="PARENT-COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES">Parent-Community
Activities</a></h2>
  <p>   Help your child to grow up alcohol and drug free by
supporting community efforts to give young people healthy
alternatives. Alcohol- and drug-free proms and other school-based
celebrations are growing in popularity around the country. You
can help to organize such events, solicit contributions, and
serve as a chaperon.<p>
  <p>   Local businesses are also an excellent source of support for
alternative activities such as athletic teams and part-time jobs.
Shops and restaurants in one community in Texas, for example, now
offer discounts to young people who test negative for drugs in a
voluntary urinalysis.<p>
<a href="#content">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<HR>
<p><h2> <a name="PARENT SUPPORT GROUPS">Parent Support Groups</a></h2>

 <p>    Other parents can be valuable allies in your effort to keep
your child drug free. Get to know the parents of your child's
friends. Share expectations about behavior and develop a set of
mutually agreed upon rules about such things as curfews,
unchaperoned parties, and places that are off-limits. Helping
youngsters stay out of trouble is easier when rules of conduct
are clearly known and widely shared.<p>
 <p>    Build a network of other adults with whom you can talk. Join
a parent organization in your community, or talk informally with
your friends about common concerns in rearing children. Sharing
experiences can provide insights that help you deal with your
child's behavior. It also helps to know that other parents have
faced similar situations.<p>
 <p>    Despite the grim stories that fill our newspapers and
dominate the evening news, most young people do not use illicit
drugs, they do not approve of drug use by their friends, and they
share their parents' concern about the dangers posed by drugs.
Successful prevention efforts, whether in a family, school, or
community setting, have many elements in common: a concern for
the welfare and well being of young people, dedicated adults who
are willing to devote their time and energy, and an unwavering
commitment to being drug free.<p>
  <p>   That commitment led a small group of parents in Bowling
Green, Kentucky, to form Bowling Green Parents for Drug-Free
Youth. The organization has worked closely with the local schools
and community to provide training and education for all members
of the community, and it has raised more than $35,000 to help
finance its efforts. Questionnaires administered to students in
grades 7-12 for 6 consecutive years have shown a steady decline
in the use of alcohol and other drugs.<p>
   <p>  Gail Amato, president of the Bowling Green Parents for Drug-
Free Youth, speaks persuasively about why parents must be
involved in helping to prevent alcohol and other drug use:<p>
  <blockquote>   People often ask me why I think parents are the answer, and
I think it's because we have the most to lose. Schools can help,
churches can help, law enforcement can help, but no one can
replace the family. Being involved with drug and alcohol
prevention lets our children know that we care. It strengthens
the family and helps us to be the kind of parents our children
need us to be.</blockquote>
<p>     A similar commitment leads parents of students in Commodore
Stockton Skills School in Stockton, California, to donate more
than 400 volunteer hours each month helping in the classrooms.
Last year a family picnic held during Red Ribbon Week, a national
drug awareness week, drew 500 participants for a day of games and
activities focused on prevention of drug use.<p>
   <p>  In addition to helping in the classroom, Stockton parents
work to maintain discipline, to reinforce students' respect for
other people, and to foster personal responsibility at home.<p>
 <p>    As a result, behavioral problems in the school are
infrequent, attendance is high, and area police report juvenile
drug arrests from every school in the city except Commodore
Stockton.<p>
 <p>    Successful efforts to rid a neighborhood of drugs are often
joint efforts. Two years ago in New Haven, Connecticut, the
residents of six housing projects joined forces to solve a
neighborhood problem--drugs. The residents were afraid for the
safety of their children and sick of the murders and other
nightly violence related to drug deals.<p>
 <p>    Representing more than 1,400 families from the six projects,
the group drafted an action plan to rid the neighborhood of
drugs. The residents asked the local police to conduct "sting"
operations periodically. Members of the New Haven news media have
been invited to the project, where residents speak openly about
the problems they encounter. The residents have invited local
community groups and the Greater New Haven Labor Council to join
in the fight. In addition, the mayor has become directly involved
in their struggle.<p>
   <p>  One member, speaking on behalf of the residents, stated its
main objective: "We are banding together to stop this madness so
that we can have a peaceful and livable neighborhood and
community." Today, drug sales have decreased, and members of the
community feel safer and more hopeful about the future.<p>

<P>
WASHINGTON, Feb. 29 -- U.S. food manufacturers
will add the nutrient folic acid to most enriched breads, flours, corn meals,
pastas, rice and other grain products to reduce the risk of neural tube birth
defects in newborns, as a result of action taken today by the Department of
Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
<P>
Folic acid, or folate, reduces the risk of neural tube birth defects such as
spina bifida when consumed in adequate amounts by women before and during early
pregnancy.  Spina bifida is a common disabling birth condition resulting from
failure of the spinal column to close.</P>
<P>
"This is an important step in helping to prevent some of the most significant
birth defects affecting Americans," said HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala.  "It is
a balanced approach, based on our best scientific understanding to date
regarding the role of folic acid in our diet.  And it reflects hard work by all
the Public Health Service agencies to protect our childrens' futures."</P>
<P>
The Public Health Service recommended in 1992 that all women of child-bearing
age consume 0.4 milligrams of folic acid daily to reduce their risk of giving
birth to children with neural tube defects.  As part of the Public Health
Service strategy to achieve that goal, the FDA fortification rule is aimed at
increasing folate intakes.</P>
<P>
"Women of child-bearing age should eat a diet rich in leafy dark green
vegetables, citrus fruits and juices, and lentils, or take a multivitamin a day
to assure adequate levels of folic acid," said Dr. David A. Kessler,
Commissioner of Food and Drugs.  "In addition, by fortifying grain products, we
are making it easier for women of child-bearing age to achieve adequate folic
acid levels in their diets." Under the new FDA rules, specified grain products
will be required to be fortified with folic acid at levels ranging from 0.43
milligrams to 1.4 mg per pound of product.  These amounts are designed to keep
daily intake of folic acid below 1 mg, because intakes above that amount may
mask symptoms of pernicious anemia, a form of vitamin B12 deficiency which
primarily affects older people.  If untreated, pernicious anemia can lead to
severe permanent nerve damage.</P>
<P>
Because over half of all pregnancies are unplanned and because these defects
occur in the developing fetus before most women know they are pregnant, it is
important that all women of child-bearing age consume the needed 400 micrograms
(.4 mg) of folic acid daily.  In addition to fortified grain products, PHS
recommended that women should obtain this amount through food sources and/or a
dietary supplement (such as a multivitamin), or a combination of these sources.</P>
<P>
According to David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D, Director, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), "CDC estimates that there are approximately 4,000
pregnancies each year, including 2,500 live births, that are affected by spina
bifida and other neural tube birth defects. We are pleased that the action taken
today by FDA to fortify grain products with folic acid will help prevent many
cases of these serious birth defects affecting the spine and brain."</P>
<P>
Foods required to be fortified are enriched bread, rolls, and buns; all enriched
flour including bromated and self-rising flours; enriched corn grits and corn
meals; enriched farina and rice, and all enriched macaroni and noodle products
including vegetable macaroni, vegetable noodle, and non-fat milk macaroni
products.  In addition, breakfast cereals can add folic acid up to 400 mcg per
serving.</P>
<P>
Also under the new rules, manufacturers will be allowed to make claims on the
labels that the fortified products contain folate or folic acid and that
adequate intake of the nutrient has been shown to reduce the risk of neural tube
birth defects.</P>
<P>
FDA will review any new data concerning optimum fortification levels for folic
acid and will consider adjusting the level of fortification if the data
substantiate the need.</P>
<P>
These final rules on fortification will be published in the Federal Register and
will become effective Jan. 1, 1998.</P>

<P>
LANCASTER, Pa., March 5 -- One in 20 American
children has a serious eye disorder.  Without early intervention and treatment,
those children -- approximately 1.2 million kids -- will suffer permanent vision
damage.  Earlier vision testing enables treatment when it is still effective. 
Unfortunately, current testing methods pediatricians and other primary care
doctors use for preverbal children (age 3 and under) will often miss serious eye
problems.</P>
<P>
Most American children get their first full vision examination when they start
school and are old enough to read an eye chart.  Sadly, that is usually too late
for effective treatment of serious eye disorders such as amblyopia ("lazy eye").
 The best age to detect and treat such conditions is between one and three
years.  The sooner a problem is detected, the easier it is to treat -- or even
cure.</P>
<P>
Refractive errors, astigmatism, cataracts and strabismus can lead to amblyopia,
which is a loss of vision caused by uneven strength of the eyes.  Amblyopia is
treatable if caught early.  Treatment involves wearing glasses, patching the
eye, eye drops, or surgery.  Children who receive early treatment often go on to
enjoy a lifetime of good vision. However, if treatment is not started early,
vision damage is permanent and can even lead to blindness.  In fact, amblyopia
is the leading cause of monocular blindness today.</P>
<P>
It is an insidious condition.  In a recent article on amblyopia, Dr. James D.
Reynolds of the University of Arkansas School of Medicine writes, "Amblyopia is
a very common, serious disease of childhood that often has no signs or symptoms.
 Without early and proper treatment, it can produce a lifetime visual
disability."</P>
<P>
But a revolutionary new camera, the MTI PhotoScreener, can effectively screen
preverbal children for eye problems.  This camera, which works on children as
young as six months, takes special Polaroid photographs that show if a youngster
has a vision disorder.  The PhotoScreener test takes less than two minutes,
produces instant results, doesn't require messy eye drops or restraints and is
painless. That means that pediatricians, family physicians, eye care
professionals and health screening organizations can easily add it to their
routine testing procedures for young children.</P>
<P>
The MTI PhotoScreener takes a special photograph of a child's eyes that detect
vision problems.  Any potential disorder shows up as a crescent on the
photograph.  The PhotoScreener does not take the place of a full ophthalmic
exam; if a problem is detected, the child should receive further testing from an
eye care professional.</P>
<P>
Comprehensive research conducted by the University of Iowa proves the MTI
PhotoScreener works.  Dr. Bill Scott, author of the study, has said, "The MTI
PhotoScreener is an accurate and reliable device designed to detect amblyogenic
factors in young children.  The camera offers promise as a mass-screening
tool."</P>
<P>
Developed by a pediatric surgeon and an ophthalmologist, the MTI PhotoScreener
is now being distributed around the world.  Primary care doctors, eye care
specialists, hospitals and health screening groups are using this new FDA
cleared camera to check for vision problems in preverbal children.</P>
<P>
The product is manufactured by Medical Technology and Innovations, Inc., a
publicly traded firm based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  For more information,

<H3><a name="Foreword">Foreword</a> </H3>

<P>Remember thumbing through an atlas or encyclopedia as a child,
imagining yourself as a world traveler on a safari in Africa, or
boating up the Mississippi River, climbing the peaks of the
Himalayas, visiting ancient cathedrals and castles of Europe, the
Great Wall of China? We do. The world seemed full of faraway,
exotic, and wonderful places that we wanted to know more about. </P>

<P>Today, we would like to believe that youngsters are growing up
similarly inquisitive about the world. Perhaps they are, but recent
studies and reports indicate that, if such imaginings are stirring
in our youngsters, they're not being translated into knowledge.
Not that there ever was a "golden age" when all our young and all
our citizens were conversant about the peoples and places of the
globe. Still, there is considerable evidence that such knowledge
among young Americans has dipped to an alarming low.</P>

<P>Last year, a nine-nation survey found that one in five young
Americans (18- to 24-year-olds) could not locate the United States
on an outline map of the world. Young Americans knew measurably
less geography than Americans 25 years of age and over. Only in the
United States did 18- to 24-year-olds know less than people 55
years old and over; in all eight other nations, young adults knew
more than the older ones. </P>

<P>No less disturbing was the fact that our young adults, when
compared with young adults in other countries, came in last place
in a 1980 Gallup Poll. Our 18- to 24-year-olds knew less about
geography than their age-mates in every other participating nation.
But it shouldn't surprise us. Youngsters in other countries study
more geography. In England, Canada, and the Soviet Union, geography
is considered one of the basic academic subjects and is required
of most secondary students; in the United States, only one in seven
students takes a high school geography course. </P>

<P>You'd think that our students learn at least some geography,
though, in their world history classes. Those who take world
history probably do. But that's only 44 percent of our high school
graduates. More than half of our high school students are
graduating without studying world history. </P>

<P>If youngsters are to acquire an appreciation of geography and
ultimately learn to think geographically, parents and communities
must insist that local schools restore it to prominence in the
curriculum. They should insist that geography be studied and
learned, in one form or another, through several years of the
primary and secondary curriculum. </P>

<P>Learning should not be restricted to the classroom. Parents are a
child's first teachers and can do much to advance a youngster's
geographic knowledge. This booklet suggests some ways to do so. </P>

<P>It is based on a fundamental assumption: that children generally
learn what adults around them value. The significance attached to
geography at home or at school can be estimated in a glance at the
walls and bookshelves. </P>

<P>Simply put, youngsters who grow up around maps and atlases are more
likely to get the "map habit" than youngsters who do not. Where
there are maps, atlases, and globes, discussions of world events
(at whatever intellectual level) are more likely to include at
least a passing glance at their physical location. Turning to maps
and atlases frequently leads youngsters to fashion, over time,
their own "mental maps" of the world--maps that serve not only to
organize in their minds the peoples, places, and things they see
and hear about in the news, but also to suggest why certain events
unfold in particular places. </P>

<P>Helping every child develop his or her ability to use maps and to
develop mental maps of the world ought to become a priority in our
homes and schools. For, as we all know, our lives are becoming an
ever tighter weave of interactions with people around the world.
If our businesses are to fare well in tomorrow's world markets, if
our national policies are to achieve our aims in the future, and
if our relationships with other peoples are to grow resilient and
mutually enriching, our children must grow to know what in the
world is where. </P>

<P>This booklet is designed to help parents stir children's curiosity
and steer that curiosity toward geographic questions and knowledge.
It is organized around the five themes recently set forth by
geographers and geography educators across the Nation--the physical
location of a place, the character of a place, relationships
between places, movement of people and things, and phenomena that
cause us to group places into particular regions. </P>

<P>We encourage parents to get to the fun part--that is, the
activities. The games, maps, and suggested activities that follow,
while informal and easy to do, can help lay a solid foundation in
experience for children's later, more academic forays into
geography. </P>

<P>Children are playing in the sand. They make roads for cars. One 
builds a castle where a doll can live. Another scoops out a hole,
uses the dirt to make a hill, and pours some water in the hole to
make a lake. Sticks become bridges and trees. The children name the
streets, and may even use a watering can to make rain. </P>
 
<P>Although they don't know it, these children are learning the 
principles of geography. They are locating things, seeing how 
people interact with the Earth, manipulating the environment, 
learning how weather changes the character of a place, and looking
at how places relate to each other through the movement of things
from one place to another.  </P>
 
<P>With this book, we hope you, as parents, will get ideas for 
activities that will use your children's play to informally help
them learn more geography--the study of the Earth. </P>
 
<P>Most of the suggestions in this book are geared to children under
10 years of age. The activities and games are organized around five
specific themes that help focus our thinking. These themes were 
developed by the Joint Committee on Geographic Education of the 
National Council for Geographic Education and the American 
Association of Geographers and are now being used in many schools.
They are: </P>
 
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> Where are things located? 
 
	<LI> What makes a place special? 
 
	<LI> What are the relationships among people and places? 
 
	<LI> What are the patterns of movement of people, products, and   
   	information? 
 
	<LI> How can the Earth be divided into regions for study? 
</OL>
    
<P>These themes have been adopted by many schools in the last few   
years and may be new to many parents. To help focus your       
awareness of the issues, we will begin each chapter with a brief
description of the theme. This description includes examples of  
questions geographers use as they strive to understand and define
the Earth, for geography provides us with a system for asking 
questions about the Earth. </P>

<H4><a name="Location">Location: Position On the Earth's Surface</a></H4> 
 
<P>Look at a map. Where are places located?  To determine location,
geographers use a set of imaginary lines that crisscross the 
surface of the globe. Lines designating "latitude" tell us how 
far north or south of the equator a place is. Lines designating 
"longitude" measure distance east and west of the prime meridian-
-an imaginary line running between the North Pole and the South 
Pole through Greenwich, England. You can use latitude and 
longitude as you would a simple grid system on a state highway 
map. The point where the lines intersect is the "location"--or 
global address. For example, St. Louis, Missouri, is roughly at 
39 degrees north latitude and 90 degrees west longitude.  </P>
 
<P>Why are things located in particular places and how do those 
places influence our lives? Location further describes how one 
place relates to another. St. Louis is on the Mississippi River 
midway between Minneapolis-St. Paul and New Orleans where the 
Mississippi and the Missouri rivers meet. It developed as a 
trading center between east and west, north and south. </P>
 <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
 <HR>
<H4><a name="Directions">Directions </a></H4>
 
<P>To help young children learn location, make sure they know the 
color and style of the building in which they live, the name of 
their town, and their street address. Then, when you talk about 
other places, they have something of their own with which to 
compare.  </P>
 
<ul>
<li>    Children need to understand positional words. Teach children
     words like "above" and "below" in a natural way when you talk
     with them or give them directions. When picking up toys to put
     away, say, "Please put your toy into the basket on the right"
     or, "Put the green washcloth into the drawer." Right and left
     are as much directional terms as north, south, east, and west.
     Other words that describe such features as color, size, and
     shape are also important. 
<br><br>

<li>    Show your children north, south, east, and west by using your
     home as a reference point. Perhaps you can see the sun rising
     in the morning through a bedroom window that faces east and
     setting at night through the westerly kitchen window.  
<br><br> 

<li>    Reinforce their knowledge by playing games. Once children have
     their directional bearings, you can hide an object, for
     example, then give them directions to its location: "two steps
     to the north, three steps west. . . ." 
<br><br> 

<li>    Use pictures from books and magazines to help your children
     associate words with visual images. A picture of a desert can
     stimulate conversation about the features of a desert--arid
     and barren. Work with your children to develop more complex
     descriptions of different natural and cultural features.

<H4><a name="Maps">Maps</a> </H4>
 
<P>Put your child's natural curiosity to work. Even small children can
learn to read simple maps of their school, neighborhood, and
community. Here are some simple map activities you can do with your
children. </P>
 
<ul>
<li>    Go on a walk and collect natural materials such as acorns and
     leaves to use for an art project. Map the location where you
     found those items.  
<br><br>
 
<li>    Create a treasure map for children to find hidden treats in
     the back yard or inside your home. Treasure maps work
     especially well for birthday parties. 
<br><br>
 
<li>    Look for your city or town on a map. If you live in a large
     city or town, you may even be able to find your street. Point
     out where your relatives or your children's best friends live. 
<br><br>
      
<li>    Find the nearest park, lake, mountain, or other cultural or
     physical feature on a map. Then, talk about how these features
     affect your child's life. Living near the ocean may make your
     climate moderate, prairies may provide an open path for high
     winds, and mountains may block some weather fronts. 
<br><br>
  
<li>    By looking at a map, your children may learn why they go to
     a particular school. Perhaps the next nearest school is on the
     other side of a park, a busy street, or a large hill.  Maps
     teach us about our surroundings by portraying them in relation
     to other places. 
<br><br>
  
<li>    Before taking a trip, show your children a map of where you
     are going and how you plan to get there. Look for other ways
     you could go, and talk about why you decided to use a
     particular route. Maybe they can suggest other routes. 
<br><br>
  
<li>    Encourage your children to make their own maps using legends
     with symbols. Older children can draw a layout of their
     street, or they can illustrate places or journeys they have
     read about. Some books, like Winnie-the-Pooh and The Wizard
     of Oz, contain fanciful maps. These can be models for children
     to create and plot their own stories. 
<br><br>
  
<li>    Keep a globe and a map of the United States near the
     television and use them to locate places talked about on
     television programs, or to follow the travels of your favorite 
     sports team.

<H4><a name="Additional">Additional Activities</a></H4> 
 
<P>Children use all of their senses to learn about the world. 
Objects that they can touch, see, smell, taste, and hear help 
them understand the link between a model and the real thing.  </P>

<ul>
<li>    Put together puzzles of the United States or the world.
     Through the placement of the puzzle pieces, children gain a
     tactile and visual sense of where one place is located in
     relation to others.  
<br><br>
 
<li>    Make a three-dimensional map of your home or neighborhood
     using milk cartons for buildings. Draw a map of the block on
     a piece of cardboard, then cut up the cartons (or any other
     three-dimensional item) and use them to represent buildings.
     Use bottle tops or smaller boxes to add interest to the map,
     but try to keep the scale relationships correct.  
<br><br>
  
<li>    Use popular board games like "Game of the States" or "Trip
     Around the World" to teach your children about location,
     commerce, transportation, and the relationships among 
     different countries and areas of the world. Some of these
     games are available at public libraries. 
<br><br>
  
<li>    Make papier-mache' using strips of old newspaper and a paste
     made from flour and water. If children form balls by wrapping
     the strips of papier-mache around a balloon, they will develop
     a realistic understanding of the difficulties in making
     accurate globes. They can also use papier-mache to make models
     of hills and valleys.

<P>Every place has a personality. What makes a place special? What 
are the physical and cultural characteristics of your hometown? 
Is the soil sandy or rocky? Is the temperature warm or is it 
cold? If it has many characteristics, which are the most 
distinct?  </P>
 
<P>How do these characteristics affect the people living there? 
People change the character of a place. They speak a particular 
language, have styles of government and architecture, and form 
patterns of business. How have people shaped the landscapes? </P>
 <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
 <HR>
<H4><a name="Investigate">Investigate Your Neighborhood</a> </H4>

<ul> 
<li>    Walk around your neighborhood and look at what makes it
     unique. Point out differences from and similarities to other
     places. Can your children distinguish various types of homes
     and shops? Look at the buildings and talk about their uses. 
     Are there features built to conform with the weather or
     topography? Do the shapes of some buildings indicate how they
     were used in the past or how they're used now? These
     observations help children understand the character of a
     place.  
<br><br>

<li>    Show your children the historical, recreational, or natural
     points of interest in your town. What animals and plants live
     in your neighborhood? If you live near a harbor, pay it a
     visit, and tour a docked boat. You can even look up the
     shipping schedule in your local newspaper. If you live near
     a national park, a lake, a river, or a stream, take your
     children there and spend time talking about its uses.  
 <br><br>

<li>    Use songs to teach geography. "Home on the Range," "Red River
     Valley," and "This Land Is Your Land" conjure up images of
     place. Children enjoy folk songs of different countries like
     "Sur La Pont D'Avignon," "Guantanamara," and "London Bridge."
     When your children sing these songs, talk with them about the
     places they celebrate, locate them on the map, and discuss how
     the places are described.

<H4><a name="Study">Study the Weather</a> </H4>
 
<P>Weather has important geographic implications that affect the 
character of a place. The amount of sun or rain, heat or cold, 
the direction and strength of the wind, all determine such things
as how people dress, how well crops grow, and the extent to which
people will want to live in a particular spot.  </P>

<ul>
<li>    Watch the weather forecast on television or read the weather
     map in the newspaper. Save the maps for a month or more.  You
     can see changes over time, and compare conditions over several
     weeks and seasons. Reading the weather map helps children
     observe changes in the local climate.  
<br><br>
 
<li>    Use a weather map to look up the temperatures of cities around
     the world and discover how hot each gets in the summer and how
     cold each gets in the winter. Ask your children if they can
     think of reasons why different locations have different
     temperatures. Compare these figures with your town. Some
     children enjoy finding the place that is the hottest or the
     coldest. 
<br><br>

<li>    Make simple weather-related devices such as barometers,
     pinwheels, weather vanes, and wind chimes. Watch cloud
     formations and make weather forecasts. Talk about how these
     describe the weather in your town.

     restaurant, or treat them to ethnic snacks at a folk festival.
     Such an experience is an opportunity to talk about why people
     eat different foods. What ingredients in ethnic dishes are
     unique to a particular area? For example, why do the Japanese
     eat so much seafood? (If your children look for Japan on a map
     they will realize it is a country of many islands.) 
 <br><br>
 
<li>    Read stories from or about other countries, and books that
     describe journeys. Many children's books provide colorful
     images of different places and a sense of what it would be
     like to live in them. Drawings or photographs of distant
     places or situations can arouse interest in other lands. The
     Little House in the Big Woods, Holiday Tales of Sholem
     Aleichem, and The Polar Express are examples of books with
     descriptions of place that have transported the imaginations
     of many young readers. There is a bibliography at the end of
     this booklet, and your librarian will have more suggestions.

<H3><a name="RELATIONSHIPS">Relationships Within Places: Humans and Environments</a></H3>
 
<P>How do people adjust to their environment? What are the 
relationships among people and places? How do they change it to 
better suit their needs? Geographers examine where people live,
why they settled there, and how they use natural resources. For 
example, Hudson Bay, the site of the first European settlement in
Canada, is an area rich in wildlife and has sustained a trading
and fur trapping industry for hundreds of years. Yet the climate
there was described by early settlers as "nine months of ice
followed by three months of mosquitoes." People can and do adapt
to their natural surroundings.  </P>

<H4><a name="Notice_surroundings">Notice How You Control Your Surroundings </a></H4>
 
<P>Everyone controls his or her surroundings. Look at the way you 
arrange furniture in your home. You place the tables and chairs
in places that suit the shape of the room and the position of the
windows and doors. You also arrange the room according to how 
people will use it.  </P>

<ul>
<li>    Try different furniture arrangements with your children. If
     moving real furniture is too strenuous, try working with doll
     house furniture or paper cutouts. By cutting out paper to
     represent different pieces of furniture, children can begin
     to learn the mapmaker's skill in representing the 
     three-dimensional real world.  
<br><br>
 
<li>    Ask your children to consider what the yard might look like
     if you did not try to change it by mowing grass, raking leaves
     or planting shrubs or trees. You might add a window box if you
     don't have a yard. What would happen if you didn't water the
     plants?  
<br><br>
 
<li>    Walk your children around your neighborhood or a park  area
     and have them clean up litter. How to dispose of waste is a
     problem with a geographic dimension. 
<br><br>
 
<li>    Take your children to see some examples of how people have
     shaped their environment: bonsai gardens, reservoirs,
     terracing, or houses built into hills. Be sure to talk with
     them about how and why these phenomena came to be.  
<br><br>
 
<li>    If you don't live on a farm, try to visit one. Many cities and
     States maintain farm parks for just this purpose. Call the
     division of parks in your area to find out where there is one
     near you. Farmers use soil, water, and sun to grow crops. They
     use ponds or streams for water, and build fences to keep
     animals from running away.

<P>People don't always change their environment. Sometimes they are
shaped by it. Often people must build roads around mountains.
They must build bridges over rivers. They construct storm walls
to keep the ocean from sweeping over beaches. In some countries,
people near coasts build their houses on stilts to protect them
from storm tides or periodic floods.  </P>

<ul> 
<li>    Go camping. It is easy to understand why we wear long pants
     and shoes when there are rocks and brambles on the ground, and
     to realize the importance to early settlers of being near
     water when you no longer have the convenience of a faucet. 
<br><br>

<li>    If you go to a park, try to attend the nature shows that many
     parks provide. You and your children may learn about the local
     plants and wildlife and how the natural features have changed
     over time.

from one place to another? What are the patterns of movement of
people, products, and information? Regardless of where we live,
we rely upon each other for goods, services, and information. In
fact, most people interact with other places almost every day. We
depend on other places for the food, clothes, and even items like
the pencil and paper our children use in school. We also share
information with each other using telephones, newspapers, radio,

<li>    Play the license plate game. How many different States' plates
     can you identify, and what, if anything, does the license
     plate tell you about each State? You don't have to be in a car
     to play. You can look at the license plates of parked cars,
     or those traveling by when you are walking. Children can keep
     a record of the States whose plates they have seen. They can
     color in those  States on a map and illustrate them with
     characteristics described on the license plates. Some States
     have county names on their plates. If you live in one of these
     States, keeping track of the counties could be another
     interesting variation.  
<br><br>

<li>    Go around your house and look at where everything comes from.
     Examine the labels of the clothes you wear and think of where
     your food comes from. Why do bananas come from Central
     America? Why does the milk come from the local dairy? Perhaps
     your climate is too cold for bananas, and the milk is too
     perishable to travel far. How did the food get to your house? 
<br><br>
     
<li>    Tell your children where your ancestors came from. Find your
     family's countries of origin, and chart the birthplaces of
     relatives on a map. You can plot the routes they followed
     before they arrived at their present location. Why did they
     leave their previous home? Where do all your relatives live
     now? 
<br><br>
 
<li>    Have your children ask older relatives what their world was
     like when they were young. They can ask questions about
     transportation, heating and refrigeration, the foods they ate,
     the clothes they wore, and the schools they attended. Look at
     old pictures. How have things changed since Grandma was a
     child?  Grandparents and great aunts and uncles are usually
     delighted to share their memories with the younger generation,
     and they can pass on a wealth of information.

convey information from one person or place to another.  </P>

<ul> 
<li>    By watching television and listening to the radio, your

     the television shows they watch originate? What about radio
     shows? 
<br><br>
 
<li>    Ask your children how they would communicate with other
     people. Would they use the phone or write a letter?  Encourage
     them to write letters to relatives and friends. They may be

<P>How can places be described or compared? How can the Earth be
divided into regions for study? Geographers categorize regions in
two basic ways--physical and cultural. Physical regions are defined
by landform (continents and mountain ranges), climate, soil, and
natural vegetation. Cultural regions are  distinguished by
political, economic, religious, linguistic, agricultural, and

     areas in your home. Is there an upstairs and a downstairs? Is
     there an eating area and a sleeping area? Are there other
     "regions" in your home that can be described?  
<br><br>

<li>    Look at the physical regions in your community. Some
     neighborhoods grew up around hills, others developed on
     waterfronts or around parks. What physical regions exist in
     your hometown?

<li>    Take your children to visit the different political,
     residential, recreational, ethnic, and commercial regions of
     your city.  
<br><br>
 
<li>    Go to plays, movies, and puppet shows about people from
     different countries. These are often presented at libraries
     and museums. 
<br><br>
 
<li>    Give children geography lessons by tying in with ethnic
     holiday themes. Provide children with regional or ethnic
     clothes to wear. Some museums and libraries provide clothes
     children can borrow. Holidays provide an opportunity to learn
     about the customs of people around the world. You can use the
     library to discover how other people celebrate special days. 
 <br><br>
     
 <li>   Compare coins and stamps from other lands. They often contain
     information about the country. You may be able to find stamps
     from other countries where you work, or your children may get
     them from pen pals. Stamps tell many different kinds of things
     about a country, from its political leadership to native bird
     life. 
<br><br>
 
<li>    Learn simple words in different languages. Teach your children
     to count to 10 in other languages. They can also learn simple
     words like "hello," "goodbye," and "thank you." Look at the
     different alphabets or script from various regions. All these
     activities expose children to the abundance of the Earth's
     cultural treasures. Many libraries have language tapes and
     books, some especially for children. 
<br><br>
 
<li>    If you have friends who are from different countries or have
     either travelled or lived abroad, invite them over to talk 
     with your children. If they have pictures, so much the better. 
     What languages do they speak? How are their customs or dress
     similar to or different from yours?

<H3><a name="CONCLUSION">Conclusion</a> </H3>
 
<P>Geography is a way of thinking, of asking questions, of observing
and appreciating the world around us. You can help your children
learn by providing interesting activities for them, and by 
prompting them to ask questions about their surroundings.  </P>
 
<P>Set a good example, and help your children build precise mental 
images, by always using correct terms. Say, "We are going north 
to New York to visit Grandma, or west to Dallas to see Uncle 
John," rather than "up to New York" or "down to Dallas." Use 
words such as highway, desert, river, climate, and glacier; and 
explain concepts like city, state, and continent.  </P>
 
<P>Many of the words used in geography are everyday words. But, like
any other field of learning, geography has a language of its own.
(A glossary of basic geography terms appears below.)</P>

<P>Expose children to lots of maps and let them see you using them.
Get a good atlas as well as a dictionary. Atlases help us ask, 
and answer, questions about places and their relationships with 
other areas. Many States have atlases that are generally 
available through an agency of the state government.  </P>
 
<P>The activities suggested in this booklet are only a few examples
of the many ways that children learn geography. These activities
are designed to help parents find ways to include geographic 
thinking in their children's early experiences. We hope they will
stimulate your thinking and that you will develop many more 
activities on your own. </P>

<h3> <a name="Periodontal Diseases">Periodontal Diseases</a></h3>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>     How you say it: Periodontal (pear ee oh don tal) Diseases
The word 'periodontal' comes from the two Greek words that mean
"around the tooth."</P>


<P><B>What are periodontal diseases?</B></P>


<P>     Infections of the gum and bone that hold the teeth in
place. They are commonly called gum diseases.</P>


<P><B>What causes these diseases?</B></P>


<P>     Dental plaque--a sticky mass of harmful germs. Dental
scientists have found that about a half dozen of the nearly 300
germs found in the mouth can cause gum diseases.</P>


<P><B>Can I prevent gum diseases?</B></P>


<P>     Yes! You can prevent them by removing dental plaque.</P>


<P><B>How?</B></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

   	<LI> Brush your teeth twice a day

   	<LI> Floss your teeth once a day

   	<LI> Have your teeth cleaned professionally at least once a
     	year

   	<LI> Also once a year: have a check-up by the dentist to make
     	sure any signs of gum diseases are caught early.
</UL>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<B>How can I tell if I'm removing all the plaque?</B>


<P>     Dental plaque is hard to see unless it's stained. You can
stain plaque by chewing red "disclosing tablets," found at
grocery stores and drug stores, or by using a cotton swab to
smear green food coloring on your teeth. The red or green color
left on the teeth will show you where there is still
plaque--and where you have to brush again to remove it. Ask
your dentist or dental hygienist if your plaque removal
techniques are o.k.</P>

<P>     If plaque is not removed, you may develop gingivitis, a
condition that can be the first step toward the breakdown of
your gums and bone that hold teeth in place.</P>

<center>
Poor Oral Hygiene  leads to  Plaque Build-Up leads to<BR>
Gingivitis leads to  Periodontitis  leads to  Possible Tooth Loss
</center>

<P>     Gingivitis is an infection of the gums. As a result of the
infection, the gums become red, inflamed and can bleed during
brushing.</P>

<P>     It is a mild form of gum disease that does not include any
loss of the bone and tissue that hold teeth in place.
Gingivitis can usually be reversed with regular brushing and
flossing.</P>

<P>     Gingivitis is the first sign that something is wrong
with your gums. If it is not treated it can progress to a more
destructive type of gum disease called periodontitis.</P>

<P>     Periodontitis is an infection of the tissues that help
anchor the teeth. The infection can lead to loss of the bone
that holds the tooth in its socket and might lead to tooth
loss.</P>

<P>     Since periodontitis affects more than just the gums, it is
not controllable with regular brushing and flossing.
Periodontitis must be treated by a dentist or periodontist (a
dentist who specializes in treating gum diseases).</P>

<P>     In its early stages, periodontitis usually does not have
obvious symptoms. Pain, loosening of teeth, and abscess do not
occur until the disease is very advanced. So it's important to
visit the dentist on a regular basis so he or she can check for
early signs of gum diseases.</P>


<P>If gum diseases are not treated, the teeth may loosen and fall
out.</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P><B>Will my dentist refer me to a periodontist?</B></P>


<P>     Your dentist might refer you to a periodontist if you have
an advanced case of a gum disease, or if you have a milder form
that is not responding to regular treatment.</P>


<P><B>Who gets gum diseases?</B></P>


<P>     People usually don't show signs of advanced gum diseases
until they are in their 30s or 40s. But it is not uncommon for
teenagers to have gingivitis, the early stage of gum disease.
The most common types of gum diseases develop as a result of
neglect--poor brushing and no flossing.</P>


<P>Special Cases</P>


<P>     Teenagers can develop a very severe form of gum disease
called juvenile periodontitis. Scientists think this rare but
aggressive type of gum disease might be inherited. Pregnancy,
diabetes and other medical conditions also may trigger gum
diseases. Smoking can make you prone to gum diseases. In fact,
one study showed that smokers are five times more likely than
nonsmokers to have gum diseases.</P>

<h3> <a name="Diagnosis">Diagnosis</a></h3>

<P>     Three ways a dentist can tell if you have periodontitis:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
   	<LI> By looking at the gums to see if they are red, swollen,
     	and inflamed and by checking for tartar--hardened
     	plaque---beneath the gumline. The dentist also will check
     	for gum recession.

   	<LI> By using an instrument called a probe to see if the gums
     	bleed when they are probed and by checking for and
     	measuring the periodontal pockets--spaces that form when
     	unhealthy gums pull away from teeth. Usually, there is a
     	space of 1-3mm between healthy gums and teeth. Deeper
     	pockets may signal advanced disease.

   	<LI> By taking mouth x-rays to check for any loss of the bone
     	that helps anchor teeth, another sign of periodontitis.
</UL>


<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>The dentist uses the probe to measure the periodontal pocket.
Most people find probing only mildly uncomfortable.</P>

<P><B>How are gum diseases treated?</B></P>


<P>     By controlling the infection.</P>

<P>     To control the infection... the dentist or hygienist removes the plaque
that contains
     harmful germs</P>


<P><B>How?</B></P>


<P>     By scaling and root planing</P>

<P>     These are deep-cleaning procedures that get rid of the
plaque.</P>

<P>     Scaling means scraping off the tartar from above and
beneath the gumline. Planing the tooth root until it is smooth
gets rid of rough spots where. germs gather and allows the gums
to heal closer to the teeth.</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>Scaling and Planing</P>

<ul>   <li> Your dentist might also prescribe a special anti-germ
     mouthrinse containing a chemical called chlorhexidine.
     These are the only mouthrinses approved for treating
     periodontitis.

   <li> Sometimes, the dentist will prescribe an antibiotic that
     will help kill the germs that are causing periodontitis.
</ul>
<P>     After the dentist scales and planes your teeth, you must
brush and floss at home to keep the plaque from returning. You
also will have to have a checkup with the dentist to see if the
treatment has helped. Scaling and planing may need to be
repeated every three to four months.</P>


<P><B>What About Gum Surgery?</B></P>


<P>     Surgery might be necessary if: 1) scaling and planing do
not bring the gum disease under control, or 2) the gum disease
is very advanced and includes bone loss around the teeth.</P>

<P>Flap Surgery</P>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>     A local anesthetic is given so the patient will not feel
any pain or discomfort. Flap surgery involves lifting back the
gums, removing the tartar, and then sewing the gums back in
place.</P>


<P><B>Can baking soda help periodontitis?</B></P>


<P>     Although baking soda and most toothpastes can be used to
remove dental plaque, there is no evidence that they can stop
or reverse tissue and bone loss caused by periodontitis.</P>


<P><B>I've heard a lot about lasers recently. How do they work and
can they be used to treat periodontal diseases?</B></P>


<P>     Simply put, a surgical laser works by emitting a
concentrated beam of light strong enough to cut through tissue.
Lasers can be used on soft tissue for certain surgical
procedures related to the treatment of periodontal diseases. At
this time, through, the Food and Drug Administration has not
approved lasers for use on hard tissue--teeth and bone.</P>

<P>     Research is under way to see if lasers can be used on
teeth and bone.</P>


<P>Remember:</P>

<P>Prevent gum diseases by . . .</P>

<P>New X-Ray Technology</P>
<ul>
   <li> Computer-linked probes. A computer attached to the probe
     regulates the probing pressure so it is always the same.
     The computer also can compare the results of the current
     test to the previous one, since it stores measurements
     from each reading.

   <li> Temperature probe. Detects temperature of the periodontal
     pockets to 1/100th of a degree centigrade. The hotter the
     site, the more likely there is gum disease.

   <li> New X-ray technology:

   <li> Taking x-rays. Taking x-rays with an instrument similar to
     that found in a home video camera uses much less radiation
     than does the standard x-ray.

  <li> Reading x-rays. The computer can compare two x-rays and
     highlight even the smallest changes in bone surrounding
     the teeth. Using the computer allows dentists to see
     details that would not be visible on a regular x-ray.

   <li> Determining which germ is causing the infection. Knowing
     what type of bacterium is causing the infection could help
     determine the best treatment. Some bacteria can be removed
     by scraping plaque off the teeth, a process known as
     scaling. Others are harder to get rid of and may require
     an antibiotic--a medicine that can kill germs.

   <li> Quick test for identifying active gum disease. The dentist
     takes a sample of fluid leaked from the gums that is found
     at the base of the teeth. It is analyzed for substances
     associated with active tissue and bone destruction.<BR><BR>

<P>Treatment</P>


<P>On The Horizon:</P>

<ul>
   <li> Slow-release: antibiotics placed directly: into
     periodontal pockets. Tiny fibers or gels containing
     antibiotics are put into the pockets next to the tooth
     root where the medication seeps onto the affected area.

   <li> Barrier membranes. During flap surgery, the dentist
     inserts these small, mesh-like pieces of fabric between
     the gum flap and the affected teeth. The mesh helps the
     soft tissue and bone grow back in place. A second surgery
     is needed to remove the mesh. The newest mesh will be able
     to break down and be absorbed by the body, eliminating the
     need for the second surgical procedure.
</ul>

<P>[Graphic Omitted]</P>

<P>Barrier Membrane</P>
<ul>
   <li> High-powered ultrasonic cleaning. A cleaning instrument
     that uses high-frequency sound waves is useful in breaking
     up tartar and removing plaque.
</ul>
[Graphic Omitted]

<P>Ultra Cleaning Instrument</P>
<ul>
   <li> Chemically modified antibiotics. These drugs lack the
     antibiotic property but have the ability to inhibit tissue
     destruction. They should help stop gum disease and should
     be safe for long-term use, without causing bacterial
     resistance.

   <li> Low-Dose antibiotics. Researchers have found that low
     doses of doxycycline can slow the destruction of tissue
     and bone. At low doses, the drug doesn't seem to encourage
     the development of antibiotic-resistant germs.

   <li> NSAIDs--Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs. These
     aspirin-like medicines have been shown to slow bone loss
     in patients with periodontitis. Researchers are testing
     these medications.<BR><BR>

 <H3>Definition of Cerebral Palsy</H3>

     <p>Cerebral palsy is a condition caused by damage to the brain,
usually occurring before,during or shortly following birth. 
"Cerebral" refers to the brain and "palsy" to a disorder of
movement or posture.  It is neither progressive nor communicable. 
It is also not "curable" in the accepted sense, although
education, therapy and applied technology can help persons with
cerebral palsy lead productive lives.  It is not a disease and
should never be  referred to as such.  It can range from mild to
severe.</p> 

     <p>The causes of cerebral palsy include illness during
pregnancy, premature delivery, or lack of oxygen supply to the
baby; or it may occur early in life as a result of an accident,
lead poisoning, viral infection, child abuse, or other factors. 
Chief among the causes is an insufficient amount of oxygen or
poor flow of blood reaching the fetal or newborn brain.  This can
be caused by premature separation of the placenta, an awkward
birth position, labor that goes on too long or is too abrupt, or
interference with the umbilical cord.  Other causes may be
associated with premature birth, RH or A-B-O blood type
incompatibility between parents, infection of the mother with
German measles or other viral diseases in early pregnancy, and
microorganisms that attack the newborn's central nervous system. 
Lack of good prenatal care may also be a factor. A less common
type is acquired cerebral palsy: head injury is the most frequent
cause, usually the result of motor vehicle accidents, falls, or
child abuse.</p>  
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Incidence"></a>

<h3>Incidence</h3>

     <p>Between 500,000 - 700,000 Americans have some degree of
cerebral palsy.  About 3,000 babies are born with the disorder
each year, and another 500 or so acquire it in the early years
of life.</p>
 <a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>

<h3>Characteristics</h3> 

     <p>There are three main types of cerebral palsy: spastic --
stiff and difficult movement;athetoid -- involuntary and
uncontrolled movement; and ataxic -- disturbed sense of balance
and depth perception.  There may be a combination of these types
for any one individual.  Other types do occur, although
infrequently.</p> 

     <p>Cerebral palsy is characterized by an inability to fully
control motor function.  Depending on which part of the brain has
been damaged and the degree of involvement of the central
nervous system, one or more of the following may occur: spasms;
tonal problems; involuntary movement; disturbance in gait and
mobility; seizures; abnormal sensation and perception;
impairment of sight, hearing or speech; and mental retardation.</p> 
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Educational"></a> 

<h3>Developmental, Educational, and Employment Implications</h3>

     <p>Early identification of cerebral palsy can lessen
developmental problems and lead to appropriate intervention when
it helps the most.  Early intervention programs are
family-centered in which professionals and families work together
with the child in specific activities.  Educators,physical and
occupational therapists, social workers, speech- language
pathologists, psychologists and physicians can assist families by
providing information and education.</p>
 
<p>Activities for children with cerebral palsy may include:
<ul>
     <li>    speech and language therapy;
     <li>    occupational therapy;
     <li>    physical therapy;
     <li>    medical intervention;
     <li>    family support services;
     <li>    early education; and
     <li>    assistive technology.
</ul>
</p>

      <p>As a child gets older and begins formal schooling, the
intensity of services will vary from individual to individual. 
Persons with cerebral palsy are usually able to attain a
substantial degree of independence but, in some cases, may need
considerable assistance.  Services for the school age child may
include continuing therapy, regular or special education,
counseling, technical support, community integration
opportunities, recreation and possible personal attendants.  A
key factor seems to be a supportive family.  People extensively
affected by cerebral palsy can still be highly functional and
independent.  The HEATH Resource Center, the clearinghouse on
postsecondary education for individuals with disabilities, states
that a significant number of students with cerebral palsy are
enrolled in colleges and universities.</p> 

     <p>Important advances have taken place in the last 15 years
which have had a great effect on the long-term well-being of
children born with cerebral palsy.  Advanced technology,
including computers and engineering devices, has been applied to
the needs of persons with cerebral palsy.  Technological
innovations have been developed in the areas of speech and
communication, self-care, and adapting living arrangements and
work sites.  The future may bring even more significant
applications.</p> 

     <p>Another important development has been the increased ability
of persons with disabilities,including those who have cerebral
palsy and other severe disabilities, to live independently in the
community.  Adults with cerebral palsy are now living, with or
without assistance, in their own apartments or townhouses. 
Independent Living Centers have also proven to be important
resources for persons with disabilities.</p>

<H3>Definition of Down Syndrome</H3>

<P>     Down syndrome is the most common and readily identifiable
chromosomal condition associated with mental retardation.  It is
caused by a chromosomal abnormality:  for some unexplained
reason, an accident in cell development results in 47 instead of
the usual 46 chromosomes.  This extra chromosome changes the
orderly development of the body and brain. In most cases, the
diagnosis of Down syndrome is made according to results from a
chromosome test administered shortly after birth.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Incidence"></a>
<H3> Incidence</H3> 

<P>     Approximately 4,000 children with Down syndrome are born in
the U.S. each year, or about 1 in every 800 to 1,000 live births. 
Although parents of any age may have child with Down syndrome,
the incidence is higher for women over 35.  Most common forms of
the syndrome do not usually occur more than once in a family.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
 <H3>Characteristics</H3> 

<P>     There are over 50 clinical signs of Down syndrome, but it is
rare to find all or even most of them in one person.  Some common
characteristics include:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>   Poor muscle tone 
     	<LI>    Slanting eyes with folds of skin at the inner corners
          	(called epicanthal folds) 
     	<LI>    Hyperflexibility (excessive ability to extend the
          	joints) 
     	<LI>    Short, broad hands with a single crease across the palm
          	on one or both hands 
     	<LI>    Broad feet with short toes 
     	<LI>    Flat bridge of the nose 
     	<LI>    Short, low-set ears 
     	<LI>    Short neck 
     	<LI>    Small head 
     	<LI>    Small oral cavity 
     	<LI>    Short, high-pitched cries in infancy 
	</UL>

<P>     Individuals with Down syndrome are usually smaller than
their non-disabled peers, and their physical as well as
intellectual development is slower.</P>

<P>     Besides having a distinct physical appearance, children with
Down syndrome frequently have specific health-related problems. 
A lowered resistance to infection makes these children
more prone to respiratory problems.  Visual problems such as
crossed eyes and far- or nearsightedness are higher in those with
Down syndrome, as are mild to moderate hearing loss and speech
difficulty.</P>

<P>     Approximately one third of babies born with Down syndrome
have heart defects, most of which are now successfully
correctable.  Some individuals are born with gastrointestinal
tract problems that can be surgically corrected.</P>

<P>     Some people with Down syndrome also may have a condition
known as Atlantoaxial Instability, a misalignment of the top two
vertebrae of the neck.  This condition makes these individuals
more prone to injury if they participate in activities which
overextend or flex the neck.  Parents are urged to have their
child examined by a physician to determine whether or not their
child should be restricted from sports and activities which place
stress on the neck. Although this misalignment is a potentially
serious condition, proper diagnosis can help prevent serious
injury.</P>

<P>     Children with Down syndrome may have a tendency to become
obese as they grow older. Besides having negative social
implications, this weight gain threatens these individuals'
health and longevity.  A supervised diet and exercise program may
help reduce this problem.</P>

<a name="Educational"></a> 
 <H3>Educational and Employment Implications</H3> 

<P>     Shortly after a diagnoses of Down syndrome is confirmed,
parents should be encouraged to enroll their child in an infant
development/early intervention program.  These programs offer
parents special instruction in teaching their child language,
cognitive, self-help, and social skills, and specific exercises
for gross and fine motor development.  Research has shown that
stimulation during early developmental stages improves the
child's chances of developing to his or her fullest potential. 
Continuing education, positive public attitudes, and a
stimulating home environment have also been found to promote the
child's overall development.</P>

<P>     Just as in the normal population, there is a wide variation
in mental abilities, behavior,and developmental progress in
individuals with Down syndrome.  Their level of retardation may
range from mild to severe, with the majority functioning in the
mild to moderate range.  Due to these individual differences, it
is impossible to predict future achievements of children with
Down syndrome.</P>


<P>     Because of the range of ability in children with Down
syndrome it is important for families and all members of the
school's education team to place few limitations on potential
capabilities.  It may be effective to emphasize concrete concepts
rather than abstract ideas. Teaching tasks in a step-by-step
manner with frequent reinforcement and consistent feedback has
been proven successful.  Improved public acceptance of persons
with disabilities along with increased opportunities for adults
with disabilities to live and work independently in the
community, have expanded goals for individuals with Down
syndrome.  Independent Living Centers, group shared and
supervised apartments and support services in the community have
proven to be important resources for persons with disabilities.   </P>

<H3>Definition of Visual Impairments</H3>

<P>     The terms partially sighted, low vision, legally blind, and
totally blind are used in the educational context to describe
students with visual impairments.  They are defined as follows: </P>

<ul>
     <li>    "Partially sighted" indicates some type of visual
problem has resulted in a need for special education 

     <li>    "Low vision" generally refers to a severe visual
impairment, not necessarily limited to distance vision.  Low
vision applies to all individuals with sight who are unable to
read the newspaper at a normal viewing distance, even with the
aid of eyeglasses or contact lenses.  They use a combination of
vision and other senses to learn, although they may require
adaptations in lighting or the size of print, and, sometimes,
braille 

     <li>    "Legally blind" indicates that a person has less than
20/200 vision in the better eye or a very limited field of vision
(20 degrees at its widest point)   

     <li>    Totally blind students learn via braille or other
non-visual media 
</ul>

<P>     Visual impairment is the consequence of a functional loss of
vision, rather than the eye disorder itself.  Eye disorders which
can lead to visual impairments can include retinal degeneration,
albinism, cataracts, glaucoma, muscular problems that result in
visual disturbances,corneal disorders, diabetic retinopathy,
congenital disorders, and infection.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Incidence"></a>
<H3> Incidence</H3> 

<P>     The rate at which visual impairments occur in individuals
under the age of 18 is 12.2 per 1,000.  Severe visual impairments
(legally or totally blind) occur at a rate of .06 per 1,000.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
 <H3>Characteristics</H3> 

<P>     The effect of visual problems on a child's development
depends on the severity, type of loss, age at which the condition
appears, and overall functioning level of the child.  Many
children who have multiple disabilities may also have visual
impairments resulting in motor, cognitive, and/or social
developmental delays.</P>

<P>     A young child with visual impairments has little reason to
explore interesting objects in the environment and, thus, may
miss opportunities to have experiences and to learn.  This lack
of exploration may continue until learning becomes motivating or
until intervention begins.</P>

<P>     Because the child cannot see parents or peers, he or she may
be unable to imitate social behavior or understand nonverbal
cues.  Visual handicaps can create obstacles to a growing
child's independence.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Educational"></a> 
 <H3>Educational Implications</H3> 

<P>     Children with visual impairments should be assessed early to
benefit from early intervention programs, when applicable. 
Technology in the form of computers and low-vision optical and
video aids enable many partially sighted, low vision and blind
children to participate in regular class activities.  Large print
materials, books on tape, and braille books are available.</P>

<P>     Students with visual impairments may need additional help
with special equipment and modifications in the regular
curriculum to emphasize listening skills, communication,
orientation and mobility, vocation/career options, and daily
living skills.  Students with low vision or those who are legally
blind may need help in using their residual vision more
efficiently and in working with special aids and materials. 
Students who have visual impairments combined with other types
of disabilities have a greater need for an interdisciplinary
approach and may require greater emphasis on self care and daily
living skills.</P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is
issuing these guidelines to help prevent children from strangling
or getting entangled in the neck and waist drawstrings of upper
outerwear garments, such as jackets and sweatshirts.  Drawstrings
on children's clothing are a hidden hazard that can lead to
deaths and injuries when they catch on such items as playground
equipment, bus doors, or cribs.  From January 1985 through
September 1995, CPSC received reports of 17 deaths and 42 non-
fatal incidents involving the entanglement of children's clothing
drawstrings. </P>

<P>     These guidelines are intended to provide consumers with
information to help them prevent hazards with garments now in
their possession and make informed purchasing choices in the
future.  Manufacturers and retailers should also be aware of
these hazards, and are encouraged to consider this information in
the production and sale of children's garments.   </P>

<P>     CPSC's drawstring guidelines do not represent a standard or
mandatory requirement set by the agency.  And, while CPSC does
not sanction them as the only method of minimizing drawstring
injuries, CPSC believes that these guidelines will help prevent
children from strangling by their clothing drawstrings.</P>

<a name="Deaths And Injuries"></a>
<H3>Deaths And Injuries </H3> 

<H4>Hood/Neck Drawstrings</H4>

<P>     Over two-thirds of the deaths and non-fatal incidents
involved hood/neck drawstrings.  The majority of these cases
involved playground slides.  Typically, as the child descended
the slide, the toggle or knot on the drawstring got caught in a
small space or gap at the top of the slide.  Examples of catch
points include a protruding bolt or a tiny space between the
guardrail and the slide platform.  As the child hung by the
drawstring, suspended part way down the slide, the drawstring
pulled the garment up taut to the neck, strangling the child. 
Victims of these cases ranged in age from 2 through 8 years old. </P>

<P>     In one case, a five-year-old girl strangled after the
drawstring on her jacket hood caught on the slide at her daycare
center.</P>

<P>     One incident involved a fence. A four-year-old girl
strangled after the hood string on her coat became entangled on a
fence as she attempted to climb over it.</P>

<P>     Two strangulations occurred in cribs. In one case, an
eighteen-month-old child was found hanging from a corner post of
his crib by the tied cord of the hooded sweatshirt he was
wearing. Another little girl was hanged by the drawstring of her
sweatshirt in her crib the first time she wore the sweatshirt. </P>

     <H4>Waist/Bottom Drawstrings</H4>

<P>     Almost one-third of the deaths and non-fatal incidents
involved drawstrings at the waist/bottom of children's garments. 
Most of these involved children whose waist or bottom strings of
their jackets got caught on school bus handrails or in school bus
doors.  In most cases, the drawstring at the bottom of the jacket
snagged in a small space in the hand rail as the child was
getting off  the bus. Without the child or bus driver realizing
that the drawstring was caught on the handrail, the bus doors
closed and the bus drove away, dragging the child.  Deaths have
occurred when children were run over by the bus. Victims of these
school bus cases ranged in age from 7 through 14 years old.</P>

<P>     A 14-year-old boy was killed when the long, trailing
drawstring on his jacket got caught in the closed door of a
moving school bus and he was eventually pulled beneath the bus
and run over. </P>

<H3>Guidelines For Hood/Neck Drawstrings</H3>

     <H4>Recommendation</H4>

<P>     CPSC recommends that parents or caregivers completely remove
the hood and neck strings from all children's outerwear,
including jackets and sweatshirts, sized 2T to 12.  CPSC
technical staff has concluded that strings at the neck that are
shortened still may present a strangulation hazard.  Therefore,
CPSC recommends that consumers purchase children's outerwear that
has alternative closures, such as snaps, buttons, velcro, and
elastic.  CPSC also recommends that manufacturers and retailers
provide outerwear with these alternative closures, rather than
drawstrings at the head/neck area.</P>

<a name="Guidelines For Waist/Bottom Drawstrings"></a>
<H3>Guidelines For Waist/Bottom Drawstrings</H3>

     <H4>Recommendation</H4>

<P>     For outerwear sized 2T to 16, CPSC recommends to consumers,
manufacturers, and retailers that the ends of waist/bottom
drawstrings measure no more than 3 inches from where the strings
extend out of the garment when it is expanded to its fullest
width.  Also, the drawstring should be sewn to the garment at its
midpoint so the string can not be pulled out through one side,
making it long enough to catch on something.  CPSC also
recommends eliminating toggles or knots at the ends of all
drawstrings.  Shortening the length of drawstrings at the waist
and bottom of children's outerwear reduces the risk that the
strings will become entangled in objects such as school bus doors
or other moving objects.</P>

<H3>Are You Planning To Buy, Rent, Or Renovate A Home Built Before
1978?</H3>

<P>     Many houses and apartments built before 1978 have paint that
contains lead (called lead-based paint). Lead from paint, chips,
and dust can pose serious health hazards if not taken care of
properly. By 1996, federal law will require that individuals
receive certain information before renting, buying, or renovating
pre-1978 housing:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>LANDLORDS will have to disclose known information on lead-based
paint hazards before leases take effect. Leases will include a
federal form about lead-based paint.

<br><br><LI>SELLERS will have to disclose known information on lead-based
paint hazards before selling a house. Sales contracts will
include a federal form about lead-based paint in the building.
Buyers will have up to 10 days to check for lead hazards. 

<br><br><LI>RENOVATORS will have to give you this pamphlet before starting
work.
</UL>

<P>If you want more information on these requirements, call the
National Lead Information Clearinghouse at 1-800-424-LEAD.</P>

<P>FACT: Lead exposure can harm young children and babies even
before they are born.</P>

<P>FACT: Even children that seem healthy can have high levels of
lead in their bodies.</P>

<P>FACT: People can get lead in their bodies by breathing or
swallowing lead dust, or by eating soil or paint chips with lead
in them.</P>

<P>FACT: People have many options for reducing lead hazards. In most
cases, lead-based paint that is in good condition is not a
hazard.</P>

</UL>

<P>     If your child is older than 1 year, talk to your doctor
about whether your child needs testing.</P>

<P>     Your doctor or health center can do blood tests. They are
inexpensive and sometimes free. Your doctor will explain what the
test results mean. Treatment can range from changes in your diet
to medication or a hospital stay.</P>

Where Lead-Based Paint Is Found

<P>     In general, the older your home, the more likely it has
lead-based paint.</P>

<P>     Many homes built before 1978 have lead-based paint. In 1978,
the federal government banned lead-based paint from housing. Lead
can be found:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>In homes in the city, country, or suburbs.

	<LI>In apartments, single-family homes, and both private and public
	housing.

	<LI>Inside and outside of the house. 

	<LI>In soil around a home. (Soil can pick up lead from exterior
	 paint, or other sources such as past use of leaded gas in cars.)<BR><BR>

<H3>Where Lead Is Likely To Be A Hazard</H3>

<P>     Lead from paint chips, which you can see, and lead dust,
which you can't always see, can both be serious hazards.</P>

<P>     Lead-based paint that is in good condition is usually not a
hazard.</P>

<P>     Peeling, chipping, chalking, or cracking lead-based paint is
a hazard and needs immediate attention.</P>

<P>     Lead-based paint may also be a hazard when found on surfaces
that children can chew or that get a lot of wear-and-tear. These
areas include:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Windows and window sills.
	<LI>Doors and door frames.
	<LI>Stairs, railings, and banisters.
	<LI>Porches and fences.
</UL>

<P>     Lead dust can form when lead-based paint is dry scraped, dry
sanded, or heated. Dust also forms when painted surfaces bump or
rub together. Lead chips and dust can get on surfaces and objects
that people touch. Settled lead dust can reenter the air when
people vacuum, sweep, or walk through it.</P>

<P>     Lead in soil can be a hazard when children play in bare soil
or when people bring soil into the house on their shoes. Call
your state agency (see below) to find out about soil testing for
lead.</P>

<a name="Your"></a>
<H3>Checking Your Home For Lead Hazards</H3>

<P>     Just knowing that a home has lead-based paint may not tell
you if there is a hazard.</P>

<P>     You can get your home checked for lead hazards in one of two
ways, or both:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A paint inspection tells you the lead content of every painted
	surface in your home. It won't tell you whether the paint is a
	 hazard or how you should deal with it.

	<LI>A risk assessment tells you if there are any sources of serious
	lead exposure (such as peeling paint and lead dust). It also
	tells you what actions to take to address these hazards.
</UL>

<P>     Have qualified professionals do the work. The federal
government is writing standards for inspectors and risk
assessors. Some states might already have standards in place.
Call your state agency for help with locating qualified
professionals in your area (see below). </P>

<P>     Trained professionals use a range of methods when checking
your home, including:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Visual inspection of paint condition and location.
	<LI>Lab tests of paint samples.
	<LI>Surface dust tests.
	<LI>A portable x-ray fluorescence machine.
</UL>

<P>     Home test kits for lead are available, but the federal
government is still testing their reliability.  These tests
should not be the only method used before doing renovations or to
assure safety.</P>

What You Can Do Now To Protect Your Family

<P>     If you suspect that your house has lead hazards, you can
take some immediate steps to reduce your family's risk:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI>If you rent, notify your landlord of peeling or chipping paint.

	<LI>Clean up paint chips immediately.


<LI>Clean floors, window frames, window sills, and other surfaces
weekly. Use a mop or sponge with warm water and a general
all-purpose cleaner or a cleaner made specifically for lead.
<B>REMEMBER: NEVER MIX AMMONIA AND BLEACH PRODUCTS TOGETHER SINCE
THEY CAN FORM A DANGEROUS GAS.</B>

<LI>Thoroughly rinse sponges and mop heads after cleaning dirty or
dusty areas.

<LI>Wash children's hands often, especially before they eat and
before nap time and bed time.

<LI>Keep play areas clean. Wash bottles, pacifiers, toys, and
stuffed animals regularly.

<LI>Keep children from chewing window sills or other painted
surfaces.

<LI>Clean or remove shoes before entering your home to avoid
tracking in lead from soil.

<LI>Make sure children eat nutritious, low-fat meals high in iron
and calcium, such as spinach and low-fat dairy products. Children
with good diets absorb less lead.<BR><BR>

<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How To Significantly Reduce Lead Hazards</H3>

<P>     Removing lead improperly can increase the hazard to your
family by spreading even more lead dust around the house.</P>

<P>     Always use a professional who is trained to remove lead
hazards safely.</P>

<P>     In addition to day-to-day cleaning and good nutrition:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI>You can temporarily reduce lead hazards by taking actions like
repairing damaged painted surfaces and planting grass to cover
soil with high lead levels. These actions (called "interim
controls") are not permanent solutions and will not eliminate
all risks of exposure. <br><br>

<LI>To permanently remove lead hazards, you must hire a lead
"abatement" contractor. Abatement (or permanent hazard
elimination) methods include removing, sealing, or enclosing
lead-based paint with special materials. Just painting over the
hazard with regular paint is not enough.

</ul>
<P>     Always hire a person with special training for correcting
lead problems--someone who knows how to do this work safely and
has the proper equipment to clean up thoroughly. If possible,
hire a certified lead abatement contractor. Certified contractors
will employ qualified workers and follow strict safety rules as
set by their state or by the federal government.</P>

<P>     Call your state agency (see below) for help with locating
qualified contractors in your area and to see if financial
assistance is available.</P>

<a name="Remodeling"></a>
<H3>Remodeling Or Renovating A Home With Lead-Based Paint</H3>

<P>     If not conducted properly, certain types of renovations can
release lead from paint and dust into the air.</P>

<P>     Take precautions before you begin remodeling or renovations
that disturb painted surfaces (such as scraping off paint or
tearing out walls):</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Have the area tested for lead-based paint.


<br><br><li> Do not use a dry scraper, belt-sander, propane torch, or heat
gun to remove lead-based paint. These actions create large
amounts of lead dust and fumes. Lead dust can remain in your home
long after the work is done.

<br><br><li> Temporarily move your family (especially children and pregnant
women) out of the apartment or house until the work is done and
the area is properly cleaned. If you can't move your family, at
least completely seal off the work area.

<br><br><li> Follow other safety measures to reduce lead hazards. You can
find out about other safety measures by calling 1-800-424-LEAD.
Ask for the brochure "Reducing Lead Hazards When Remodeling Your
Home." This brochure explains what to do before, during, and
after renovations.
</UL>

<P>     If you have already completed renovations or remodeling that
could have released lead-based paint or dust, get your young
children tested and follow the steps outlined above.</P>

<H3>Other Sources Of Lead</H3>

<P>     While paint, dust, and soil are the most common lead
hazards, other lead sources also exist.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
    	<LI>Drinking water -- Your home might have plumbing with lead or
lead solder. Call your local health department or water supplier
to find out about testing your water. You cannot see, smell, or
taste lead, and boiling your water will not get rid of lead. If
you think your plumbing might have lead in it:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
    	<LI>Use only cold water for drinking and cooking.

    	<LI> Run water for 15 to 30 seconds before drinking it,
       especially if you have not used your water for a few hours.
</UL>

<LI>The job -- If you work with lead, you could bring it home on
your hands or clothes. Shower and change clothes before coming
home. Launder your clothes separately from the rest of your
family's.

<LI>Old painted toys and furniture.

<LI>Food and liquids stored in lead crystal or lead-glazed pottery
or porcelain.

<LI>Lead smelters or other industries that release lead into the
air.

<LI>Hobbies that use lead, such as making pottery or stained glass,
or refinishing furniture.

<LI>Folk remedies that contain lead, such as "greta" and "azarcon"
used to treat an upset stomach.<BR><BR>

<H4>What is otitis media?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Otitis media is an inflammation in the middle ear (the area behind the eardrum) that is usually   associated with a buildup of fluid. The fluid may      or may not be infected.</p>

<li>Symptoms, severity, frequency, and length of   the condition vary. At one extreme is a single  short period of thin, clear, noninfected fluid without any pain or fever but with a slight  decrease in hearing ability. The other extreme is   repeated bouts with infection, thick "glue-like"   fluid, and possible complications such as permanent hearing loss.</p>

<li>Fortunately, with early identification, serious   medical complications can be controlled with   medicine or surgery. However, there is one   problem that nearly always occurs with all types   of otitis media-fluctuating hearing loss.
</ul>


<H4>How common is otitis media?</H4>
     
<ul>
<li>Otitis media occurs most frequently in children.
 In fact, it ranks second to the common cold as the most common health problem in preschool children. Fifty percent of children have had at least one episode by one year of age. Between one and three years, 35% will have had repeated episodes. For school children, an estimated 5 million school days are missed every year due to otitis media.</ul>

<H4>Why is otitis media so common in children?</H4>

<ul>
<li>The Eustachian tube, a passage between the middle ear and the back of the throat, is smaller   and more nearly horizontal in children than in adults. Therefore, it can be more easily blocked by conditions such as large adenoids and      infections. Until the Eustachian tube changes in      size and angle, children are more susceptible to  otitis media.</ul>

<H4>How can otitis media cause a hearing loss?</H4>
<ul>
<li>Three tiny bones in the middle ear carry sound 
vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.
When fluid is present, the vibrations are not      transmitted efficiently and sound energy is lost. The result may be a mild or even a moderate hearing loss. Therefore, some speech sounds may be muffled or inaudible.<br><br>

<li>Generally, this type of hearing loss is temporary. However, when otitis media occurs over and over again, damage to the eardrum, the bones of the ear, or even the hearing nerve can occur and cause permanent hearing loss.</ul>


<H4>Can hearing loss due to otitis media cause  speech and language problems?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Children learn speech and language from  listening to other people talk. The first few years of life are especially critical for this development.
<br><br>
<li>If a hearing loss exists, a child does not get      full benefit of language learning experiences. Consequently, critical delays in speech and      language development may occur.<br><br>
<li>Otitis media without infection presents a      special problem because symptoms of pain and      fever are usually not present. Therefore, weeks,      and even months, can go by before parents      suspect a problem. During this time, the child      may miss out on hearing the speech and      language needed for normal development.
</ul>


<H4>How can I tell if my child might have otitis  media?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Even if there is no pain or fever, there are other      signs you can look for that may indicate chronic      or recurring fluid in the ear: inattentiveness,      wanting the television or radio louder than      usual, misunderstanding directions, listlessness,      unexplained irritability, pulling or scratching the      ears.</ul>


<H4>What should I do if I think that otitis media      is causing a hearing, speech, or language      problem?</H4>

<ul>
<li>A physician should handle the medical treatment. Ear infections require immediate  attention, most likely from a pediatrician or      otolaryngologist (ear doctor). If your child has      frequently recurring infections and/or chronic  fluid in the middle ear, two additional specialists

should be consulted: an audiologist and a speech-language pathologist.<br><br>

     <li>An audiologist's evaluation will assess the severity of any hearing impairment, even in a very young or uncooperative child, and will indicate if a middle ear disorder is present.
<br><br>     
<li>A speech-language pathologist measures your
     child's specific speech and language skills and
     can recommend and/or provide remedial
     programs when they are needed.
</ul>

<H4>Will my physician refer my child for these   special evaluations?</H4>

<ul>
<li>As a parent, you are the best person to look for      signs that suggest poor hearing. The American      Academy of Pediatrics recognizes this when it      states, "Any child whose parent expresses      concern about whether the child hears should   be considered for referral for behavioral      audiometry without delay."
<br><br>
     <li>Parents should not be afraid to let their
     instincts guide them in requesting or
     independently arranging for further evaluation
     whenever they are concerned about their
     children's health or development.</ul>

    <H4> How can I find an audiologist or speech-
     language pathologist?</H4>

audiology and speech-language pathology in
     your state, write or call:

<H4>Pragmatic Language Tips</H4>

<p>There are several ways parents and teachers can help children use language appropriately in social situations. Social language use is known as pragmatics.</p>

<p>Some general suggestions are provided to help children develop skills in three major pragmatic areas. These areas were discussed in a previous edition of Let's Talk (January, 1990). Although suggestions are geared primarily for preschool children, they can be modified for use with older children as well.</p>

<H4>Use of Different Language Functions</H4>


<ul>
<li>Ask questions or make
     suggestions to help a child use language for different purposes:

<ul>
<li>Desired Language Function	
<li>Suggested 	Question or 	Comment
</ul>


<ul> <li>Comment "What did you do"'  or "Tell me about ... 

    <li> Request"Tell your friend . . ."  or  "What do you want?"

    <li> Question " Ask me . ." 
</ul>
<br>
<li> Respond to a child's intended   message rather than correcting    the pronunciation or grammar;      but provide an appropriate      model in your own speech. For   example, if a child says, "That's how it doesn't go," respond, "You're right. That's not how it goes."

<br><br>
<li> Take advantage of naturally occurring interactions to increase use of different language functions. For example, practice greetings at the beginning of a day; have children ask peers what they want to eat for snacks; have children request necessary materials to complete an art project.
</ul>


<H4>Adaptive Language Use</H4>

<ul>
<li>Role play conversations that might occur with different   people in different situations.      For example, set up a situation      (or use one that occurs during      the course of a day) in which a      child has to explain the same      thing to different people. For      instance, a child might be asked
to teach the rules of a new
     game to a younger child and to an adult. If the child's explanations are the same for each listener, model different language patterns for an adult and a child listener.
<br><br>



<li>Encourage use of effective persuasion. Ask children what they would say, for example, to convince their parents to let them do something. Discuss
different ways to present a message:

<ul>
<li>polite ("Please may I go to the party?") vs. impolite ("You better let me go.");

<li>indirect ("That music is loud.") vs. direct ("Turn off the radio.").
</ul>


Discuss why some requests would be more persuasive than others.

</ul>

<H4>Conversation and Narration Skills</H4>

<ul>
<li>Comment on a child's topic of      conversation before introducing      a new topic. Add related      information. This will help a      child say more about a      particular topic.
<br><br>
<li>Provide visual prompts such as      pictures, objects, or a story      outline to help a child tell a      story in sequence.
<br><br>
<li>Encourage a child to rephrase      or revise an unclear word or      sentence. Provide an appropriate      revision by asking "Did you      mean . .
<br><br>
<li>Show how nonverbal signals are      important to communication.      For example, talk about what      happens when a facial      expression does not match the      emotion expressed in a verbal      message, e.g., using angry      words while smiling.
</ul>

<p>Use of suggestions such as these will help foster appropriate pragmatic language skills with children who might otherwise be at a disadvantage during social interactions.</p>

 <H3>Definition of Traumatic Brain Injury</H3>
 
      <p>The regulations for Public Law 101-476, the Individuals with
 Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), formerly the Education of the
 Handicapped Act, now include Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) as a
 separate disability category. While children with TBI have always
 been eligible for special education and related services, it
 should be easier for them under this new category to receive the
 services to which they are entitled. </p>  
 
       <p>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is defined within the IDEA as
 an acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical
 force, resulting in total or partial functional disability or
 psychosocial impairment, or both, that adversely affects a
 child's educational performance.  The term applies to open and
 closed head injuries resulting in impairments in one or more
 areas, such as cognition; language; memory; attention; reasoning;
 abstract thinking; judgement; problem-solving; sensory,
 perceptual, and motor abilities; psychosocial behavior; physical
 functions; information processing; and speech. The term does not
 apply to brain injuries that are congenital or degenerative,
 or brain injuries induced by birth trauma. [(Code of Federal
 Regulations, Title 34, Section 300.7(b)(12)] </p>

<a name="Incidence"></a>
 
<H3> Incidence</H3>
 
     <p> TBI is the leading cause of death and disability in children
 and adolescents in the United States.  The most frequent causes
 of TBI are related to motor vehicle crashes, falls, sports, and
 abuse/assault.  More than one million children sustain head
 injuries annually; approximately 165,000 require hospitalization. 
 However, many students with mild brain injury may never see a
 health care professional at the time of the accident.</p>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
 
 <H3>Characteristics</H3>
 
      <p>The National Head Injury Foundation calls TBI "the silent
 epidemic," because many children have no visible impairments
 after a head injury.  Symptoms can vary greatly depending upon
 the extent and location of the brain injury.  However,
 impairments in one or more areas (such as cognitive functioning,
 physical abilities, communication, or social/behavioral
 disruption) are common.   These impairments may be either
 temporary or permanent in nature and may cause partial or total
 functional disability as well as psychosocial maladjustment.</p>
 
     <p> Children who sustain TBI may experience a complex array of
 problems, including the following:</p>   

<ul> 
     <li>Physical impairments - speech, vision, hearing and other
       sensory impairment, headaches, lack of fine motor     
       coordination, spasticity of muscles, paresis or paralysis 
       of one or both sides and seizure disorders,balance, and
       other gait impairments.<br><br>
 
    <li>Cognitive impairments - short- and long-term memory   
       deficits, impaired concentration, slowness of thinking, and
       limited attention span, as well as impairments of
       perception, communication, reading and writing skills,
       planning, sequencing, and judgement.<br><br>
 
    <li>Psychosocial-behavioral-emotional impairments - fatigue,
       mood swings, denial, self-centeredness,anxiety, depression,
       lowered self-esteem, sexual dysfunction, restlessness, lack
       of motivation, inability to self-monitor, difficulty with
       emotional control, inability to cope, agitation, excessive
       laughing or crying, and difficulty relating to others.
</ul>
 
   <p> Any or all of the above impairments may occur to different
 degrees.  The nature of the injury and its attendant problems can
 range from mild to severe, and the course of recovery is very
 difficult to predict for any given student. It is important to
 note that, with early and ongoing therapeutic intervention, the
 severity of these symptoms may decrease, but in varying degrees.</p>

<a name="Educational"></a> 

 <H3>Educational Implications</H3>
 
    <p>Despite its high incidence, many medical and education
 professionals are unaware of the consequences of childhood head
 injury.  Students with TBI are too often inappropriately
 classified as having learning disabilities, emotional
 disturbance, or mental retardation.  As a result, the needed
 educational and related services may not be provided within the
 special education program.  The designation of TBI as a separate
 category of disability signals that schools should provide
 children and youth with access to and funding for
 neuropsychological, speech and language, educational, and other
 evaluations necessary to provide the information needed for the
 development of an appropriate individualized educational program
 (IEP).</p> 
 
    <p>While the majority of children with TBI return to school,
 their educational and emotional needs are likely to be very
 different from they were prior to the injury.  Although children
 with TBI may seem to function much like children born with other
 handicapping conditions, it is important to recognize that the
 sudden onset of a severe disability resulting from trauma is very
 different.  Children with brain injuries can often remember how
 they were before the trauma, which can result in a constellation
 of emotional and psychosocial problems not usually present
 in children with congenital disabilities.  Further, the trauma
 impacts family, friends, and professionals who recall what the
 child was like prior to injury and who have difficulty in
 shifting and adjusting goals and expectations.</p>  
 
   <p> Therefore, careful planning for school re-entry (including
 establishing linkages between the trauma center/rehabilitation
 hospital and the special education team at the school) is
 extremely important in meeting the needs of the child.  It will
 be important to determine whether the child needs to relearn
 material previously known. Supervision may be needed (i.e.
 between the classroom and restroom) as the child may have
 difficulty with orientation.  Teachers should also be aware that,
 because the child's short-term memory may be impaired, what
 appears to have been learned may be forgotten later in the day. 
 To work constructively with students with TBI, educators may need
 to:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Provide repetition and consistency;<br><br> 
 
    <li>Demonstrate new tasks, state instructions, and provide
       examples to illustrate ideas and concepts;<br><br>
 
    <li>Avoid figurative language;<br><br>
 
    <li>Reinforce lengthening periods of attention to appropriate
        tasks;<br><br>
 
    <li>Probe skill acquisition frequently and provide repeated
        practice;<br><br>
 
    <li>Teach compensatory strategies for increasing memory;<br><br>
 
    <li>Be prepared for students' reduced stamina and increased
        fatigue and provide rest breaks as needed; and<br><br>
 
    <li>Keep the environment as distraction-free as possible.
</ul>
 
    <p>Initially, it may be important for teachers to gauge whether
 the child can follow one-step instructions well before
 challenging the child with a sequence of two or more directions. 
 Often attention is focused on the child's disabilities after the
 injury, which reduces self-esteem; therefore, it is important to
 build opportunities for success and to maximize the child's
 strengths.</p>

<H3>Definition</H3>
 
      <p>Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS (not
 otherwise specified) are  developmental disabilities that share
 many of the same characteristics.  Usually evident by age three,
 autism and PDD-NOS are neurological disorders that affect a
 child's ability to communicate, understand language, play, and
 relate to others.</p>
 
       <p>In the diagnostic manual used to classify disabilities, the
 DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), "autistic
 disorder" is listed as a category under the heading of "Pervasive
 Developmental Disorders."  A diagnosis of autistic disorder is
 made when an individual displays 6 or more of 12 symptoms listed
 across three major areas: social interaction, communication, and
 behavior.  When children display similar behaviors but do not
 meet the criteria for autistic disorder, they may receive a
 diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder NOS (PDD not
 otherwise specified).  Although the diagnosis is technically
 referred to as PDD-NOS, throughout the remainder of this fact
 sheet we will refer to it as PDD, as it is more commonly known.</p> 
 
      <p>Autistic disorder is one of the disabilities specifically
 defined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
 (IDEA), the federal legislation under which children and youth
 with disabilities receive special education and related services. 
 IDEA, which uses the term "autism," defines the disorder as "a
 developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and
 nonverbal communication and social interaction, usually evident
 before age 3, that adversely affects a child's educational
 performance.  Other characteristics associated with autism are
 engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements,
 resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines,
 and unusual responses to sensory experiences."  (In keeping with
 the IDEA and the way in which this disorder is generally referred
 to in the field, we will use the term autism throughout the
 remainder of this fact sheet.)</p>
 
     <p> Due to the similarity of behaviors associated with autism
 and PDD, use of the term pervasive developmental disorder has
 caused some confusion among parents and professionals.  However,
 the treatment and educational needs are similar for both
 diagnoses.</p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Incidence"></a>
<H3> Incidence</H3> 
 
      <p>Autism and PDD occur in approximately 5 to 15 per 10,000
 births.  These disorders are four times more common in boys than
 girls.</p>
 
      <p>The causes of autism and PDD are unknown.  Currently,
 researchers are investigating areas such as neurological damage
 and biochemical imbalance in the brain.  These disorders are not
 caused by psychological factors.</p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
 <H3>Characteristics</H3> 
 
      <p>Some or all of the following characteristics may be observed
 in mind to severe forms:</p>

      
<UL>
<LI>Communication problems (e.g., using and understanding    language);
<LI>Difficulty in relating to people, objects, and events;
<LI>Unusual play with toys and other objects;
<LI>Difficulty with changes in routine or familiar surroundings;  and
<li>Repetitive body movements or behavior patterns.
</UL>
 
     <p> Children with autism or PDD vary widely in abilities,
 intelligence, and behaviors.  Some children do not speak; others
 have limited language that often includes repeated phrases or
 conversations. People with more advanced language skills tend to
 use a small range of topics and have difficulty with abstract
 concepts.  Repetitive play skills, a limited range of interests,
 and impaired social skills are generally evident as well. 
 Unusual responses to sensory information -- for example, loud
 noises, lights, certain textures of food or fabrics -- are also
 common.</p>

<a name="Educational"></a> 
 <H3>Educational Implications</H3> 
 
     <p> Early diagnosis and appropriate educational programs are
 very important to children with autism or PDD.  Public Law
 101-476, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
 formerly the Education of the Handicapped Act, includes autism as
 a disability category.  From the age of three, children with
 autism and PDD are eligible for an educational program
 appropriate to their individual needs.  Educational programs for
 students with autism or PDD focus on improving communication,
 social, academic, behavioral, and daily living skills.  Behavior
 and communication problems that interfere with learning sometimes
 require the assistance of a knowledgeable professional in the
 autism field who develops and helps to implement a plan which can
 be carried out at home and school.</p>
 
     <p>The classroom environment should be structured so that the
 program is consistent and predictable.  Students with autism or
 PDD learn better and are less confused when information is
 presented visually as well as verbally.  Interaction with
 nondisabled peers is also important, for these students provide
 models of appropriate language, social, and behavior skills.  To
 overcome frequent problems in generalizing skills learned at
 school, it is very important to develop programs with parents, so
 that learning activities, experiences, and approaches can be
 carried over into the home and community.</p>
 
      <p>With educational programs designed to meet a student's
 individual needs and specialized adult support services in
 employment and living arrangements, children and adults with
 autism or PDD can live and work in the community.</p>

 <H3>Definition of Epilepsy</H3> 
 
     <p> According to the Epilepsy Foundation of America, epilepsy is
 a physical condition that occurs when there is a sudden, brief
 change in how the brain works.  When brain cells are not
 working properly, a person's consciousness, movement, or actions
 may be altered for a short time. These physical changes are
 called epileptic seizures.  Epilepsy is therefore sometimes
 called a seizure disorder.  Epilepsy affects people in all
 nations and of all races.</p>
 
     <p> Some people can experience a seizure and not have epilepsy. 
 For example, many young children have convulsions from fevers. 
 These febrile convulsions are one type of seizure.  Other
 types of seizures not classified as epilepsy include those caused
 by an imbalance of body fluids or chemicals or by alcohol or drug
 withdrawal.  A single seizure does not mean that the person
 has epilepsy.</p>

<a name="Incidence"></a>
<H3> Incidence</H3> 
 
      <p>About two million Americans have epilepsy; of the 125,000
 new cases that develop each year, up to 50% are in children and
 adolescents.</p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Characteristics"></a>
 <H3>Characteristics</H3> 
<p>Although the symptoms listed below are not necessarily
 indicators of epilepsy, it is wise to  consult a doctor if you or
 a member of your family experiences one or more of them:</p>
 
<UL>
<LI>"Blackouts" or periods of confused memory;
<LI>Episodes of staring or unexplained periods of unresponsiveness;
<LI>Involuntary movement of arms and legs;
<LI>"Fainting spells" with incontinence or followed by
 excessive fatigue; or
<LI>Odd sounds, distorted perceptions, episodic feelings of
fear that cannot be explained.
</UL>
 
<p>Seizures can be generalized, meaning that all brain cells
 are involved.  One type of generalized seizure consists of a
 convulsion with a complete loss of consciousness.  Another type
 looks like a brief period of fixed staring.</p>
 
<p> Seizures are partial when those brain cells not working
 properly are limited to one part of the brain.  Such partial
 seizures may cause periods of "automatic behavior" and altered
 consciousness.  This is typified by purposeful- looking behavior,
 such as buttoning or unbuttoning a shirt. Such behavior, however,
 is unconscious, may be repetitive, and is usually not recalled.</p>

<a name="Educational"></a> 
 <H3>Educational Implications</H3> 
 
<p>Students with epilepsy or seizure disorders are eligible for
 special education and related services under the Individuals with
 Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), formerly the Education
 of the Handicapped Act (Public Law 94-142).  Epilepsy is
 classified as "other health impaired" and an Individualized
 Education Program (IEP) would be developed to specify appropriate
 services.  Some students may have additional conditions such as
 learning disabilities along with the seizure disorders.</p>
 
<p>Seizures may interfere with the child's ability to learn. 
 If the student has the type of seizure characterized by a brief
 period of fixed staring, he or she may be missing parts of what
 the teacher is saying.  It is important that the teacher observe
 and document these episodes and report them promptly to parents
 and to school nurses.</p>
 
<p>Depending on the type of seizure or how often they occur,
 some children may need additional assistance to help them keep up
 with classmates.  Assistance can include adaptations
 in classroom instruction, first aid instruction on seizure
 management to the student's teachers, and counseling, all of
 which should be written in the IEP.</p>
 
<p>It is important that the teachers and school staff be
 informed about the child's condition,possible effects of
 medication, and what to do in case a seizure occurs at school. 
 Most parents find that a friendly conversation with the
 teacher(s) at the beginning of the school year is the best
 way to handle the situation.  Even if a child has seizures that
 are largely controlled by medication, it is still best to notify
 the school staff about the condition.</p>
 
<p>School personnel and the family should work together to
 monitor the effectiveness of medication as well as any side
 effects.  If a child's physical or intellectual skills seem to
 change, it is important to tell the doctor.  There may also be
 associated hearing or perception problems caused by the brain
 changes.  Written observations of both the family and school
 staff will be helpful in discussions with the child's doctor.</p>
 
<p> Children and youth with epilepsy must also deal with the
 psychological and social aspects of the condition.  These include
 public misperceptions and fear of seizures, uncertain occurrence,
 loss of self control during the seizure episode, and compliance
 with medications.  To help children feel more confident about
 themselves and accept their epilepsy, the school can assist by
 providing epilepsy education programs for staff and students,
 including information on seizure recognition and first aid.</p>
 
<p>Students can benefit the most when both the family and
 school are working together. There are many materials available
 for families and teachers so that they can understand how to
 work most effectively as a team.</p>

<h3> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>The ability to pay attention is an important prerequisite to success in
school. Any difficulty with attending skills can have an adverse effect
on learning. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) refers to
the approximately 1 in every 20 (3-5%) of school-age children who have
significant difficulty with attention. Although the specific cause of
ADHD is still unknown, research has indicated the possibility of a
genetic or other prenatal cause.<p>

<p>The terms used to identify these children have changed as knowledge of
the.disorder has increased. In the past, terms such as minimal brain
damage or minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), learning disability (LI), or
hyperactive or hyperkinetic were used depending on the child's major area
of difficulty. Today, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is used to
recognize the important relationship between attending skills and the
ability to learn.<p>

<p>ADHD is the term used when the primary characteristic is significant
inattentiveness and impulsivity with or without hyperactivity. The child
often fails to finish projects, seems not to listen, is easily
distracted, and has difficulty concentrating even on a chosen task. Other
thoughts. sights, or sounds keep getting in the way, especially when the
task is difficult
or uninteresting. The child acts before thinking, switches from activity
to activity, needs a lot of supervision, and has difficulty with
organization of time, work, and belongings.<p>

<p>Hyperactivity often occurs with inattentiveness and impulsivity. The
child has difficulty sitting still, fidgets excessively, has difficulty
staying seated, and moves about excessively even during sleep. Onset
occurs before the age of 7 years. Behaviors are chronic (present
throughout the child's life), pervasive (present throughout the child's
day), and are not due to other factors such as anxiety or depression.<p>

<p>Attention deficit disorder
residual type (ADDRET) is sometimes used to indicate residual attention
deficit disorder (ADD) in older adolescents who were
previously identified as ADHD at a younger age but who no longer exhibit
hyperactivity. Approximately 50% of those with ADHD will mature out of
ADHD at puberty.<p>

<p>ADHD is present in children with average ability and in those who are
gifted. It affects boys and girls, but is more prevalent in boys. Most
often, these children appear restless and fidgety, but some children
appear lethargic, shy, and withdrawn. They may shout out answers in class
or respond reluctantly after prodding by the teacher. Work is often
incomplete and disorganized. At times, some children appear to be in
their own little world and are often falsely accused of not trying hard
enough, of being lazy, or of just not caring.
Social and emotional problems are common. They may be rejected by their
peers. Academic difficulties, behavioral problems, low, self-esteem,
aggressiveness, and, at times depression may occur.</p>

<h3> <a name="ADHD and Learning Disabilities">ADHD and Learning
Disabilities</a></h3>

<p>ADHD and learning disabilities frequently occur together, however, they
are not the same. Learning disabilities include difficulty with
receiving, organizing,
understanding, remembering, and offering information.  ADHD involves
difficulty with paying attention to information. Between 10 and 20% of
all school-aged children have learning disabilities. of those with LD,
about 20 to 25% will also have ADHD.<p>

<h3> <a name="Identification">Identification</a></h3>
<p>
<p>Behavioral problems, poor
school work, and learning difficulties may be the first indicators of a
need for evaluation. Diagnosis is based on the history of the problem or
behavior, and whether it is chronic and pervasive. A complete evaluation
includes a
team review of the child's medical, psychological, educational, and
behavioral strengths and areas of difficulty by audiologists,
speech-language pathologists, pediatricians, psychologists. special
educators, psychiatrists, and neurologists.<p>
<p>

<hr>


<h3> <a name="Treatment">Treatment</a></h3>
<p>
 <p>Audiologists and speech -language pathologists are specialists in human
communication.
An audiologist should be consulted to measure hearing ability, evaluate
auditory skills, identify the presence and severity of any problem, and
provide appropriate recommendations. A speech- language pathologist
should be consulted to evaluate speech and language skills, identify
areas of strength and weakness in communication, and provide appropriate
recommendations and treatment, if indicated.<p>

<p>Medication (such as Toframil, Desipramine, Catapress, Tegretol,
Dexedrine, Ritalin, and Cylert) may be prescribed to control or treat
symptoms by a physician who is familiar with ADHD.<p>

<p>Educational interventions such
as accommodations within the regular education classroom (for example,
preferential seating in the classroom and elimination of distraction),
compensatory educational instruction (for example, repeating and
simplifying instructions, tutoring,  and use of a daily assignment
notebook), or placement in special education programs may be suggested.<p>

<p>Family and/or individual treatment may help to deal with aggression,
frustration, and disappointment, and feelings of failure in getting along
with family, school personnel, and peers.<p>

<p>Previous treatment approaches including food-additive-free diet,
elimination of sugar and megavitamin treatment have been found to be of
little value.<p>

<H4>What is language?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Language is a code that we learn to use in order to communicate ideas and 
express our wants and needs. Reading, writing, speaking, and some gesture 
systems are all forms of language.
</ul>

<H4>What makes up this language code?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Language is made up of a series of rules for:<br><br>
 
<ul>
<li>creating words or signs from smaller units like sounds, letters, or 
body movements<br><br>

<li>modifying the meaning of root words (e.g., girl + -s = girls, walk + -ed 
= walked, teach +   -er = teacher, quick + ly = quickly, dis- +   obey = 
disobey)<br><br>

<li>combining words together (the grammar of   the language)
attaching meaning to words<br><br>

<li>holding a conversation; telling a story; and   using different forms of 
language for different  listeners, purposes, and situations.
</ul>
</ul>

<H4>What is speech?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Speech is the spoken form of language.
</ul>

<H4>How do children learn all these language rules?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Children learn language and speech by listening to the language around them and practicing what they hear. In this way, they figure out the  rules of the language code. It is not learned all   at once but in stages over time.
</ul>

<H4>How can parents help a child learn to talk?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Talk to the child. Read to the child. Encourage the child to talk, but don't demand speech.      Make talking fun.
</ul>

<H4>How do you know that a child's language and      speech are what they 
should be for a particular   age?</H4>

<ul>
<li>There are expected language behaviors for different ages. For example, by 1 year of age a  child should use one or two words, 
follow simple requests ("Come here"), and understand simple questions ("Where's your shoe?"). By 2 - 3 years of age, the child 
should be using two or three word sentences to talk about and ask for things 
and following two requests ("Get the ball and put it on the table"), Parents 
should also understand their child's speech most of the time.
<br><br>
<li>Children are individuals and do develop at slower or faster rates than 
expected. What is most important is that the child shows continuous language growth.
</ul>

<H4>When should I seek professional help?</H4>

<ul>
<li>When you become concerned. Don't delay.      No child is too young to be 
helped. If there is  a problem, early attention is important. If   there is no 
problem, you will be relieved of  worry.
</ul>

<H4>Will hearing problems affect speech and language development?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Yes. The first years of life are particularly      important for learning speech 
and language.      Even mild hearing losses may cause children      to miss 
much of the speech and language      around them and result in critical 
developmental delays. Parents should make sure that      their children receive a regular hearing      evaluation from an audiologist certified by      the 
American Speech-Language-Hearing      Association (ASHA), particularly if 
there is a  history of ear infections, frequent colds or  other upper 
respiratory infections, or allergies.

</ul>

<H4>Are there ever other physical causes of   language disability?</H4>

<ul>
<li>There are, but most often language disability   exists without any known 
physical cause.
</ul>

<H4>How about other causes?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes children are not exposed to enough language to learn the rules. Sometimes the child has no need to talk because parents respond to pointing and gestures instead of speech. But most language disabilities occur without an identifiable cause.
</ul>

<H4>What can be done about language disabilities?</H4>

<ul>
<li>A speech-language pathologist with experience   in child development can evaluate the child's  language development, design an organized  plan of language learning, and carry out the  plan in individual or small group sessions.      Educated at the master's or doctoral  level, certified by ASHA, and licensed in  almost all states, this professional will also  help you help your child.
</ul>

<H4>Where can I find a speech-language  pathologist?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Speech-language pathologists provide services  in schools, colleges and universities, hospitals,   clinics, private practices, and other settings. To      find a speech-language pathologist near you, write or call ASHA.
</ul>

<H4>What is articulation?</H4> 	

<ul><li>Articulation is the process by which sounds, syllables, 	and words are formed when your tongue, jaw, teeth, lips, and  palate alter the air stream coming from the 	vocal folds.
</ul>  

<H4>What is an  articulation problem?</H4>
 
<ul><li>A person has an articulation problem when 
he or she produces sounds, syllables. or words incorrectly so that listeners 
do not understand what is being said or pay more attention to the way 
the words sound than to what they mean. 
</ul>

<H4>Is an articulation problem 
the same as "baby talk"?</H4> 

<ul><li>An articulation problem sometimes sounds 
like baby 	talk because many very young children do 	mispronounce 
sounds, syllables, and words. But words that sound cute when 
mispronounced by  young children interfere with the communication 
of 	older children or adults. Older children and adults 	have so many 
severe errors that their articulation 	problems are very different from "baby 
talk."
</ul>

<H4>What are some types of sound errors?</H4>

<ul><li>Most errors fall into one of three categories-
     omissions, substitutions, or distortions. An example   of an omission is 
"at" for "hat" or "oo" for "shoe."      An example of a substitution is the use of 
"w" for      "r." which makes "rabbit" sound like "wabbit," or      the 
substitution of "th" for "s" so that "sun" is      pronounced "thun." When the 
sound is said      inaccurately, but sounds something like the intended      
sound, it is called a distortion.
</ul>

<H4>What causes an articulation problem?</H4>

<ul><li>Articulation problems may result from physical      handicaps, such as 
cerebral palsy, cleft palate. or      hearing loss, or may be related to other 
problems in      the mouth, such as dental problems. However, most      
articulation problems occur in the absence of any   obvious physical 
disability. The cause of these so-called functional articulation problems may be faulty      learning of speech 
sounds.
</ul>

<H4>Is an accent an articulation problem?</H4>

<ul><li>It can be for some persons. We all have accents-
Southern, Eastern, Northern, Western, Chicago,
Pittsburgh, Brooklyn, or Boston. An accent may be a problem if it interferes with a person's goals in life.
</ul>

<H4>Can ear problems during infancy have any effect on
     late sound development?</H4>

<ul><li>Children learn their speech sounds by listening to the      speech around  them. This learning begins very early      in life. If children have frequent ear  problems during   this important listening period. they may fail to learn      some speech sounds.
</ul>

<H4>Will a child outgrow a functional articulation problem?</H4>

<ul><li>A child's overall speech pattern will usually become    more understandable as he or she matures. but   some children will need direct 
training to eliminate all   articulation errors. The exact speech pattern of the      
individual child will determine the answer to this      question.
</ul>

<H4>Do children learn all sounds at once?</H4>

<ul><li>Sounds are learned in an orderly sequence. Some sounds, such as "p," 
"m," and "b," are learned as early as 3 years of age. Other sounds, like "s," 
"r,' and "l," often are not completely mastered until the early school years.
<br><br>
<li>At what age should a child be producing all sounds correctly?
Children should make all the sounds of English by 8   years of age. Many 
children learn these sounds much   earlier.
</ul>

<H4>How can I help a child pronounce words correctly?</H4>

<ul><li>By setting a good example. Don't interrupt or      constantly correct the 
child. Don't let anyone tease      or mock (including friends or relatives). 
Instead,  present a good model. Use the misarticulated word      correctly 
with emphasis. If the child says, "That's a      big wabbit," you say "Yes, that is a 
big rabbit. A big  white rabbit. Would you like to have a rabbit?"
</ul>

<H4>Can an adult with an articulation problem be helped?</H4>

<ul><li>As most articulation problems can be helped regardless of a person's age, but 
the longer the problem persists, the harder it is to change. Some problems.
such as those relating to nerve impulses to the muscles of articulation (dysarthria), are particularly difficult and generally will require a longer period of help than a functional disorder. Other conditions that may influence progress in a child or adult include hearing ability, condition of the oral structures such as the teeth, frequency of help obtained, motivation, intelligence, and cooperation.
</ul>

<H4>Who can help?</H4>

<ul><li>Contact a speech-language pathologist if you are      concerned about speech. A speech-language   pathologist is a professional trained at the master's or      doctoral level to evaluate and help the child or adult   with an articulation problem as well as other speech  and/or language disorders. The speech-language      pathologist should be certified by the American      Speech-Language-Hearing Association and/or      licensed by your state. The speech-language      pathologist can advise whether professional help is      indicated and how to arrange for assistance. The      speech-language pathologist can also give you      guidance or provide services to help prevent or      eliminate a problem. Early help is especially  important for more severe problems.
</ul>

<H4>Is it important to correct an articulation problem?</H4>

<ul><li>When you consider the possible impact an   articulation problem may have on one's social,   emotional, educational, and/or vocational status, the      answer becomes obvious. Our speech is an   important part of us. The quality of our lives is    affected by the adequacy of our speech.<BR><BR>

<H4>What is stuttering?</H4>

<ul><li>Stuttering is the condition in which the flow of speech is broken by abnormal stoppages (no sound), repetitions (st-st-stuttering), or prolongations (ssssstuttering) of sounds and syllables. There may also be unusual facial and body movements associated with the effort to speak.
</ul>


<H4>Aren't all people nonfluent to some extent?</H4>

<ul><li>Yes. Almost all children go through a      stage of frequent nonfluency in early      speech development. Adults may interject syllables ("uh") and occasionally      repeat words, phrases and sounds,      but these nonfluencies are accepted as      normal and usually are not a cause for      concern.
</ul>
<H4>Does stammering mean the same thing  as stuttering?</H4>

<ul><li>Most people use the terms
     interchangeably.
</ul>

<H4>What causes stuttering?</H4>

<ul><li>We still do not know for a fact what      causes stuttering. It may have different      causes in different people, or it may occur only when a combination of factors      comes together. It is also quite possible      that what causes stuttering is quite different from what makes it continue or      get worse. Possible influences include      incoordination of the speech muscles;      rate of language development; the way      parents and others talk to the child; and      other forms of communication and life      stress.
</ul>

<H4>Is stuttering caused by emotional or  psychological problems?</H4>

<ul><li>Children who stutter are no more likely      to have psychological problems than      children who do not stutter. In general,      there is no reason to believe that emotional trauma causes stuttering.
</ul>


<H4>At what age is stuttering likely to appear?</H4>

<ul><li>Stuttering typically begins at a very early age (usually between 2 and 5 years),      but will occasionally appear for the first      time in a school-age child and, more      rarely, in an adult.
</ul>

<H4>If I think my child is beginning to stutter, should I wait or seek help?</H4>

<ul><li>You should seek a professional evaluation as soon as you become concerned.      Most children outgrow their nonfluency,      but others will not. The problem of stuttering may be prevented from developing if treated early enough.
</ul>

<H4>Once stuttering has developed, can it be treated?</H4>

<ul><li>Yes, there are a variety of successful approaches for treating both children and      adults. There are no published scientific      data that indicate the general superiority of any one of these approaches.
</ul>

<H4>Can stuttering be "cured"?</H4>

<ul><li>It is best to avoid thinking in terms of an absolute "cure" for stuttering. Stuttering is not a disease. The goal should be to progress toward improved fluency  and success in communicating.
</ul>

<H4>What should I do when I hear a child speaking nonfluently?</H4>	


<ul><li>Children may be unaware that they are 	speaking nonfluently. Do not call attention to the nonfluent speech pattern. <br><br> 	

<li>Do not say "Stop and start over," 		"Think before you talk," "Talk slower," 		or "Cat got your tongue?" Listen patiently and carefully to what the child is 		saying, and do not focus on how it is 		being said.  	
</ul>

<H4>What should I do when I hear an adult stuttering?</H4>  	

<ul><li>Adults who stutter need the same patience and attention to their ideas as 		speakers who don't stutter. Don't look 		away and don't hurry them or fill in 		words. This attempt to help can create 		anxiety and self-consciousness and 		make the problem worse.  
</ul>

<H4>Who can help with this problem?</H4>  

<ul><li>A speech-language pathologist who has had experience in dealing with the stuttering problems of children and adults. The speech-language pathologist is the professional who is trained at the master's or doctoral degree level to evaluate the person who stutters and prepare a plan to improve speech.<br><br>

<li>Speech-language pathologists hold the Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) from the American Speech- Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and/or a license from your state.<BR><BR>

<ul>
<li>Why is speech-language treatment needed? My baby doesn't talk yet!<br><br>

<li>That's just "baby-talk". I'm sure my child will outgrow it.<br><br>

<li>Everyone in our family was a late talker.  My child will talk when the time is right.<br><br>

<li>Why worry now? Speech and language services will be available when school starts.<br><br>

<li>Treatment? Looks like they are just playing games to me.
</ul>

<p>You may have had similar thoughts or comments. Usually, there is concern 
about a child's speech and language skills if there is no speech by the age of 1 
year, if speech is not clear, or if speech or language is different from that of 
other children of the same age.</p>

<H4>What is Early Identification?</H4> 

<p>It is estimated that 2% of all children born each year will have a disabling condition. Many of these children will have  speech and or language delays and disorders that may have a significant effect  on personal,  social,  academic, or vocational life. Although some children will  develop normal speech and language skills without treatment by the time  they enter school,  it is important to identify those who will not.
</p>

<p>Many people falsely believe that speech-language treatment cannot and 
should not begin until a child begins to talk. Yet research has shown that 
children know a great deal about their language even before the first word is said.  For example, children can distinguish between 
their native language and a foreign language, use different nonverbal 
utterances to express different needs, and imitate different patterns of speech  through babbling. </p>

<p>Early identification includes the evaluation and treatment provided to 
families and their children under  3 years old who have, or are at risk for 
having, a disability, or delay in speech, language or hearing. A child can 
quickly fall behind if speech and language learning is delayed. Early 
identification increases the chances  for improving communication skills.</p>

<H4>Who Should be Evaluated?</H4>

<p>Children identified as at-risk or high-risk, such as those from neonatal 
intensive care (NICU) units, should be tested early and at regular intervals. 
Other risk factors include diagnosed medical conditions, for example, chronic 
ear infections; biological factors, for example. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; genetic  defects, for example Down syndrome:   neurological defects, for example. cerebral palsy; or developmental disorders, for example, delayed language.</p>

<p>Children with no high-risk features should be evaluated if their speech and 
language is not similar to other children of the same age.</p>

<H4>How is the Evaluation Done?</H4>

<p>Evaluation may be formal or informal and include any combination of standardized tests; direct observation of play and interaction with caregivers; report by parent, 
teacher, or physician; and collection and detailed analysis of spontaneous 
speech samples.</p>

<p>Several sessions as well as ongoing evaluation may be required to obtain 
enough information to make an accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p>The early identification team may consist of the speech-language pathologist, 
audiologist, psychologist, neurologist, 
electrophysiologist, otolaryngologist,  pediatrician, nurse, and social
worker. Because speech-language delays and disorders may be due to a variety 
of causes, each professional makes valuable contributions to the evaluation.</p>

<H4>What is Speech-Language Treatment?</H4>

<p>From the results of the evaluation, certain services may be recommended. Prevention includes those  children who have been identified as at-risk, for example, due to low  birthweight, for a communication delay or disorder.</p>

<p>Services are provided 
before a specific diagnosis has been made. Remediation increases function in 
areas identified as delayed or disabling and may serve to prevent other related 
problems. For example, remediation of a language disorder can help to offset 
learning difficulties. Compensation enables the child and the family to make 
adjustments for limitations, as in some cases of cerebral palsy.</p>

<p>Language is taught in a natural
setting. It is presented at the child's developmental level; responses are 
consistently stimulated; and output is rewarded. Play may be used to teach 
communication, language models or rules of conversation, such as turn 
taking.</p>

<p>Feeding and swallowing
treatment may be needed to sustain life. It can also be used to encourage 
speech-like movements, stimulate sound production, or increase the child's 
awareness of speech movements.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about a possible speech-language delay or disability, 
consult a speech-language pathologist. <STRONG>A list of certified speech-language 
pathologists in your area may be obtained by calling the American Speech-
Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA) toll-free HELPLINE at 1-800-638-
8255.</STRONG></p>

<p>
The HEATH Resource Center has recently received a number of requests for 
information on issues associated with postsecondary education for 
individuals with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  In order to collect 
information on this emerging topic, the HEATH staff contacted Chesapeake 
Psychological Services, one of several Washington, DC metropolitan area 
resources offering comprehensive testing and follow-up support to 
individuals with varying types of disabilities.  Chesapeake Psychological 
Services has an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Clinic, which offers 
a full range of treatment services - from educational recommendations to 
consultation with physicians. As a result of that contact, Dr. Susan Biggs and 
Dr. Kathleen Nadeau on staff at Chesapeake Psychological Services accepted 
the invitation to present a professional development program to the 
members of  the Nation's Capital Area Disability Support Services Coalition.  
What follows is a summary of the Biggs-Nadeau presentation in December 
1992. </p>

<a name="Defining"></a>
<H3>Defining ADD</H3>
<p>
The basic characteristics of adults with ADD include inattention and 
impulsivity.  Adults with ADD may be disorganized, may lose things 
frequently, and may be easily distracted from the task-at-hand.  Impulsiveness  may include a perceived need to move on immediately to a new task, thus  leaving another unfinished (they may be enthusiastic beginners but poor  completers); impatience in waiting situations, such as in stalled traffic or  standing in a slow-moving line;  a short temper; or the tendency to respond  poorly to stress and thus become easily hassled. </p>

<p>The education community divides ADD, by definition, into two similar yet 
slightly different groups.  Individuals may be defined as having either ADD 
- Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder, or attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity.  Adults with ADD 
or ADHD may be either slow and lethargic, or restless and fidgety.  Medical 
researchers now believe that differences in chemistry in the parts of the brain  which control inhibition may cause ADD, and may be inherited.</p>

<hr>

<a name="Historical"></a>
<H3>Historical Trends</H3>
<p>Medical and educational researchers over the past century have addressed 
various aspects of attention-related disability.  In the early 1900's,  attention- related patterns and behavior problems following brain injury were the focus  of research.  During the 1930's and 1940's, attention-related characteristics  among individuals who had not sustained brain injury or brain damage were  recognized and studied.  Our knowledge became much more defined in the  1960's, with the awareness of some of the components that play a part in an attention-related disability, such as learning disabilities, neurologic dysfunction, or behavioral symptoms.  More precision regarding the 
definition of behavioral characteristics became possible in the 1970's.  Finally,  in the 1980's, the definition of ADD was included in the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of the Mental Disorders (DSM-III).  The DSM-III is the 
official glossary of descriptions of mental health diagnosis.  The addition of 
ADD to the DSM-III led to wide recognition of it as a specific disorder.
</p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="ADD"></a>
<H3>ADD and Adults</H3>
<p>
It is becoming clear that ADD is not a disability limited to childhood or 
adolescence.  More and more adults are discovering that they have ADD; 
current estimates are that between eight and 15 million American adults 
have the disability.  It is a high frequency and low visibility disability, 
meaning that many individuals have the disability, but its characteristics are 
not readily apparent. </p>
<p>
Some report that between one-third and one-half of children with ADD grow 
up to be adults with ADD.  While adults may be more likely to have an 
attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity, the adult will likely continue 
to experience difficulties with concentration; achieving his or her potential; 
impulsivity; behavior problems at home, school, or work; or will use poor 
judgment or have self-destructive tendencies.  Adults with ADD often 
present additional diagnoses as well, such as mild chronic depression, mood 
and energy swings, nervousness, sleep disorders, muscular tension, and/or 
learning disabilities. </p>

<p>The presence within a person of an ADD is pervasive.  It is more likely to 
affect many, or all, of an individual's life areas, rather than just one isolated 
area.  As a result, adults with ADD may experience difficulties with most life 
issues.  Some adults may be unable to complete formal education or may do 
so only with overwhelming drive.  Others may have trouble with 
interpersonal relationships.  Career problems may be present for others with 
ADD.  Career-related problems may stem from frequent job terminations 
because of poor job performance, attention and/or organization problems, 
interpersonal problems with supervisors and/or co-workers, or becoming 
easily bored and quitting a job.  Regardless of the life area in which  an adult 
with ADD is experiencing difficulties, each is likely to feel that he or she is not 
living up to his or her potential.  For relief, some may turn to intense 
physical or mental activity; others may use drugs or alcohol for self-
medication.

<a name="Diagnosis"></a>
<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
<p>Psycho-educational  diagnosticians use a system similar to the six steps 
described below when evaluating for ADD or ADHD. </p>
  
<ol><li><h4>Understanding Current Concerns and History</h4> 
<p>Diagnosticians interview the student, and possibly his or her family in order 
to garner as much information as possible.  Given the field's emerging 
knowledge about heredity and ADD, a diagnostician may look for clues to 
indicate if characteristics were present early in an individual's life, regardless 
of whether or not the individual and/or his or her family were identified as 
having any of the characteristics of this disability. </p>

<p>Some diagnosticians develop a questionnaire, such as one described by Biggs 
and Nadeau, during this phase of the evaluation process to elicit information 
about ADD or ADHD.  Such questions as "Do you feel that you are 
organized?", or "Would you describe for me your method of organization?" 
begin to provide diagnosticians with useful insights.  Throughout the 
individual's responses, the diagnostician looks for evidence that ADD 
characteristics seem to be present in situations both in and out of the school 
or campus environment.  Questions are asked to discover the areas affected by 
ADD including reading and writing skills, mathematics, attention and 
concentration abilities, language processing, visual and spatial abilities, 
memory, processing speed, social skills, and general concerns. </p>

<li><h4>Selecting Appropriate Measures to Address Concerns</h4>
<p>Diagnosticians select tests from a large inventory of assessment tools.  The  selection is based on questions raised from the client's history.  For example,  during the evaluation process, a diagnostician may administer tests which 
will produce information about the possibilities of ADD or ADHD, learning 
disabilities, emotional problems, and/or neurological issues. </p>

<li><h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
Since each individual is unique, there is no pre-determined number of tests 
that a psychlogist or psychiatrist may administer in order to assess for ADD or 
ADHD.  
The assessments usually cover the following areas: intelligence, 
cognitive/information processing, personality, and educational - if learning 
disability is suspected. </p>

<li><h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>
During this stage of the evaluation process, the diagnosticians "play 
detective" and "put clues together." </P>
  
<li><h4>Treatment Planning Conference</h4>
<p>
The treatment planning conference always includes the diagnostician and the 
student, but may also include parents, spouse, and/or an educational 
specialist.  In the conference, test results are shared and interpreted and 
recommendations are discussed.  These may include specific 
recommendations to the student regarding study skills, and 
recommendations to the college regarding needed supports and 
accommodations.  It may include recommendations for a medication 
evaluation, for psychological counseling, and/or for tutoring.  School 
placement issues may be discussed if the student is not satisfied with his or 
her current school.  For a working adult, both school and career issues may be 
discussed. </p>

<li><h4>Written Report</h4>
<p>
The diagnostician completes a full written report, including sections that list 
the tests which were given and the scores obtained, the interpretation of those 
scores, and individualized educational recommendations based on the 
students strengths and weaknesses.  Students should review the report 
thoroughly and ask any questions that they may have, or ask for the 
diagnostician to go over the report with them.  Most diagnosticians will 
schedule a follow-up appointment with the student, after he or she has 
received the written report and has had a chance to review it.  It is extremely 
important that the student understand the full contents of the report, as such 
an understanding will help the student advocate for his or her future needs.  
In addition, students should always keep a copy of the report, as well as any 
other relevant information, for their personal reference or future need. </p>
</ol>

<p>Costs of thorough evaluations, such as the six-step process described above, do 
vary and students are encouraged to become familiar with all options 
available to them before making a final choice.  Students should also check 
with their health insurance companies to see if such an evaluation is covered 
under their policy.</p>

<a name="Relevance"></a>
<H3>Relevance to Campus Disability Support Services</H3>
<p>College Offices for Disability Support Services are likely to see an increase in 
requests for services for students with ADD or ADHD.  The disability is now 
recognized in the K-12 school system and public awareness about it has been 
raised by popular media. Accommodations commonly provided by colleges 
and universities, based on the student's functional limitations, include 
extending time to complete exams or papers; using notetakers, tutors, or 
organizational supports; carrying reduced courseloads; and preferential 
registration for smaller classes. </p>

<li><p>ADD and the College Student -A Guide for High School and College 
Students with Attention Deficit Disorder (1994), by Patricia O. Quinn, M.D. 
(editor), is a 113-page compilation of user-friendly information. While ADD 
and the College Student begins by stating that it has been written for high 
school juniors and seniors and college students with attention deficit disorder  (ADD), a diverse audience can benefit from the collection of easy-to-read 
practical advice, including adults who suspect that they may have ADD, 
family members of individuals with ADD, postsecondary service providers, 
psychologists, diagnosticians, vocational rehabilitation workers, as well as 
high school teachers and college counselors. <br><br>
The first half of this 12-chapter book answers commonly asked quesitons, lists 
the major symptoms of ADD, and contains a checklist that can be used to help 
evaluate various symptoms, gain self-awareness, and provide guidance 
regarding the necessity of seeking a professional assessment. The 
biochemistry of ADD, medication, and other treatments for ADD also are 
covered. While Dr. Quinn states that she cannot endorse any of the 
alternative therapies at this point in time, she explains the basics of 
biofeedback therapy, self-control or cognitive therapy, and diet and 
megavitamin therapy. How ADD Affects You focuses on the most common 
issues faced by adolescents with ADD, both academic and social, and ends 
with personal commentaries from two college students with ADD. <br><br>

The second half of ADD and the College Student begins with Preparing for 
College: A Mother's Perspective. This personal story concludes with helpful 
hints for college students with ADD and for their parents. The remainder of 
the book leads readers through senior year at high school, college programs, 
and accommodations for students with ADD. The support services that 
postsecondary students with ADD may find helpful are described. Dr. Quinn 
points out that students can best understand which support services may be 
most helpful to them only after they understand their own learning strengths 
and weaknesses. She discusses common academic and emotional difficulties 
and then goes on to offer suggested accommodations. Quinn explains the 
three major sources from which the rights of college students with ADD 
stem: the Constitution, statues and regulations that prohibit discrimination, 
and cases decided by the courts. ADD and the College Student concludes with 
Commonly Asked Questions, which cover medicaiton, treatment programs, 
college admission and SAT's, parent involvement, learning 
accommodations, and legal issues. References to other relevant publications 
and organizations also are provided, as are the definitions of ADHD 
(Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder) used by both the American 
Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
ADD and the College Student is available from MAGINATION PRESS, 19 
Union Square West, New York, NY 10003. (800) 825-3089. The cost is $13.95, 
plus a shipping and handling fee of $2.75.

</p>

<li><p>Approaching College for the Student with ADD is one in a series of videos 
that seeks to inform students with ADD and their parents about the paths to 
success in college. In Approaching College for the Student with ADD, Dr. 
Patricia Quinn dispels the myth that ADD students could do better in school if 
only they tried harder. Quinn argues that many of these students already are 
putting considerable effort into their studies, and that for student with ADD, 
they key to success lies in developing and putting into practice strategies for 
time management, considering medication options, and continuing to seek 
supportive services. In the video, Quinn cautions students that the transition 
from high school and home to college involves enough major changes 
without making a clean break from medication or deciding to "turn over a 
new leaf" by attempting to handle course work without support services. 
Comments from Quinn are augmented by the remarks of several students 
with ADD, whose advice lends a "front  lines" pragmatism to the video. 
These students recount experiences with teachers and administrators and 
offer suggestions for effectively discussing the need for special 
accommodations. </p>

<li><p>In ADD and the College Student, another video in the series, Quinn provides 
a comprehensive list of personality traits associated with attention deficit 
disorder. For someone recently diagnosed with ADD, or for someone who 
suspects the presence of ADD, Quinn's overview of the disability is 
particularly informative. Her description of the disability emphasizes the 
increased tasks and responsibilities of personal care and academic workload 
that are associated with college life. Quinn's assessment provides a positive 
framework for understanding the disability and for developing strategies for 
the college student with ADD. <br><br>
Ann McCormick, an advisor at the American University (Washington, DC), 
follows Dr. Quinn's discussion of symptoms with examples of 
accommodations that her office commonly employs in providing for the 
needs of students with ADD. McCormick provides practical advice on 
choosing a college, and her presentation on accommodations is helpful in 
that it prepares a student with ADD for the kind of dialogue that must take 
place for an effective accommodation program to be developed. This 
discussion includes pragmatic strategies that a student with ADD can employ 
to improve his or her chances of succeeding in a college environment.
The cost of each video is $29.95. To order, prepay the Pediatric Development

<li><p>The ABC's of ADD (1993) is a 30-minute videotape that contains basic 
information for adults with ADD, those who suspect they have ADD, family 
members of individuals with ADD, or any of the many professionals who 
may be interested in the issues associated with adults with ADD. The adult 
focus of the video is conveyed from the start of the tape, which begins with 
snippets of personal stories told by three young adults with ADD and 
segments from various professionals speaking to an audience at an earlier 
conference. <br><br>
Each section is brief, conveying basic information. First, the primary 
symptoms of ADD, including some of the most characteristic symptoms of 
both children and adults with ADD, are discussed. The video expands upon 
this discussion by presenting characteristic secondary symptoms of 
individuals with ADD. Each of the medications most commonly prescribed to 
individuals with ADD is discussed briefly and some of the common side-
effects of the various medications are mentioned. The young adults with 
ADD who appeared at the beginning of the video tell longer versions of their 
own personal stories, touching on issues associated with postsecondary 
education and employment. Common characteristics of adults with ADD also 
are presented in a personal story format. A section on legal rights concludes 
the tape, briefly laying a foundation for understanding the legislation that has 
helped prevent discrimination against individuals with disabilities.
The ABC's of ADD is available from JKL Communications, P.O. Box 41057, 
Washington, DC 20016. The cost is $29.

<p>HEATH provides the following as a service to readers who write 
papers, present conference sessions, apply for funds, address public 
policy makers, and otherwise need to "make a case" concerning the 
education after high school of students with disabilities.  You may 
quote exactly what is stated here and cite the sources as noted under 
the facts, or obtain the sources and select the statistics you need.  
Readers are welcome to call HEATH and talk about these data to

<H3>College Freshmen with Disabilities</H3>

<ul>
<li>The percentage of first-time, full-time freshmen reporting 
disabilities has increased significantly since the later 1970s.  In 1991, 
8.8 percent of all freshmen reported having some types of disability, 
compared with 2.6 percent in 1978.

<li>Sight and learning disabilities were identified most frequently 
by freshmen with disabilities in 1991, with about 25 percent 
reporting each type.  (Chart not available in on-line version)

<li>The proportion of freshmen with disabilities citing learning 
disabilities increased from 15 percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 1991.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to be male and 
older than non-disabled students.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities expected to take longer than the 
normal time to complete their degrees and were more likely to select 
a college based on its special program offerings.

<li>Women were more likely than men to have sight and health-related disabilities and need math and science tutoring.

<li>Freshmen with orthopedic disabilities tended to be older than 
other disabled students and more likely to have finished high school 
some years before entering college or to have passed the GED exam.

<li>Freshmen with learning disabilities were most likely to be 
enrolled in two-year campuses (59 percent), while another two-fifths 
(40 percent) were enrolled at universities and four-year colleges.  
One percent were enrolled at historically black colleges and 
universities.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities who were enrolled in historically 
black colleges and universities were more likely to report being blind 
or partially sighted, or having a health related disability.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to come from 
lower-income families and less likely to have received financial 
assistance from their families than non-disabled students.  In 
addition, disabled freshmen were less likely to contribute savings  
from summer work the previous summer.  Both disabled and non-
disabled received help from federal financial aid programs, private 
grants, and institutionally financed college loans.

<li>Across most major fields of study, disabled and other students 
expressed similar expectations.  Where they differed: students with 
disabilities were more interested in technical fields than their non-
disabled peers and less interested in being business majors.

<a name="Basis"></a>
<H3>Basis of exit for high school students, 1989-90</H3>

<ul>
<li>Over 220,000 students with disabilities left the special 
education system in 1989-90.

<li>More than four in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a diploma.

<li>More than one in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a certificate.

<li>One quarter of the students with disabilities, age 14 or older, 
dropped out of high school before completion.

<li>Students with specific learning disabilities represent the 
largest (129,000) number of the "exiting" population.  Slightly more 
than half of them (52%) were reported to have earned diplomas.  
Other groups in which more than half of the departing students 
obtained diplomas were those with visual impairment (61%), deaf-
blindness (61%), hearing impairment (59%), and orthopedic 
impairment (58%)

<a name="National"></a>
<H3>National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education 
Students</H3>

<p>The following data are taken from the National Longitudinal 
Transition Study of Special Education Students, conducted by SRI 
International under contract with the Office of Special Education 
Programs within the U.S. Department of Education.  The SRI data are 
based on a sample of over 8,000 special education students aged 13 
to 23 between the years 1987 to 1989.  Data was first collected in 
1987 from parent interviews, contacts with educators, and 
information from the students' school records.  Data collection was 
repeated in 1990 to track changes in experiences over time.  The 
data below highlight some of the changes in the area of participation 
in postsecondary education. </p>

<H4>Postsecondary education participation </H4>

<ul>
<li>Within the first two years after exiting high school, 15% of students 
with disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 27% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li> Comparatively, two years after leaving school, 56% of students 
without disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 68% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li>Thus, many disabled and non-disabled students alike who did not 
enroll in postsecondary education immediately after high school, do 
attend at a future date.  For both students with and without 
disabilities, enrollment rates are 12% higher three to five years after 
high school than they were two years after high school.  Students 
with disabilities are almost twice as likely to enroll in postsecondary 
education three to five years after high school as they are two years 
after high school.  However, there is still a gap in enrollment rates 
between students with disabilities and students without disabilities; 
at both time intervals, students with disabilities enroll in 
postsecondary education at significantly lower rates than do students 
without disabilities.
</ul>

<H4>Enrollment trends by disability category</H4>

<ul>
<li>Among the different disability categories, there is a great deal of 
variation in postsecondary education participation rates.  

<li>Two years after leaving high school, the participation rates for 
students who are deaf were the highest (36.4); the next largest rates 
were for students with speech impairments (34.0); and students with 
visual impairments (33.0).

<li>Three to five years after leaving high school, the participation rates 
in postsecondary education were the highest for students who are 
hard of hearing (60.4); the next highest rates were for students who 
are deaf (60.0); and students with visual impairments (57.0).

<li>Of all students with disabilities, students with sensory impairments 
attend postsecondary education at rates most similar to students 
without disabilities.

<h3> <a name="Foreword">Foreword </a></h3>
<p>
     "Why?"<p>
<p>
     This is the question we parents are always trying to
answer. It's good that children ask questions: that's the best
way to learn. All children have two wonderful resources for
learning--imagination and curiosity. As a parent, you can
awaken your children to the joy of learning by encouraging
their imagination and curiosity.<p>
<p>
     Helping Your Child Learn to Read is one in a series of
books on different education topics intended to help you make
the most of your child's natural curiosity. Teaching and
learning are not mysteries that can only happen in school. They
also happen when parents and children do simple things
together.<p>
<p>
     For instance, you and your child can: sort the socks on
laundry day-sorting is a major function in math and science;
cook a meal together-cooking involves not only math and science
but good health as well; tell and read each other
stories--storytelling is the basis for reading and writing (and
a story about the past is also history); or play a game of
hopscotch together playing physical games will help your child
learn to count and start on a road to lifelong fitness.<p>
<p>
     By doing things together, you will show that learning is
fun and important. You will be encouraging your child to study,
learn, and stay in school.<p>
<p>
     All of the books in this series tie in with the National
Education Goals set by the President and the Governors, The
goals state that, by the year 2000: every child will start
school ready to learn; at least 90 percent of all students will
graduate from high school; each American student will leave the
4th, 8th, and 12th grades demonstrating competence in core
subjects; U.S. students will be first in the world in math and
science achievement; every American adult will be literate,
will have the skills necessary to compete in a global economy,
and will be able to exercise the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship; and American schools will be liberated from drugs
and violence so they can focus on learning.<p>
<p>
     This book is a way for you to help meet these goals. It
will give you a short rundown on facts, but the biggest part of
the book is made up of simple, fun activities for you and your
child to do together. Your child may even beg you to do them.
At the end of the book is a list of resources, so you can
continue the fun.<p>
<p>
     Let's get started. We invite you to find an activity in
this book and try it.<p>
<p>

<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     When parents help their children lean to read, they help
open the door to a new world. As a parent, you can begin an
endless learning chain: You read to your children, they develop
a love of stories and poems, they want to read on their own,
they practice reading, and finally they read for their own
information or pleasure. They become readers, and their world
is forever expanded and enriched.<p>
<p>
     This book focuses primarily on what you can do to help
children up to 10 years of age. During these years you can lay
the foundation for your child to become a lifelong reader. In
the first section, you will find some basic information about
reading to your child. This is followed by suggestions that
guide you to<p>
<p><ul>
   <li> read with your child and make this all-important time
     together enjoyable;<p>
   <li> stimulate your child's interest in reading and language;
     and<p>
   <li> learn about your child's school reading programs and find
     ways to help.<p>
</ul>
<p>
     While most of the book is for parents of children up to 10
years of age, there is a brief section for parents of older
children on how to help them continue to grow as readers.
<p>
     Finally, there is a resource section. As you make reading
with your child a routine part of your lives, this section will
help you to find new ideas and a variety of books you both
might like.<p>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     You don't need to be an especially skillful reader
yourself to help your child. In fact, some public libraries
offer adult literacy programs that involve reading to children
as a way to improve literacy skills for the whole family. Nor
do you have to devote great amounts of time to reading with
your child. It's the quality of time that counts. Just be
consistent--give as much time as you can each day to help your
child. The activities suggested are designed to fit into busy
schedules.<p>
<p>
     Helping your child become a reader is an adventure you
will not want to miss. The benefits to your child are
immeasurable, and in the process you will find your world
becoming richer as well.<p>

<h3><a name="The Basics">The Basics</a></h3><p>
<p>
<p>
     There is no more important activity for preparing your
child to succeed as a reader than reading aloud together. Fill
your story times with a variety of books. Be consistent, be
patient, and watch the magic work.<p>
<p>
<p>
<h4> <a name="Start Young and Stay">Start Young and Stay with It </a></h4>
<p>
<p>
     At just a few months of age, an infant can look at
pictures, listen to your voice, and point to objects on
cardboard pages. Guide your child by pointing to the pictures,
and say the names of the various objects. By drawing attention
to pictures and associating the words with both pictures and
the real-world objects, your child will learn the importance of
language.<p>
<p>
     Children learn to love the sound of language before they
even notice the existence of printed words on a  page. Reading
books aloud to children stimulates their imagination and
expands their understanding of the world. It helps them develop
language and listening skills and prepares them to understand
the written word. When the rhythm and melody of language become
a part of a child's life, learning to read will be as natural
as learning to walk and talk.<p>
<p>
     Even after children lean to read by themselves, it's still
important for you to read aloud together. By reading stories
that are on their interest level, but beyond their reading
level, you can stretch young readers' understanding and
motivate them to improve their skills.<p>
<p>

<p>
<h4> <a name="Advertise the Joy">Advertise the Joy of Reading! </a></h4>
<p>
<p>
     Our goal is to motivate children to want to read so they
will practice reading independently and, thus, become fluent
readers. That happens when children enjoy reading. We parents
can do for reading what fast food chains do for hamburgers...
ADVERTISE! And we advertise by reading great stories and poems
to children.<p>
<p>
     We can help our children find the tools they need to
succeed in life. Having access to information through the
printed word is an absolute necessity. Knowledge is power, and
books are full of it. But reading is more than just a practical
tool. Through books we can enrich our minds; we can also relax
and enjoy some precious leisure moments.<p>
<p>
     With your help, your children can begin a lifelong
relationship with the printed word, so they grow into adults
who read easily and frequently whether for business, knowledge,
or pleasure.<p>
<p>
<h4> <a name="Remember When">Remember When You Were Very Young</a></h4>
<p>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     Between the ages of 4 and 7, many children begin to
recognize words on a page. In our society this may begin with
recognition of a logo for a fast food chain or the brand name
of a favorite cereal. But, before long, that special moment
when a child holds a book and starts to decode the mystery of
written words is likely to occur.<p>
<p>
     You can help remove part of the mystery without worrying
about a lot of theory. Just read the stories and poems and let
them work their wonders. There is no better way to prepare your
child for that moment when reading starts to "click," even if
it's years down the road.

     It will help, however, if we open our eyes to some things
adult readers tend to take for granted. It's easier to be
patient when we remember how much children do not know. Here
are a few concepts we adults know so well we forget sometimes
we ever learned them.<p>
<ul>
  <li> There's a difference between words and pictures. Point to
     the print as you read aloud.<p>
<li> Words on a page have meaning, and that is what we learn to
     read.<p>
<li>Words go across the page from left to right. Follow with
     your finger as you read.<p>

   <li> Words on a page are made up of letters and are separated
     by a space.<p>

  <li> Each letter has at least two forms: one for capital
     letters and one for small letters.<p>
</ul>
<p>
     These are examples of hieroglyphics.<p>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted] [Graphic Omitted]
<p>
     Imagine how you would feel if you were trying to interpret
a book full of such symbols. That's how young readers feel.
But, a little patience (maybe by turning it into a puzzle you
can solve together) is certain to build confidence.

     It's no secret that activities at home are an important
supplement to the classroom, but there's more to it than that.
There are things that parents can give children at home that
the classrooms cannot give.<p>
<p>
     Children who are read to grow to love books. Over the
years, these children will have good memories to treasure. They
remember stories that made them laugh and stories that made
them cry. They remember sharing these times with someone they
love, and they anticipate with joy the time when they will be
able to read for themselves.<p>
<p>
     By reading aloud together, by being examples, and by doing
other activities, parents are in a unique position to help
children enjoy reading and see the value of it.

<h3> <a name="Important Things">Important Things To Know</a></h3>

<p>
<p>
     It is important to keep fun in your parent-child reading
and to let joy set the tone and pace. Here is a story to keep
in mind.<p>
<p>
     Shamu is a performing whale, to the delight of many.
However, she sometimes gets distracted and refuses to do her
tricks. When that happens, her trainers stand around in
dripping wetsuits and wait for her stubbornness to pass. They
know that when a 5,000-pound whale decides she doesn't want to
flip her tail on cue, there is very little anyone can do about
it. But whales like to play, and sooner or later Shamu returns
to the game of performing for her audience. Shamu's trainers
know this so they're always patient, they're always confident,
and they always make performing fun.<p>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     While helping your child become a reader is certainly
different from training a whale, the same qualities of
patience, confidence, and playfulness in your approach will get
results. If, from time to time, your child gets distracted and
loses interest, take a break. Children love to learn. Give them
a little breathing room, and their interest will always be
renewed.<p>

<p>
     Although the life of a parent is often hectic, you should
try to read with your child at least once a day at a regularly
scheduled time. But don't be discouraged if you skip a day or
don't always keep to your schedule. Just read to your child as
often as you possibly can.
<p>
     If you have more than one child, try to spend some time
reading alone with each child, especially if they're more than
2 years apart. However, it's also fine to read to children at
different stages and ages at the same time. Most children enjoy
listening to many types of stories. When stories are complex,
children can still get the idea and can be encouraged to ask
questions. When stories are easy or familiar, youngsters enjoy
these "old friends" and may even help in the reading. Taking
the time to read with your children on a regular basis sends an
important message: Reading is worthwhile.<p>

<h4> <a name="One More Time">One More Time </a></h4>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     You may go through a period when your child favors one
book and wants it read night after night. It is not unusual for
children to favor a particular story, and this can be boring
for parents. Keep in mind, however, that a favorite story may
speak to your child's interests or emotional needs. Be patient.
Continue to expose your children to a wealth of books and
eventually they will be ready for more stories.
<p>
<p>
<h4> <a name="Talking about Stories">Talking about Stories</a></h4>
<p>
<p>
     It's often a good idea to talk about a story you are
reading, but you need not feel compelled to talk about every
story. Good stories will encourage a love for reading, with or
without conversation. And sometimes children need time to think
about stories they have read. A day or so later, don't be
surprised if your child mentions something from a story you've
read together.<p>

<p>
     The following is intended to help you become a parent who
is great at reading with your child. You'll find ideas and
activities to enrich this precious time together.<p>
<p>
     Children become readers when their parents read to them.
It really is as simple as that. And here's the good news: It's
easy to do and it's great fun. With a little practice you will
be making the memories of a lifetime, memories both you and
your child will cherish.<p>
<p>
     It is best to read to your child early and often. But it's
never too late to begin. Start today. Although the activities
in this section are designed to enhance reading aloud with
preschoolers and beginning readers, a child is never too old to
be read to.<p>
<p>
     With youngsters, remember that reading is a physical act,
as well as a mental one. It involves hand-eye coordination. So,
when you read, involve your child by
<p>
<ul>
   <li> pointing out objects in the pictures;<p>

   <li>following the words with your finger (so your child
     develops a sense that the words go from left to fight on
     the page); and<p>

   <li> having your child help turn the pages (to learn that the
     pages turn from right to left).<p>
</ul>

<h4> <a name="Look for Books">Look for Books</a></h4>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted] [Graphic Omitted] [Graphic Omitted] [Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     The main thing is to find books you both love. They will
shape your child's first impression of the world of reading.
<p>
<EM>What to do</EM>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Ask friends, neighbors, and teachers to share the names of
     their favorite books.<p>
  <li> Visit your local public library, and as early as possible,
     get your child a library card. Ask the librarian for help
     in selecting books. (Also see <a href="#Resources">Resources</a>)<p>
 <li> Look for award-winning books. Each year the American
     Library Association selects children's books for the
     Caldecott Medal for illustration and the Newbery Medal for
     writing.<p>
  <li> Check the book review sections of newspapers and magazines
     for recommended new children's books.<p>
  <li> As soon as they're old enough, have your children join you
     in browsing for books and making selections.
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
  <li> If you and your child don't enjoy reading a particular
     book, put it aside and pick up another one. [Graphic Omitted]<p>
</ol>

<p>
     Keep in mind your child's reading level and listening
level are different. When you read easy books, beginning
readers will soon be reading along with you. When you read more
advanced books, you instill a love of stories, and you build
motivation that transforms children into lifelong readers.

<p>
     Babies love to listen to the human voice. What better way
than through reading!<p>
<p>
<EM>What you'll need</EM><p>
<p>
Some baby books (books made of cardboard or cloth with flaps to
     lift and holes to peek through)<p>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Start out by singing lullabies and folk songs to your
     baby. At around 6 months, look for books with brightly
     colored, simple pictures and lots of rhythm. (<EM>Mother Goose</EM>
     is perfect.) At around 9 months, include books that
     feature pictures and names of familiar objects.<p>

  <li> As you read, point out objects in the pictures and make
     sure your baby sees all the things that are fun to do with
     books. (<EM>Pat the Bunny by Dorothy Kunhardt</EM> is a classic
     touch-and-feel book for babies.)<p>

  <li> Vary the tone of your voice, sing nursery rhymes, bounce
     your knee, make funny faces, do whatever special effects
     you can to stimulate your baby's interest.<p>

  <li> Allow your child to touch and hold cloth and sturdy
     cardboard books.<p>

  <li> When reading to a baby, be brief but read often.<p>
</ol>
[Graphic Omitted] [Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     As you read to your baby, your child is forming an
association between books and what is most loved -- your voice
and closeness. Allowing babies to handle books deepens their
attachment even more.<p>

<h4> <a name="R and R">R and R: Repetition and Rhyme</a></h4><p>
<p>

[Graphic Omitted] [Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     Repetition makes books predictable, and young readers love
knowing what comes next.<p>
<p>
<EM>What you'll need</EM><p>
<p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Books with repeated phrases
<li>Short rhyming poems
</ul>
A few favorites are: <ul>
<li><EM>Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible
     No Good, Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst;</EM>
<li><EM>Brown Bear, Brown
     Bear, What Do You See? by Bill Martin, Jr.;</EM>
<li><EM>Horton Hatches
     the Egg by Dr. Seuss;</EM>
<li><EM>and The Little Engine That Could by
     Watty Piper</EM>.
</ul>
There are many good booklists that highlight
     those books with repetitive refrains. (See <a
href="#Resources">Resources</a>)
<p>
<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Pick a story with repeated phrases or a poem you and your
     child like.<p>
  <li> For example, read:<p>
<dl>
     <dt>Wolf Voice:<dd>       Little pig, little pig,
                       Let me come in.
<dt>
     Little Pig: <dd>      Not by the hair on my
                       chinny-chin-chin.
<dt>
     Wolf Voice: <dd>     Then I'll huff and I'll puff,
                       And I'll blow your house in!
</dl><p>
     After the wolf has blown down the first pig's house, your
     child will soon join in with the refrain.
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
   <li>Read slowly, and with a smile or a nod, let your children
     know you appreciate their participation.<p>
  <li> As children grow more familiar with the story, pause and
     give them the chance to "fill in the blanks."<p>
  <li> Encourage your children to pretend to read, especially
     books that contain repetition and rhyme. Most children who
     enjoy reading will eventually memorize all or parts of a
     book and imitate your reading.
</ol>
[Graphic Omitted] [Graphic Omitted]<p>
     When youngsters anticipate what's coming next in a story
or poem, they have a sense of mastery over books. When children
feel power, they have the courage to try. Pretending to read is
an important step in the process of learning to read.

     When children act out a good poem, they love its rhyme,
rhythm, and the pictures it paints with a few well-chosen
words. They grow as readers by connecting emotion with the
written word.<p>
<p>
<EM>What you'll need</EM><p>
<p>
<ul>
Poems that rhyme, tell a story, and are written from a child's
     point of view
</ul>
<p>
<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Read a poem slowly to your child, and bring all your
     dramatic talents to the reading. (In other words, ham it
     up.)
<p>
 <li> If there is a poem your child is particularly fond of,
     suggest acting out a favorite line. Be sure to award such
     efforts with delighted enthusiasm.
<p>
 <li> Then suggest acting out a verse, a stanza, or the entire
     poem. Ask your child to make a face of the way the
     character in the poem is feeling. Remember that facial
     expressions bring emotion into the performer's voice.
<p>
  <li> Again, be an enthusiastic audience for your child.
     Applause is always nice.
<p>
 <li> If your child is comfortable with the idea, look for a
     larger setting with an attentive, appreciative audience.
     Perhaps an after-dinner "recital" for family members would
     appeal to your child.
<p>
  <li> Mistakes are a fact of life, so ignore them.<p>
</ol>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     Poems are often short with lots of white space on the
page. This makes them manageable for new readers and helps to
build their confidence.

  <li> Listen attentively as your child reads.
<p>
  <li> Take turns. You read a paragraph and have your child read
     the next one. As your child becomes more at ease with
     reading aloud, take turns reading a full page. Keep in
     mind that your child may be focusing on how to read, and
     your reading helps to keep the story alive.
<p>
  <li> If your children have trouble reading words, you can help
     in several ways.<p>
<ul>
  <li> Tell them to skip over the word, read the rest of the
     sentence, and ask what word would make sense in the story.
<p>
   <li> Help them use what they know about letters and sounds.

     While reading with your child is most important, there are
other activities that help to get children ready to read. With
a solid foundation, your child will not only read, but will
read with enthusiasm.<p>
<p>
     Learning to read is part of learning language. It's like a
little leaguer leaning to hit a baseball. The young hitter must
learn to watch the ball when it is pitched, to step into it,
and to swing the bat to make the hit. It's a single event made
up of three acts. Baseball players learn to do all three at
once.<p>
<p>
     The same is true of learning language. When we use
language, we speak words out loud, we read words on paper, and
we write. This section has activities that encourage your child
to<p>
<ul>
   <li> speak
   <li> read
  <li> write
  <li> listen
</ul>
<p>

<p>
     Begin long before you expect your child actually to read,
and continue long after your child is an independent reader.

     What's "old hat" to you can be new and exciting to
preschoolers. When you talk about everyday experiences, you
help children connect their world to language and enable them
to go beyond that world to new ideas.<p>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>

<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> As you get dinner ready, talk to your child about things
     that are happening. When your 2- or 3-year-old "helps" by
     taking out all the pots and pans, talk about them. Which
     one is the biggest? Can you find a lid for that one? What
     color is this one?
<p>
  <li> When walking down the street and your toddler stops to
     collect leaves, stop and ask questions that require more
     than a "yes" or "no" answer. Which leaves are the same?
     Which are different? What else grows on trees?
<p>
  <li>Ask "what if" questions. What would happen if we didn't
     shovel the snow? What if that butterfly lands on your
     nose?<p>
<p>
  <li> Answer your children's endless "why" questions patiently.
     When you say, "I don't know, let's look it up," you show
     how important books are as resources for answering
     questions.
<p>
  <li> After your preschooler tells you a story, ask questions so
     you can understand better. That way children learn how to
     tell complete stories and know you are interested in what
     they have to say.<p>
<p>
  <li> Expose your children to varied experiences--trips to the
     library, museum, or zoo; walks in the park; or visits with
     friends and relatives. Surround these events with lots of
     comments, questions, and answers.

     Talking enables children to expand their vocabulary and
understanding of the world. The ability to carry on a
conversation is important for reading development. Remember, it

<p>
<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Hang posters of the alphabet on bedroom walls or make an
     alphabet poster with your child.
<p>
  <li> Label the things in your child's pictures. If your child
     draws a picture of a house, label it "house" and put it on
     the refrigerator.
<p>
 <li> Have your child watch you write when you make shopping or
     to-do lists. Say the words out loud and carefully print
     each letter.
<p>
  <li> Let your child make lists, too. Help your child form the
     letters and spell the words.
<p>
  <li> Look at newspapers and magazines with your child. Find an
     interesting picture and show it to your child as you read
     the caption out loud.
<p>
  <LI> Create a scrapbook. Cut out pictures of people and places
     and label them.
</ol>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted] [Graphic Omitted]<p>

     By exposing your child to words and letters often, your
child will begin to recognize the shapes of letters. The world
of words will become friendly.

     With very little effort, parents can introduce children to
the wide world of books.
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Visit the library. Get a library card in your child's name
     and one for yourself if you don't have one. Go to the
     children's section and spend time reading and selecting
     books to take home. Check out books yourself to show your
     child everyone can use and enjoy books and the library. Be
     sure to introduce your child to the librarian and ask
     about special programs the library has for children.
<p>
  <li>Start your own home library. Designate a bookcase or shelf
     especially for your child. Encourage your child to arrange
     the books by some method--books about animals, holiday
     books, favorite books.
<p>
  <li> Keep an eye out for inexpensive books at flea markets,
     garage sales, used book stores, and discount tables at
     book stores. Many public libraries sell old books once a
     year. You will find some real bargains!
<p>
  <li> Make your own books. (See activity on page 46.) Child-made
     books become lasting treasures and part of your home
     library.
<p>
</ol>

     Family stories enrich the relationship between parent and
child.<p>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Tell your child stories about your parents and
     grandparents. You might even put these stories in a book
     and add old family photographs.
<p>
 <li> Have your child tell you stories about what happened on
     special days, such as holidays, birthdays, and family
     vacations.
<p>
 <li> Reminisce about when you were little. Describe things that
     happened at school involving teachers and subjects you
     were studying. Talk about your brothers, sisters, or
     friends.
<p>
  <li>Write a trip journal with your child to create a new
     family story. Recording the day's special event and
     pasting the photograph into the journal ties the family
     story to a written record. You can also include everyday
     trips like going to the market or the park.
</ol>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     It helps for children to know that stories come from real
people and are about real events. When children listen to
stories, they hear the voice of the storyteller. This helps
them hear the words when they learn to read aloud or read
silently.<p>

     Children are great mimics. When you tell stories, your
child will begin to tell stories, too.
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>Have your child tell stories like those you have told.
     Ask: "And then what happened?" to urge the story along.
<p>
  <li> Listen closely when your child speaks. Be enthusiastic and
     responsive.
<p>
 <li> If you don't understand some part of the story, take the
     time to get your child to explain. This will help your
     child understand the relationship between a speaker and a
     listener and an author and a reader.
<p>
  <li> Encourage your child to express himself or herself. This
     will help your child develop a wide vocabulary. It can
     also help with pronouncing words clearly.

     Something important happens when children receive and
write letters. They realize that the printed word has a
purpose.
<p>
<p>
<EM>What you'll need</EM><p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Paper
<li>Pencil, crayon, or marker
</ul>

<p>
<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li> Send your child little notes (by putting them in a pocket
     or lunch box, for example). When your child shows you the
     note, read it out loud with expression. Some children will
     read the notes on their own.<p>
<li> When your child expresses a feeling or thought that's
     related to a person, have your child write a letter. Have
     your child dictate the words to you if your child doesn't
     write yet.<p>
<p>
     For example:<p>
<blockquote>
     Dear Grandma,<p>

     I like it when you make ice cream. It's better than the
     kind we buy at the store.<p>

     Your grandson,<p>

     Darryl<p>

     P.S. I love you.<p>
</blockquote>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
<p>
  <li> Ask the people who receive these notes to respond. An oral
     response is fine--a written response is even better.
<p>
  <li> Explain the writing process to your child: "We think of
     ideas and put them into words; we put the words on paper;
     people read the words; and people respond."
</ol>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     Language is speaking, listening, reading, and writing.
Each element supports and enriches the other. Sending letters
will help children become writers, and writing will make them
better readers.

     Television can be a great tool for education too. The keys
are setting limits, making good choices, taking time to watch
together, discussing what you view, and encouraging follow-up
reading.
<p>
<p>
<EM>What to do</EM><p>
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<ol>
  <li> Limit your child's television viewing time and make your
     rules and reasons clear. Involve your child in choosing
     which programs to watch. Read the TV schedule together to
     choose.
<p>
  <li> Monitor what your child is watching, and whenever
     possible, watch the programs with your child.
<p>
  <li> When you watch shows with your child, discuss what you
     have seen so your child can better understand the
     programs.
<p>
  <li> Look for programs that will stimulate your child's
     interests and encourage reading (such as dramatizations of
     children's literature and programs on wildlife, natural
     history, and science).
</ol>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     Many experts recommend that children watch <STRONG>no more than 10
hours of television each week</STRONG>. Limiting television viewing
frees up time for reading and writing activities.
<p>
     It is worth noting that captioned television shows can be
especially helpful with children who are deaf or
hard-of-hearing, studying English as a second language, or
having difficulty learning to read.

<h3> <a name="Parents and the Schools">Parents and the Schools</a></h3><p>
<p>
<p>
     Success in school depends, in large part, on your child's
ability to read, and your role in helping your child become a
reader extends into the classroom. The kind of support you
provide will, of course, change as your child grows older.
Your involvement and monitoring your child's progress in school
can help your child become a better reader.
<p>
     Involvement in school programs can take many forms, from
attending PTA meetings to volunteering in school activities.
Through action, not just words, you demonstrate to your child
that school is important.
<p>
     In monitoring your child's progress in learning to read,
you need to look at both the programs offered at school and
your child's performance. Below is a checklist for different
levels of schooling. There is much more information available
to help you evaluate school reading programs. (See <a href="#Resources For
Parents">Resources For Parents</a> )
<p>
<p>
 <STRONG>Kindergarten</STRONG><p>
<p>
<ul>
   <li> Do teachers frequently read aloud?
<p>
   <li> Are favorite stories read over and over again and is
     "pretend" reading encouraged?
<p>
   <li> Are there story discussions with opportunities for
     children to talk and listen?
<p>
   <li> Are there good materials available for children to read
     and have read to them?
<p>
  <li> Do teachers discuss with children the different purposes
     of reading?
<p>
  <li> Do children have opportunities to write? Do they compose
     messages to other people?
</ul>
<p>
<STRONG>Beginning Reading Programs</STRONG><p>
<p>
<p>
     When children start school, they receive their first
formal instruction in reading. At this stage, they learn to
identify words--by translating groups of letters into spoken
words.
<ul>
   <li> Does the program include teaching the relationship between
     letters and sounds (phonics)?
<p>
   <li>Are children reading stories that encourage them to
     practice what they are learning?
<p>
   <li> Are children's reading materials interesting? Do they
     accommodate a child's limited reading vocabulary and the
     need to practice word identification with exciting
     stories?<p>
<p>
   <li> Are teachers still reading stories aloud to children and
     including good children's literature?
</ul>
<p>
<STRONG>Developmental Reading Programs</STRONG><p>
<p>
<ul>
   <li> Do reading and writing activities occur in every classroom
     and in every subject studied? As you walk through the
     school, do you see displays of children's writing on
     bulletin boards?
<p>
   <li> Are teachers providing direct instruction--teaching
     strategies that help students become better readers?
<p>
   <li> Are there plenty of opportunities for children to practice
     reading? (For third and fourth graders, this should
     include at least two hours a week of independent reading
     in school.)
<p>
   <li> Are there well-stocked school or classroom libraries?
     (Schools may enrich their collections by borrowing from a
     local public library.)
<p>
   <li> Are children encouraged to write meaningfully about what
     they read? It is not enough to fill in the blanks on
     worksheets; the point is to have children think about what
     they read, relate it to what they already know, and
     communicate these thoughts to others.
</ul>
<p>
<STRONG>Evaluating Your Child's Progress</STRONG><p>
<p>
<p>
     It is important to monitor your child's progress through
reports from the teacher. Also, it is important to attend
school open houses or similar events where teachers are
available to explain the program and discuss children's
progress with their parents.
<p>
     If you think your child should be doing better, consider
meeting privately with the teacher. In most cases, the teacher
and principal will be able to shed light on your child's
progress and what you might do to help. Your school system may
have access to special resources such as a reading specialist
and guidance counselor or to materials to address your child's
needs.

     You may want additional help for your child. A good
starting point is the nearest college or university. Most have
reading tutorial services that are available on a sliding-fee
scale. If not, there may be faculty or graduate students
interested in tutoring. Then monitor your child's progress the
same way you would his progress in school. If you do not see a
difference in performance in 6 to 8 weeks, discuss the program
with your child's tutor. Can the tutor explain the goals of the
program and document your child's progress? If not, you may
wish to consider another course of action.
<p>
     Some children struggle with reading problems where the
cause is readily identifiable. Some of the more widely
recognized causes of reading problems are vision and hearing
impairments and poor speech and language development.
But there are other schoolchildren who have problems reading
because of a learning disability. Whatever the cause or nature
of a child's reading problem, the earlier the difficulty is
discovered and additional help provided, the better the child's
chances are of becoming a successful reader. ( <a href="#Resources For
Parents"> See Resources - For Parents</a>)

     The good news is that no matter how long it takes, with
few exceptions, children can learn to read. One of the most
important roles you can play in relation to your children's
schoolwork is that of cheerleader. Applaud their efforts and
their successes. Help them have the courage to keep trying.

<h3> <a name="A Postscript">A Postscript about Older Children</a></h3>
<p>
     You can't put a teenager on your lap and read stories
every night. But you can still help older children become
enthusiastic and fluent readers by adapting many of the same
principles that work with the little ones. It is especially
important to continue the following efforts:
<ul>
   <li> Encourage reading for the fun of it and as a free-time
     activity.
<p>
   <li> Create an environment rich with books.
<p>
   <li> Talk and listen to your children. Language is like a
     four-legged stool: Speaking, listening, reading, and
     writing are its parts, and each supports the other.
<p>
   <li> Read with your children every chance you get--even if it's
     just part of a newspaper article at the breakfast table.
<p>
   <li> Encourage children to write by responding to the ideas
     they try to communicate in writing.
<p>
   <li> Set the example--put a book in your hands and be sure your
     children know you read for enjoyment and to get needed
     information.
<p>
   <li> Monitor your children's schoolwork and applaud their
     efforts.

<STRONG><I>Children's Books and Real-Life Events</I></STRONG><p>
<p>
<p>
     One sure way to get children to love to read is to make
connections between books and what happens in their lives. If
the book relates to what happened in real life and children see
themselves in it, both the story and the event take on greater
meaning. There are numerous books that deal with almost any
event in a child's life. We present here a few illustrative
topics to show the relation between books and life. Topics
chosen include celebrating family occasions; the very personal
experience of a loose tooth; a new baby; and knowing more about
explorations in outer space.

<h2> <a name="Foreword">Foreword</a> </h2>

<p>

Families play a vital role in educating America's children.  What
families do is more important to student success than whether
they are rich or poor, whether parents have finished high school
or not, or whether children are in elementary, junior high, or
high school.<br><br>

Yet, for all that common sense and research tell us, family
involvement often remains neglected in the debate about American
school reform.  To focus more attention on this important
subject, the U.S. Congress recently added to an initial list of
six National Education Goals another that states:<br><br>

Every school will promote partnerships that will increase
parental involvement and participation in promoting the social,
emotional, and academic growth of children.<br><br>

The Office of Educational Research and Improvement has produced
Helping Your Child With Homework to contribute to the drive to
increase family involvement in children's learning.  As the
handbook points out, we know that children who spend more time on
homework, on average, do better in school, and that the academic
benefits increase as children move into the upper grades.<br><br>
 
But the value of homework extends beyond school.  We know that
good assignments, completed successfully, can help children
develop wholesome habits and attitudes.  Homework can help
parents learn about their children's education and communicate
both with their children and the schools.  And it can encourage a
lifelong love of learning.<br><br>

In addition to helping with homework, there are many other
important ways that parents can help their children learn. 
Parents can encourage children to spend more leisure time reading
than watching television.  They can talk with their children and
communicate positive behaviors, values, and character traits. 
They can keep in touch with the school.  And they can express
high expectations for children and encourage their efforts to
achieve.<br><br>

We hope Helping Your Child With Homework can lead all of you
facing the challenges of raising children one step closer to
success. Indeed, family involvement in education is crucial if we
want our children to succeed in school and throughout life.<br><br>

<h2> <a name="Homework">Homework: A Concern for the Whole Family</a> </h2>


<p>Homework is an opportunity for students to learn and for parents
to be involved in their children's education. A parent's interest
can spark enthusiasm in a child and help teach the most important
lesson of all--that learning can be fun and is well worth the
effort.<br><br>

However, helping your child with homework isn't always easy. At
PTA meetings and at parent-teacher conferences, mothers and
fathers ask:<br><br>
<ul>

<li>How can I get Michael to do his homework? Every night
it's a struggle to get him to turn off the television and do his
homework.<br><br>

<li>Why isn't Maria getting more homework? (Why is Jonathan
getting so much homework?)<br><br>
 
<li>When is Tanya supposed to do homework? She takes piano
lessons, sings in her church choir, plays basketball, and helps
with family chores. There's hardly any time left to study.<br><br>
 
<li>How can I help Robert with his math homework when I don't
understand it?<br><br>
 
<li>Do homework assignments really help my child learn?
</ul>

This book helps answer these questions--and many others--that
parents and others who care for children in elementary and junior
high school often ask about homework. Included are practical
ideas for helping children complete homework assignments
successfully. Some of the ideas in this book may also be helpful
for high school students. </p>

<h2> <a name="Basics">The Basics</a></h2>

<p> Before discussing ways you can help your child with homework, it
is important to discuss why teachers assign homework and how it
benefits your child.

<H3>Why Do Teachers Assign Homework?</H3>
<p>Teachers assign homework for many reasons. Homework can help
children
 
<UL>
<LI>review and practice what they've learned;
<LI>get ready for the next day's class;
<LI>learn to use resources, such as libraries, reference materials, and encyclopedias; and
<li>explore subjects more fully than time permits in the classroom.
</UL>

 
Homework can also help children develop good habits and
attitudes.<br><br>

It can teach children to work independently;
encourage self-discipline and responsibility (assignments
provide some youngsters with their first chance to manage time
and meet deadlines); and encourage a love of learning.<br><br>
Homework can also bring parents and educators closer together.
Parents who supervise homework and work with their children on
assignments learn about their children's education and about the
school.<br><br>

Homework is meant to be a positive experience and to encourage
children to learn. Assignments should not be used as punishment.</p>
 
<H3>Does Homework Help Children Learn?</H3>

<p>Homework helps your child do better in school when assignments
are meaningful, are completed successfully, and are returned with
constructive comments from the teacher. An assignment should have
a specific purpose, come with clear instructions, be fairly well
matched to a student's abilities, and designed to help develop a
student's knowledge and skills.<br><br>  

In the early elementary grades, homework can help children
develop the habits and attitudes described earlier. From fourth
through sixth grades, small amounts of homework, gradually
increased each year, may support improved academic achievement.
In seventh grade and beyond, students who complete more homework
score better on standardized tests and earn better grades, on the
average, than students who do less homework. The difference in
test scores and grades between students who do more homework and
those who do less increases as children move up through the
grades.</p>

<H3>What's the Right Amount of Homework?</H3>  

<p>Many educators believe that homework is most effective for the
majority of children in first through third grades when it does
not exceed 20 minutes each school day. From fourth through sixth
grades, many educators recommend from 20 to 40 minutes a school
day for most students. For students in seventh through ninth
grades, generally, up to 2 hours a school day is thought to be
suitable.<br><br>  

Amounts that vary from these guidelines are fine for some
students. Talk with your child's teacher if you are concerned
about either too much or too little homework.</p>

<H2><a name="Howtohelp">How To Help: Show You Think Education and Homework Are Important</a></H2>

<p>Children need to know that their parents and adults close to them
think homework is important. If they know their parents care,
children have a good reason to complete assignments and turn them
in on time. There is a lot that you can do to show that you value
education and homework.

<H3>Set a Regular Time.</H3>  

Finding a regular time for homework helps children finish
assignments. The best schedule is one that works for your child
and your family. What works well in one household may not work in
another. Of course, a good schedule depends in part on your
child's age, as well as individual needs. For instance, one
youngster may work best in the afternoon after an hour of play,
and another may be more efficient after dinner (although late at
night, when children are tired, is seldom a good time).<br><br>

Outside activities, such as sports or music lessons, may mean
that you need a flexible schedule. Your child may study after
school on some days and in the evening on others. If there isn't
enough time to finish homework, your child may need to drop some
outside activity. Homework must be a high priority.<br><br>

You'll need to work with your elementary school child to develop
a schedule. An older student can probably make up a schedule
independently, although you'll want to make sure it's a good one.<br><br>

It may help to write out the schedule and put it in a place where
you'll see it often, such as the refrigerator door.<br><br>
 
Some families have a required amount of time that children must
devote to homework or some other learning activity each school
night (the length of time can vary depending upon the child's
age).  For instance, if your seventh-grader knows she's expected
to spend an hour doing homework, reading, or visiting the
library, she may be less likely to rush through assignments so
that she can watch television. A required amount of time may also
discourage her from "forgetting" to bring home assignments and
help her adjust to a routine. 
  
<H3>Pick a Place.</H3>  

A study area should have lots of light, supplies close by, and be
fairly quiet.<br><br>

A study area doesn't have to be fancy. A desk in the bedroom is
nice, but for many youngsters the kitchen table or a corner of
the living room works just fine.<br><br>

Your child may enjoy decorating a special study corner. A plant,
a brightly colored container to hold pencils, and some favorite
artwork taped to the walls can make study time more pleasant.
 
<H3>Remove Distractions.</H3>  

Turn off the television and discourage social telephone calls
during homework time. (A call to a classmate about an assignment
may, however, be helpful.)<br><br>

Some youngsters work well with quiet background music, but loud
noise from the stereo or radio is not OK. One Virginia junior
high school history teacher laments, "I've actually had a kid
turn in an assignment that had written in the middle, `And George
Washington said, "Ohhhhh, I love you."' The kid was so plugged
into the music that he wasn't concentrating."<br><br>

If you live in a small or noisy household, try having all family
members take part in a quiet activity during homework time. You
may need to take a noisy toddler outside or into another room to
play.  If distractions can't be avoided, your child may want to
complete assignments in a nearby library.

<H3>Provide Supplies and Identify Resources.</H3>  

For starters, collect pencils, pens, erasers, writing paper, an
assignment book, and a dictionary. Other things that might be
helpful include glue, a stapler, paper clips, maps, a
calculator, a pencil sharpener, tape, scissors, a ruler, index
cards, a thesaurus, and an almanac. Keep these items together in
one place if possible. If you can't provide your child with
needed supplies, check with the teacher, school guidance
counselor, or principal about possible sources of assistance.<br><br>
 
For books and other information resources, check with the school
library or local public library. Some libraries have homework
centers designed especially to assist children with school
assignments (there may even be tutors and other kinds of
individual assistance).<br><br>  

These days many schools have computers in classrooms, and many
households have personal computers. However, you don't have to
have a computer in your home in order for your child to complete
homework assignments successfully.<br><br>  
 
You may want to ask the teacher to explain school policy about
the use of computers--or typewriters or any special
equipment--for homework. Certainly, computers can be a great
learning tool and helpful for some assignments. They can be used
for word processing and on-line reference resources, as well as
educational programs and games to sharpen skills. Some schools
may offer after-school programs where your child can use the
school computers. And many public libraries make computers
available to children.

<H3>Set a Good Example.</H3>  

Children are more likely to study if they see you reading,
writing, and doing things that require thought and effort on your
part. Talk with your child about what you're reading and writing
even if it's something as simple as making the grocery list. Tell
them about what you do at work. Encourage activities that support
learning--for example, educational games, library visits, walks
in the neighborhood, trips to the zoo or museums, and chores that
teach a sense of responsibility.
 
<H3>Show an Interest.</H3>  

Make time to take your child to the library to check out
materials needed for homework (and for fun too), and read with
your child as often as you can. Talk about school and learning
activities in family conversations. Ask your child what was
discussed in class that day. If he doesn't have much to say, try
another approach. For example, ask your child to read aloud a
story he wrote or discuss the results of a science experiment.<br><br>

Another good way to show your interest is to attend school
activities, such as parent-teacher meetings, shows, and sports
events. If you can, volunteer to help in the classroom or at
special events. Getting to know some classmates and other parents
not only shows you're interested but helps build a network of
support for you and your child.</p>

<H2><a name="Howtohelp2">How To Help: Monitor Assignments</a></H2>

<p>Children are more likely to complete assignments successfully
when parents monitor homework. How closely you need to monitor
depends upon the age of your child, how independent she is, and
how well she does in school. Whatever the age of your child, if
assignments are not getting done satisfactorily, more supervision
is needed.<br><br>

Here are some good ways to monitor assignments:

<H3>Ask About the School's Homework Policy.</H3>  

At the start of the school year, ask the teacher:<br><br>

<UL>
<LI>What kinds of assignments will be given?
<LI>How long are children expected to take to complete them?
<li>How does the teacher want you to be involved?
</UL> 
 
Teachers' expectations vary. Ask your child's teacher what you
should do. Should you just check to make sure the assignment is
done, or should you do something more? Some teachers want parents
to go over the homework and point out errors, while others ask
parents to simply check to make sure the assignment is completed.<br><br>

It's also a good idea to ask the teacher to call you if any
problems with homework come up.

<H3>Be Available.</H3>  

Elementary school students often like to have someone in the same
room when working on assignments in case they have questions. If
your child will be cared for by someone else, talk to that person
about what you expect regarding homework. For an older child, if
no one will be around, let him know you want him to begin work
before you get home and call to remind him if necessary.
 
<H3>Look Over Completed Assignments.</H3>  

It's usually a good idea to check to see that your elementary
school child has finished her assignments. If your junior high
school student is having trouble finishing assignments, check his
too. If you're not there when an assignment is finished, look it
over when you get home. After the teacher returns completed
homework, read the comments to see if your child has done the
assignments satisfactorily.
 
<H3>Monitor Television Viewing.</H3>  

American children on average spend far more time watching
television than they do completing homework. In many homes, more
homework gets done when television time is limited. Once you and
your child have worked out a homework schedule, take time to
discuss how much television and what programs she can watch. It's
worth noting that television can be a learning tool. Look for
programs that relate to what your child is studying in school,
such as programs on history or science or dramatizations of
children's literature. When you can, watch shows with your child,
discuss them, and encourage follow-up activities such as reading
or a trip to the museum.
</p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<H2><a name="Howtohelp3">How To Help: Provide Guidance</a></H2>

<p>The basic rule is, "Don't do the assignments yourself." It's not
your homework--it's your child's. "I've had kids hand in homework
that's in their parents' handwriting," one Washington, DC-area
eighth-grade teacher complains. Doing assignments for your child
won't help him understand and use information. And it won't help
him become confident in his own abilities.<br><br>
   
It can be hard for parents to let children work through problems
alone and learn from their mistakes. It's also hard to know where
to draw the line between supporting and doing.<br><br>

Different teachers have different ideas about the best way for
parents to provide guidance. Here are a few suggestions with
which most teachers agree:
 
<H3>Figure Out How Your Child Learns Best.</H3>  

If you understand something about the style of learning that
suits your child, it will be easier for you to help her.<br><br>

If you've never thought about this style, observe your child. See
if he works better alone or with someone else. If your child gets
more done when working with someone else, he may want to complete
some assignments with a brother or sister or a classmate. (Some
homework, however, is meant to be done alone. Check with the
teacher if you aren't sure.)<br><br>
  
Other things to consider about learning style:<br><br>
  
Does your child learn things best when she can see
them? If so, drawing a picture or a chart may help with some
assignments. For example, after reading her science book, she may
not remember the difference between the tibia and the fibula. But
by drawing a picture of the leg and labeling the bones, she can
remember easily.<br><br>
 
Does your child learn things best when he can hear them?  He may
need to listen to a story or have directions
read to him. Too much written material or too many pictures or
charts may confuse him.<br><br>

Does your child understand some things best when
she can handle or move them? An apple cut four or six or eight
ways can help children learn fractions.
  
<H3>Help Your Child Get Organized.</H3> 

As mentioned earlier, it's a good idea to set a regular time for
children to do homework. Put up a calendar in a place where
you'll see it often and record assignments on it. If your child's
not able to write yet, then do it for him until he can do it
himself.  Writing out assignments will get him used to the idea
of keeping track of what's due and when. You may want to use an
assignment book instead of a calendar.<br><br>

A bag for books will make it easier to carry homework to and from
school. Homework folders in which youngsters can tuck their
assignments for safekeeping help many students stay organized. 

<H3>Encourage Good Study Habits.</H3> 

Teachers generally give students tips on how to study. But it
takes time and practice to develop good habits. You can reinforce
these habits at home. For example:<br><br>

Help your child structure time in order to complete
assignments.  For example, if your eighth-grader has a biology
report due in 3 weeks, discuss all the steps she needs to take to
complete it on time, including:

<UL>
<LI>selecting a topic;
<LI>doing the research by looking up books and other
<LI>materials on the topic and taking notes;
<LI>figuring out what questions to discuss;
<LI>drafting an outline;
<LI>writing a rough draft; and
<li>revising and completing the final draft.
</UL> 

Encourage your child to write down how much time she
expects to spend on each step.<br><br>

Help your child get started when he has to do research reports or
other big assignments. Encourage him to use the library. If he
isn't sure where to begin, have him ask the librarian for
suggestions. If he's using a computer for on-line reference
resources--whether the computer's at home, school, or the
library--make sure he's getting whatever help he needs to use it
properly. As mentioned earlier, many public libraries have
homework
centers where there are tutors or other kinds of one-on-one
assistance. After your child has done the research, listen while
he tells you the points he wants to make in the report.<br><br>

Give practice tests. Help your third-grader prepare for a
spelling test by saying the words while she writes them down.
Then have her correct her own test.<br><br>

Help your child avoid last-minute cramming. Review with your
fifth-grader how to study for his  social studies test well
before it's to be given. You can have him work out a schedule of
what he needs to do to, make up a practice test, and write down
answers to the questions he's made up.<br><br>
 
Talk with your child about how to take a test. Be sure she
understands how important it is to read the instructions
carefully and to keep track of the time and avoid spending too
much time on any one question.<br><br>
 
Several books and pamphlets listed in the Resources section of
this book give more tips on how your child can get organized and
develop good study habits.
 
<H3>Talk About the Assignments.</H3>  

Ask your child questions. Talking can help him think through an
assignment and break it down into small, workable parts. Here are
some sample questions:<br><br>


Do you understand what you're supposed to do? After your child
has read the instructions, ask her to tell you in her own words
what the assignment is about. (If your child can't read yet, the
teacher may have sent home instructions that you can read to
her.) Some schools have homework hotlines you can call for
assignments in case your child misplaced a paper or was absent
that day. If your child doesn't understand the instructions, read
them
with her and talk about the assignment. Are there words she
doesn't understand? How can she find out what they mean? If
neither you nor your child understands an assignment, call a
classmate or contact the teacher.<br><br>
 
What do you need to do to finish the assignment? Your child may
want to talk through the steps with you (or make a written list
of them, if he's able to), as described in the section above on
good study habits.<br><br> 
 
Do you need help in understanding how to do your work? See if
your child needs to learn more, for example, about subtracting
fractions before she can do her assignment. Or find out if the
teacher needs to explain to her again when to use capital and
lowercase letters. If you understand the subject yourself, you
may want to work through some examples with your child. But let
her do the assignment herself.<br><br>

Have you ever done any problems like the ones you're supposed to
do right now? See if your child has already done similar problems
that can guide him in completing these particular ones.<br><br>

Do you have everything you need to do the assignment? Sometimes
your child needs special supplies, such as colored pencils,
metric rulers, maps, or reference books. As mentioned before,
check with the teacher, school guidance counselor, or principal
for possible sources of assistance if you can't provide needed
supplies; and check with the local public library or school
library for books and other information resources.<br><br>

Does your answer make sense to you? Sometimes the response to a
math problem doesn't seem logical, or the meaning of a paragraph
your child has written is unclear. If that's the case, your child
may need to check over the math problem or revise the paragraph.<br><br>

If your child is still confused, ask:<br>
<ul>

<li>How far have you gotten on the assignment? Let's try to
figure out where you're having a problem.

<li>Do you need to review your notes (or reread a chapter in
your textbook) before you do the assignment? 

<li>Are you still having problems? Maybe it would help to take a
break or have a snack.
</ul>

 
<H3>Give Praise.</H3> 
 
People of all ages respond to praise. And children need
encouragement from the people whose opinions they value
most--their parents. "Good first draft of your book report!" or
"You've done a great job" can go a long way toward motivating
your child to complete assignments.<br><br>  

Children also need to know when they haven't done their best
work.  Make criticism constructive. Instead of telling a
third-grader, "You aren't going to hand in that mess, are you?"
try, "The teacher will understand your ideas better if you use
your best handwriting." Then give praise when a neat version is
completed. </p>

<H2><a name="Howtohelp4">How To Help: Talk With Someone at School To Resolve Problems</a></h2>

<p>Homework hassles can often be avoided when parents and caregivers
value, monitor, and guide their children's work on assignments. 
But, sometimes helping in these ways is not enough. Problems can
still come up. If they do, the schools, teachers, parents, and
students may need to work together to resolve them.

<H3>Share Concerns With the Teacher.</H3>

You may want to contact the teacher if<br>
 
<ul><li>your child refuses to do her assignments, even though
you've tried hard to get her to do them;
<li>instructions are unclear; 
<li>you can't seem to help your child get organized to finish
the assignments;
<li>you can't provide needed supplies or materials; 
<li>neither you nor your child can understand the purpose of
assignments; 
<li>the assignments are often too hard or too easy;
<li>the homework is assigned in uneven amounts--for instance,
no homework is given on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, but on
Thursday four of your child's teachers all make big assignments
that are due the next day; or
<li>your child has missed school and needs to make up
assignments.
</ul>

In some cases, the school guidance counselor may be helpful in
resolving such problems.

<H3>Work With the School.</H3>

Communication between teachers and parents is very important in
solving homework problems. Here are some important things to
remember:<br><br>

Talk with teachers early in the school year. Get acquainted
before problems arise, and let teachers know that you want to be
kept informed. Most elementary schools and many secondary schools
invite parents to come to parent-teacher conferences or open
houses. If your child's school doesn't provide such
opportunities, call the teacher to set up a meeting.<br><br>

Contact the teacher as soon as you suspect your child has a
homework problem (as well as when you think he's having any major
problems with his schoolwork). Schools have a responsibility to
keep parents informed, and you have a right to be upset if you
don't find out until report-card time that your child is having
difficulties. On the other hand, sometimes parents figure out
that a problem exists before the teacher does. By alerting the
teacher, you can work together to solve a problem in its early
stages.<br><br>

Request a meeting with the teacher to discuss homework problems.
Tell him briefly why you want to meet. You might say, "Rachel is
having trouble with her math homework. I'm worried about why she
can't finish the problems and what we might do to help her."
Parents for whom English is a second language may need to make
special arrangements, such as including another person who is
bilingual.<br><br>

Don't go straight to the principal without giving the teacher a
chance to work out the problem with you and your child.<br><br>

Approach the teacher with a cooperative spirit. Believe that the
teacher wants to help you and your child, even if you disagree
about something. It's hard to solve problems if teachers and
parents view each other as enemies.<br><br>

If you have a complaint, try not to put the teacher on
the defensive. For example, avoid saying that you think the
assignments are terrible even if you think so. You might say,
"I'm glad Calvin is learning to add and subtract in the first
grade, but he doesn't want to do his math work sheets. Can we
find another way for him to learn the same material?" This might
encourage the teacher to let Calvin (and the rest of his
classmates) try another approach. Perhaps he can learn addition
and subtraction by moving around buttons, sticks, or shells.<br><br>
 
Let the teacher know if your child is bored with
assignments or finds them too hard or too easy. (Teachers also
like to know when children are particularly excited about an
assignment.) Of course, not all homework assignments can be
expected to interest your child and be perfectly suited to her. 
Teachers just don't have time to tailor homework to the
individual needs of each student night after night. However, most
teachers want to assign homework that children enjoy and can
complete successfully, and they welcome feedback from parents.<br><br>

Many times homework can be structured so that a wide
range of children will find assignments interesting. For example:<br>
  
<ul><li>Different approaches to the same topic or lesson can be
offered to students;
  
<li>Extra assignments can be given to students who want more
challenge; and
  
<li>Specialized assignments can be given to students having
trouble in a particular area.
</ul>
 
While meeting with the teacher, explain what you think is going
on. Also tell the teacher if you don't know what the problem is.
Sometimes a child's version of what's going on isn't the same as
the teacher's version. For example, your child may tell you that
the teacher never explains assignments so he can understand them.
But the teacher may tell you that your child isn't paying
attention
when assignments are given.<br><br>

Work out a way to solve or lessen the problem. The strategy will
depend on what the problem is, how severe it is, and the needs of
your child. For instance:<br>

<ul>  
<li>Is the homework often too hard? Maybe your child has
fallen behind and will need extra help from a teacher, parent, or
tutor to catch up.
  
<li>Does your child need to make up a lot of work because of
absences? The first step might be working out a schedule with the
teacher.
  
<li>Has your child been diagnosed with a learning disability
or is one suspected? If so, you'll need to make sure your child
gets extra help, and the teacher may need to adjust some
assignments. (See Federal Sources of Assistance in the Resources
Section of this book.)
</ul> 
  
Does your child need extra support, beyond what home and school
can give? Ask the teacher, school guidance counselor, or
principal if there are mentor programs in your community. Mentor
programs pair a child with an adult volunteer who assists with
the youngster's special needs, such as tutoring or career advice.<br><br>

There are many good mentor programs operating in schools,
universities, community organizations, churches, and businesses.<br><br>

Make sure communication is clear. Listen to the teacher and don't
leave until you're sure you understand what's being said.  Make
sure, too, that the teacher understands what you have to say. If,
after the meeting, you realize you don't understand something,
call the teacher to doublecheck.<br><br>

It may help to summarize what you've agreed to do at the
end of the meeting:<br><br>


OK, so to keep track of Kim's assignments, I'll check her
assignment book each night and write my initials by new
assignments. Each day you'll check to make sure she's written
down all new assignments in her book. That way we'll be certain
that I know what her assignments are.<br><br>

Follow up to make sure that the approach you agreed to is
working. If the teacher told you, for example, that your child
needs to spend more time practicing long division, check back in
a month to talk about your child's progress.<br><br>
 
Homework can bring together children, parents, and teachers in
a common effort to improve student learning. The younger your
child is when you start to do the kinds of activities suggested
in this guide, the better.<br><br>

Helping your child with homework is an opportunity to improve
your child's chances of doing well in school and life. By helping
your child with homework, you can help him learn important
lessons about discipline and responsibility. You can open up
lines of communication--between you and your child, and you and
the school.  You are in a unique position to help your child make
connections between school work and the "real world," and thereby
bring meaning (and some fun) to your child's homework experience.<br><br>

Whether you succeed in doing all of the activities suggested in
this guide is not what's most important. What's most important is
that you are willing to take the time and make the effort to be
involved in your child's education.

<uL><li>Do you understand and respect your child's style of
learning? Does he work better alone or with someone else?  Does
he learn best when he can see things, hear them, or handle them? 

<br><br><li>Do you help your child to get organized?  Does your
child need a calendar or assignment book?  A bag for books and a
folder for papers?  

<br><br><li>Do you encourage your child to develop good study
habits (e.g., scheduling enough time for big assignments; making
up practice tests)?

<br><br><li>Do you talk with your child about homework
assignments?  Does she understand them?

<H3>Talk With Someone at School When Problems Come Up.</H3>

<uL><li>Do you meet the teacher early in the year before any problems
arise?

<br><br><li>If a problem comes up, do you meet with the teacher?

<br><br><li>Do you cooperate with the teacher and your child to
work out a plan and a schedule to fix homework problems?

<br><br><li>Do you follow up with the teacher and with your child
to make sure the plan is working?

<P><B><I>In my childhood I wanted to grow up to be able-bodied. I would be cured and never have polio again. Or, I wanted to be a boy. My father paid my brother for his chores but not me, even though I was older, because, "you're a girl and you're supposed to do housework." Boys could grow up to be important, even if they were disabled. There was Franklin Roosevelt, Beethoven, Ironsides, and all those athletes making miraculous recoveries. But there was no one I could be, except maybe Helen Keller. (O'Toole 1979)</I></B></P>

<H3>Why the
Differences? A
Look at Society</H3>

<P>Being a female and having a disability both have ramifications for the individual. In our society and in our schools, each of these descriptions engenders preconceived notions, expectations, and stereotypes. In both instances, it is the negative stereotypes that hold girls back or unnecessarily channel them into certain types of programs and jobs.</P>

<P>Although much has been written about parenting children with disabilities, few studies mention the gender of the children and still fewer suggest that gender makes a difference (Fine &amp; Asch, 1988). Yet we know from research that, from the earliest moments of life, parents and others react to and treat boys differently than girls. In a now classic study, groups of people observed the behavior of a 15-day old infant on videotape. One group was told the infant was a boy, the other that it was a girl. Observers described the "boy" as more active and outgoing, while the "girl" was described as passive, crying, and in need of help (Condry &amp; Condry, 1978).</P>

<P>Typically, boys are encouraged to be sturdy, to dare, to go out and meet the world. They are expected to become self-supporting, in anticipation of the day when they will have to support a family. Girls, on the other hand, being perceived as more passive, are sheltered. As the future "nurturers" of society, they are rewarded for their sensitivity to the needs of others and their ability to cooperate rather than aggressively pursue their own interests.</P>

<P>Differences in formal schooling emerge from how society views differences between males and females. For example, for the past century educators have assumed that boys learn to read more slowly than girls and are more prone to having reading disabilities such as dyslexia. In a recent Newsweek article (May 28, 1990), author Laura Shapiro reports that, in order to remedy these deficits, the schools employ a number of remedial reading teachers whose classes are filled primarily with boys. In contrast, girls have usually fallen behind in math by the time they reach high school. Yet, significantly fewer remedial math teachers are employed to help the girls during their elementary and junior high years when the problems are first identified. "Girls are supposed to be less good at math, so that difference is incorporated into the way we live" (p. 57). in an interesting counterpoint to this educational inequity, the findings of three recent studies refute the long-standing notion that boys are more prone to have dyslexia (Kolata, 1990). in one of the studies, conducted by Yale University, more than four times as many second-grade boys as girls were diagnosed by the school system as being dyslexic, and more than twice as many third-grade boys as girls. The Yale University researchers, testing the same children independently, found that equal numbers of boys and girls had reading difficulties. Dr. Sally Shaywitz, the co-director of the Center for the Study of Learning and Attention Disorders at Yale, says, "Girls, who really need help, are failing to be noticed" (Kolata, 1990, p. B6).</P>

<P>How do stereotypes of male and female behavior and potential affect children with disabilities? To begin with, many adults feel that children with disabilities need more help. Boys with disabilities can often escape the disability stereotype of helplessness or dependence by aspiring to such traditional male characteristics as competence, autonomy, and work. Girls with disabilities, however, confront two stereotypes: the "passive, dependent" female and the "helpless and dependent" person with a disability. As a result, they often get a double dose of assistance that can lead to a kind of a dependence called <I>learned helplessness </I>(Lang, 1982).</P>

<P>There is no doubting that society bombards us, via television and magazines, with images of the "ideal" female. Probably the ideal most damaging psychologically to many people with disabilities is this society's emphasis on physical beauty or attractiveness. While thousands of dollars are spent on cosmetics, physical fitness, clothes and hair-stylists, most of us fall far short of the ideal. Yet, we all strive for it. However, the gap between the ideal and reality varies from person to person, and many women with disabilities are affected more negatively.</P>

<P>Images showing motherhood and homemaking are also very powerful, and it is normal for parents and their daughter with a disability to identify with these roles. These are certainly very important roles in our society. Yet, young women with disabilities are less likely than their nondisabled peers to take on the traditional role of wife (Bowe, 1983) and even less likely to have the role of mother. When young girls and women are not encouraged to be independent and achieve some level of economic sufficiency, and believe or know that the options of wife and mother are closed to them, they are denied a meaningful role in adult life, a situation that results in <I>rolelessness</I> (Fine &amp; Asch, 1988). The lack of having a part to play in life produces low self-esteem and a lack of confidence in one's self and one's activities and ideas. This can and does cause further dependence for the roleless person, most often on the parents and then on whomever later assumes the role of caretaker.</P>

<P>Today, in our society, single women who live alone and work are accorded more freedoms and respect than ever before. This is not am uncommon situation for a woman to be in, and many are successful in their work, self-sufficient, and prefer their independence. A woman in our society no longer has to derive her status from her husband. This is an important concept for a young woman with disabilities and her family to understand; women with disabilities who work and do not marry can find peers, both disabled and nondisabled, in similar situations. For those who choose otherwise, there are growing numbers of women with disabilities successfully married and with children who can serve as role models. What is important to understand here is that women with disabilities have the same options and choices for a lifestyle, and to be happy in that life style, as do women without disabilities.</P>

<P>While the above is true, we still have stereotypes, and young women with disabilities who receive vocational guidance and training are not exempt from society's pervasive ideas of what a male and female can and should do. Kratovil and Bailey (1986) summarize a number of studies that found that women with a disability, some receiving vocational counseling, others participating in workstudy programs or receiving vocational rehabilitation training, tend to be given guidance or instruction that tracks them into jobs consistent with traditional sex-role stereotypes. Such jobs tend to be service-oriented, lower paying, lower skilled, and generally less interesting. Female special education students rarely have access to courses in business, for example, which could lead to higher paying jobs. On the other hand, males with disabilities are placed in programs that provide training in a specific trade and also have many more opportunities for actual job training experiences. Moreover, they are trained for higher paying jobs that offer chances for advancement.</P>

<P>Women who are not disabled intellectually also have a difficult time. There is still a tendency on the part of people who are uninformed about disabilities to see a person with a physical disability and immediately assume that he or she is also less cognitively capable. Much can be done to change this assumption, and other negative ones, through awareness training and the modeling of successful women with disabilities. Change begins, however, within the family and woman with a disability. Families need to believe that their daughter with a disability can achieve, and work to instill that belief in her during her earliest days.</P>

<P>Differences in vocational training, as well as the very low rate of females with disabilities who are in some type of post-secondary education program, clearly suggest gender bias and a lack of positive self-assertion on the part of the women with disabilities. Hasaziet. al. (1989), who point out that research with nondisabled youth also shows less positive employment outcomes for women, suggest that there are several factors involved, including discrimination in the work place. They also point to the tendency of women not to consider security and advancement aspirations and to have less self-confidence than males when it comes to seeking jobs.</P>

<P>"The severe disadvantage disabled women and girls suffer is revealed in the economic and social realities they ultimately face," state Kratovil and Bailey (1986). "After 12 years of public education, disabled women all too often find themselves ill-equipped to do anything but remain in the family home or be institutionalized" (p. 251). They conclude that "the plight of the disabled woman, striving to realize her maximum potential as a productive, self-sufficient individual, results in large part from a widespread attitude that although the disabled man must become self-supporting, the disabled woman will somehow be cared for and protected" (p. 252).</P>

<P><I><B>I never knew what would happen to me when l left school It scared me. I used to believe that when I graduated I'd die or live with my family forever. That was because I'd never met a deaf woman. (O'Toole 1979)</B></I></P>
<H3>What Can a Parent
Do? A Look Within</H3>

<P>There is no single or simple reason why these gender differences exist in our society, Yet they do exist. "Parents may wonder if gender roles are immutable... But burgeoning research indicates otherwise. No matter how stubborn the stereotype, individuals can challenge it; and they will if they're encouraged to try. Fathers and mothers should be relieved to hear that they do make a difference" (Shapiro, 1990, p. 56).</P>

<P>The difference parents can make begins with examining their own values and attitudes regarding male and female roles, parents may consciously or unconsciously have different expectations for their daughter and may not encourage as much independence and achievement as they have for sons. There is some research evidence, for example, that parents of females with mental retardation are less likely to encourage and expect self-sufficiency and community living than parents of males with mental retardation (Burchard, Hasazi, Gordon, Rosen, &amp; Dietzel, 1986). it can be assumed that this comes from their normal fears for their daughter's safety. There is no doubt that families have difficult decisions to make in this regard. They must decide their actions by considering the options and the consequences of dependency, and realize that parents will not always be around to protect and be social companions for their daughters with disabilities. Parents need only recall the statistics presented earlier to know that their lower expectations can inadvertently lead to the consequences of dependency, unemployment, and poverty.</P>

<P>Thus, it is imperative that parents of a daughter with a disability look within themselves and become aware of how gender bias enters into the decisions they make and allow others to make for their daughter. They cannot ignore the future or expect it to take care of itself. The responsibility for planning and preparing for their daughter's future as an independent and self-sufficient person is primarily theirs, while the ultimate decision of how she will live and where she will work is primarily hers.</P>

<H3>Steps Towards
Independence:
Beginning at Home</H3>

<P>What can parents do, in practical terms, to foster greater independence and self-sufficiency in their child? <B>Perhaps the single, most important thing parents can do to help their child is to expect her to <I>aspire</I>.</B> If parents truly want their daughter to realize her potential for independence, they must make this their expectation from day one. From infancy on, they should allow her as much autonomy as possible, stretching her vision rather than limiting it. She should be encouraged to go out and meet the world. This is a common thread running through the stories of women with disabilities who have strived for and gained independence and self-sufficiency, their parents expected and encouraged them to aspire and achieve (Harrison &amp; Rousso, 1989).</P>

<P>Here are some ideas that parents can put to use in their home and in their parenting style.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> <B>Start early.</B> Don't wait until your daughter is sixteen. Independence and self-determination are built one day at a time. Encouraging a child's learning, growth, and achievement should be a part of the daily consciousness and activities of the household.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> <B>Recognize that <I>your</I> behavior, as a family, may need to change. </B>It may need to change because you have come from a different culture with societal expectations that place limitations on women's achievement and self-determination. Or perhaps change is indicated because you do not know, or have not considered, the options available to your daughter in today's society due to new education programs and work opportunities.<BR><BR>

	<LI> <B>Take a personal assessment.</B> Identify the expectations you have, the assistance you routinely offer your daughter, and the motivation she has or is given to develop her capabilities. For example, if she is in a family with all female siblings, do you expect as much from your daughter with a disability? If she is in a family with male siblings, how are your expectations for her different? Families need to have the same expectations for their female and male children, and provide their daughters with the same opportunities they would give a male child with the same disabilities.<BR><BR>

</UL>

<P>The following suggestions are limited by the great variety of disabilities to be addressed. Probably the most beneficial advice is to really assess your daughter's abilities, and examine your thoughts about what you expect of your other children and of her. Think of ways she can become a more integral and contributing member of the family.</P>

<P><B><I>Expectations.</I></B> How much do you expect your daughter to do for herself? Take a look at your girl's day: Where can you expect her to do more for herself? Where can you expect her to do more within the household? Eve expects her daughter, Carol, who has a physical disability, to be a fully contributing member of the family. Duties and roles are assigned to 11 year-old Carol, with consideration of her disability, but neither the task nor the expectation that it be done each week or day, and done well, are any less than for Eve's other children, Eve strongly believes that the more you expect from your children, the more you'll get. Carol presently is responsible for vacuuming the downstairs carpet and upholstery; she can do this from her wheelchair. Carol is also responsible for dusting the downstairs furniture and, of course, for keeping her own room tidy. Carol cleans every Saturday morning with the rest of her family.</P>

<P><B><I>Assistance.</I></B> How much assistance do you offer your daughter? To achieve greater independence, she has to do things without constant help, reminders, and suggestions. And she can do these things, although it may take longer and be more difficult than if you do it for her. Your daughter may even tell you so, as Felicia, age 10, told her mother. Felicia, severely disabled by cerebral palsy, but with no cognitive disabilities, struggled to extract a pair of "cool" sunglasses from the small purse she carried. She fended off her mother's attempts to assist her, saying, "Mommy, I can do it, I can do it." While it was painful for the mother to watch the effort and the time it took Felicia to unzip her purse and extract the prized glasses, the mother forced herself to let Felicia accomplish her goal without help. This small task is only part of the family's ongoing efforts to allow Felicia to develop independence. Among other things, they have provided her with a motorized wheelchair, customized to compensate for her particular difficulties, and a communication board, both of which Felicia has mastered.</P>

<P>Many caregivers speak of the pain of watching their child's laborious efforts to perform what, to most of society, are routine tasks. And while it is natural to want to step in and help, and to spare your child the struggle, it is often better to let her do the task in her own time and in her own way. Then the achievement is hers. So, look closely at the assistance you give, and decide when and how it can be faded over time. Parents too must let go at their own pace and in their own way; no one would say that letting go of any child is an easy task. It may involve taking risks that you find disquieting. One mother, Joan, told of her personal compromise in letting her daughter with mental retardation, age 15, ride the bus alone. Joan was afraid for her daughter's safety. After discussing her concerns, Joan and her daughter agreed that Joan would shadow her by following the bus in her car for the first month that her daughter rode solo. Joan observed the people who waited with her daughter at the bus stop, asking herself if any might be suspicious. She watched her daughter's interactions with the people and observed where her daughter sat on the bus. (Joan had told her daughter to sit directly behind the bus driver.)  At home, Joan would discuss with her daughter "make believe" situations based on her observations. In this way, she could give her daughter suggestions on how to act, or what to do.</P>

<P>Roxanne, whose nine year old daughter has a learning disability, reported following her as she walked through a housing project alone to her after-school program. Roxanne hid behind trees and buildings so as not to be seen. She did this to assess her child's ability to make judgments in life situations, to avoid situations of potential danger, and to get to her destination without getting lost and in a timely manner.</P>

<P><I><B>Motivation.</B></I> Your daughter may very well want no part of being self-sufficient. It's much more convenient to have you! So you need to develop a system of rewards, such as attention, praise, tokens, or permitting her to do something she likes once the task has been completed successfully. Focus on her positive behaviors and reinforce these.</P>

<P>Another vital component of independence is <I>decision-making</I>. How do parents teach this complex skill? First, consider how it feels when you are told what to do, instead of being allowed to act according to your own preferences and judgment. Also, ponder how you learned to make decisions and how you taught your nondisabled children to be good decision-makers. As much as possible, apply the same methods to your daughter with a disability.</P>

<P>The reasons we make decisions, of course, cover a spectrum of daily and life choices. Knowing when to put on a jacket is a decision that a child who is deaf will not long find difficult; it may be a much more complex decision for a child with severe disabilities to make. Much modeling and repetition may be necessary to help such a child learn to make decisions herself. Howard, whose five year old daughter has a number of severe disabilities, recounts the process by which he taught Jana to recognize when a jacket was needed, to get the jacket, and to put it on herself. "I would just do it myself, at first, getting her the jacket and putting it on her. Then I started telling her to get the jacket. Then, for a long time we worked methodically on her putting on the jacket by herself. After she could do that, I started saying, 'Gee, it's cold today. What do you need to put on, if you're going outside?' It took a long time before she knew the answer, but she was so proud of herself it was worth the time."</P>

<P>For children who have difficulty in learning to perform a task from beginning to end, you may need to break the task into its component parts and teach each part separately, Then, when your daughter can successfully perform each part, expect her to begin combining the parts. Foster her ability to make these decisions about sequence by asking her, "What's next?" Through your modeling and repetition, she will learn to ask herself "What's next?" Eventually she will be able to perform the task herself, from start to finish.</P>

<P>An essential part of good decision-making is <I>self-awareness</I>. Having insight into what your daughter's strengths and weaknesses are, given her disability and her motivation, will help you to help her in all facets of her life. Her ability, through your help, to assess herself: how she feels, what she believes about herself and others, what she wants in life provides a central point around which to make decisions. Realism, of course, is important in self-appraisal. You can foster your daughter's self-awareness and her ability to make honest self-appraisals by being honest yourself by allowing her to make decisions that require her to identify her preferences and desires, and by engaging her in conversations that lead her to examine herself. It is especially important that your daughter realize her strengths and learn to emphasize them. For example, Debbie, a mother of a six year old daughter with mild retardation, cranial disfigurement, and a speech impediment, replies to her daughter's statements of "I can't do that" by emphasizing what she can do. "Well, maybe now you do have a difficult time doing that, but let's look at what you could do," replies Debbie. Then Debbie proceeds to discuss with her daughter what she can do in that particular instance. Debbie believes it is most important to turn every "I can't" into a conversation of what "I can do."</P>

<P>Rita, whose teenage daughter, Beth, has a learning disability, often talks with her after school about how Beth's day has gone. At times, Rita's questions are quite probing: "Why did you do that?" "How did that make you feel?" "Are you sure you can't do that? Tell me why you think you can't." "Is it because you think you can't do it, or because you just don't want to?" Such questioning serves to make Beth examine her thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and capabilities. These discussions also confirm for Beth the importance and validity of her opinions and give both mother and daughter a greater awareness of what it means to, be Beth.</P>

<P>Another intrinsic part of decision-making is the ability to consider consequences (Clabby &amp; Elias, 1986). Depending on your daughter's disability, this may be more or less difficult. Jose's daughter, who is eight and has been blind since birth, is easily frustrated and loses her temper frequently. When Paula has behaved badly at school, Jose reinforces the teacher's remarks to Paula by demonstrating the consequences of socially unacceptable behavior. Paula is not allowed to phone her friends or have anyone over after school. The consequence of poor behavior is social isolation. Gaye also discusses the consequences of decisions with her teenage daughter who uses a wheelchair. She doesn't tell her daughter what to do; rather, she asks her what options are available, what each option involves in terms of reward and consequence, and, perhaps most importantly, how she feels about each option (requiring that self-awareness discussed above). Based upon the factors involved, her daughter reaches her own decision. Through asking questions and exploring alternatives, Gaye models for her daughter an effective process for making decisions.</P>

<P>Sometimes, making decisions and acting upon them involves taking physical, emotional, or intellectual risks. <B>For parents, allowing their much loved child to take risks is disquieting, even more so when that child is a daughter.</B> "She might get hurt," "She can't protect herself," and "I can't stand to watch her try and fail," are reasons parents of girls commonly give for wanting their daughter to go slow, be careful, and hold back. The problem is, girls then <I>learn</I> to hold back and will "play it safe" in the kinds of decisions they make. This results in self-limiting thinking and behavior.</P>

<P>Teaching your daughter that it's okay to take risks may mean that you have to teach yourself as well, gritting your teeth and crossing your fingers as Roy did when his daughter, a seven year old with a hearing impairment, began negotiating their community alone. "I don't know who was more scared, Helen or me," Roy says. "But she really wanted to try on her own, and I knew it was the only way for her to learn. So l thought, 'Okay, Lord, watch over her.' " Roy laughs. "I have to admit that sometimes I still follow her, just to make sure she's okay." It is, never the less, important for parents to be honest about their concerns and to share them with their daughter. This will help you to confront your concerns and to develop trust in your relationship with your daughter.</P>

<P>Maria, whose 18 year old daughter has a physical disability, with speech and visual problems, needed to come home from a job-site by public transportation. The first day, as the family anxiously awaited her return, she did not. The police were finally called, but Leticia returned home on her own as the police reached the house. As it turned out, Leticia had missed her stop, even though her parents had traveled the route with her beforehand, and had to negotiate her way back on her own. The family was quite upset and Maria's first impulse was to say never again, but Tony, her husband, pointed out how very well Leticia had done on her own; she had shown that she could independently negotiate her way home, which, after all, was the point.</P>

<P>Teaching that it's okay to take a risk involves teaching that it's okay to try and fail. In fact in learning a new skill, even the most adept person generally has many failures on the road to mastery. This is an important message to give your daughter. Understanding that learning may involve repeated attempts to do something before one is successful places initial failures in their proper context and illustrates that immediate success is not essential, but the willingness to try and try again<I> is</I>.</P>

<P>Encourage your daughter to try new things, even if this means she has to struggle and swallow initial failure. Be understanding, too, if she shows a range of emotional reactions. We all have felt the fear, frustration, anger, and occasional despair that can accompany trying something new and difficult. Your daughter is as entitled to these human reactions as any other person. Praise her attempts and honor the courage it takes her to keep on trying. Your encouragement will be a powerful validation of her effort and will reinforce the message that only in striving do we achieve.</P>

<P>In short, whether the decision is a small one, such as what to wear or what to eat, or a far-reaching one, such as what career track to follow, encourage your daughter to identify her preferences and act upon them, even if this means taking a chance and risking failure. In this way, she develops her sense of self and the ability to take action that expresses that self. The skills of decision-making are learned in many ways: modeling, discussion, risk-taking, 
consideration of consequence, and practice. The more decisions you allow her to make, the better equipped she will be to determine her own way in the world outside your home.</P>

<H3><I>A Few Words from Harilyn Rousso</I></H3>

<P><I>One of the myths in our society about disabled women is that we are asexual, incapable of leading socially and sexually fulfilling lives. When I was growing up, my parents and I accepted this myth without question. We simply assumed that because I had a disability, I could not date, find a partner, or have children. As a teenager and young adult, I put aside any hope of a social life and concentrated on my studies.</I></P>

<P><I>It never occurred to me that I had any alternative, that I could have both a career and a romantic life. Betty's lifestyle (another woman wlith a disability), her successful marriage to an interesting, dynamic man made me question for the first time the negative assumptions I had made about my social potential. She planted the seeds of positive possibilities... (Rousso, 1988, p. 2)</I></P>

<H3>Developing a Social World</H3>

<P>The teenage years are critical, exciting, stressful times for all young people, with or without a disability. As your daughter becomes a young woman, you will have many considerations and concerns about her maturing body and her interactions with the world outside your home. School places her in the midst of her peers and provides her with greater opportunities to socialize and discover a self that is separate from the supports of family. Some youth with disabilities may isolate themselves out of self-consciousness, uncertainty, or the fear that no one could really care for them. it's even more important at this time to urge your child gently to seek companions and become involved in events, such as recreation groups, church or extracurricular activities, arts and crafts, or day camps. Adolescents need these social opportunities to explore and develop friendships, to experiment with a variety of social roles, and to experience control over their own lives. Interaction with others with disabilities can be particularly beneficial. Finding that there are others like herself with similar concerns, experiences, and feelings, can help to decrease the sense of isolation and "differentness" your daughter may feel. At the same time, these interactions provide her with an important support network.</P>

<P>The teenage years mark an adolescent's transition into adulthood physically as well as socially. The maturing of your daughter's body brings with it a new host of health concerns. She must learn how to care for and respect herself as a woman. This means your daughter will need:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI> clear discussions about menstruation as a natural event of womanhood;<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> information and training in how to care for herself in this regard; and<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> regular visits to a gynecologist or family doctor.<BR><BR>
	
</UL>

<P>The physical maturing of an adolescent's body is also accompanied by the emergence of sexuality. Many parents react to their adolescent's developing sexuality with alarm, and increase, rather than decrease, their vigilance. This is particularly true when the adolescent is female. Yet, when an adolescent female has a disability, the increased protectiveness of her parents may be accompanied by a tendency to treat her as if she were asexual, still a little girl. This is a common theme in disabled women's literature (Browne, Connors, &amp; Stern, 1985), in which many women with disabilities speak candidly of the difficulties, confusions, and low self-esteem that result from being treated as a nonsexual being when one's internal feelings are quite the opposite.</P>

<P>Thus, parents of a young women with a disability should give serious thought to the messages they send their adolescent daughter about her sexuality. "Some people assume that if you are disabled, you can't have a social life or a sex life. This reflects one's own fears that unless one looks terrific physically, he or she will not be wanted. This is very potent stuff' (Weiner, 1986, p. 72).</P>

<P>Many parents find it difficult to talk frankly with their children about issues of sexuality. This reflects their concern that, should their child's sexuality be acknowledged and nourished, she will be subjected to rejection, abuse, unwanted pregnancy, or veneral disease (Rousso, 1981). However, all adolescents, disabled or otherwise, need reliable information about love, sex, conception, contraception, and veneral disease, in order to prepare for their lives as independent, responsible adults (Buscaglia, 1983). Here are some suggestions for dealing with this stressful time in your daughter's, and your, life.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	
	<LI>Realize that your daughter's physical development will be accompanied by the same sexual feelings and needs that all adolescents feel. You have no more control over the emergence of these feelings than she does.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Don't restrict your daughter's social activities, in the hope that this will negate her sexuality. Restricting her in this way only deprives her of vital physical and mental stimulation.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Be aware that, legally, you will not be your child's guardian forever. This is true no matter the severity of the disability. Although state laws vary, in most states a parent's guardianship, or legal authority over their child, ends when the child is 18.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Sterilization is a difficult subject and a personal choice. Laws vary from state to state, so be aware of them. Most states have followed a recent trend prohibiting involuntary sterilization of individuals, meaning that your daughter must consent to it.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Information and openness regarding sexuality are important for healthy development. Talk about, teach about, and counsel on issues of sexuality and the responsibilities that accompany sexuality. If this is difficult for you, find help; counselors, clergy, parent support groups, Planned Parenthood, and other adults with disabilities are good sources of information.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Have open discussions about sexuality and disability with your daughter Acknowledge the social realities and the fears and uncertainties about their bodies and sexuality that many women with disabilities have. issues of sexuality and disability are complex. But also be reassuring that it is possible to find loving partners; many women with disabilities have successful, intimate relationships and children.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Expose your daughter to positive role models of women with disabilities. Expose her to those who have mature, loving relationships, and family lives. Discuss what is involved in building such relationships. Expose her to women who live alone and who are successful, independent, and self-sufficient.<BR><BR>
	
</UL>

<P>Yes, it's scary to admit that your daughter has sexuality. Frankly, it is difficult for most parents to accept and deal with this in all children, whether or not they have a disability. But "...remember that the disabled have the same needs that you have, to love and be loved, to learn, to share, to grow and to experience, in the same world you live in..." (Buscaglia, 1983, p. 18).</P>

<H3>The Importance of Role Models</H3>

<P>When Harilyn Rousso, who has cerebral palsy, was growing up, she had virtually no contact with other disabled people.</P>

<UL type = circle>
	<LI>I attended a regular school, so l just didn't know anyone else
	who was disabled... it never occurred to me that there could
	be very interesting smart, attractive, witty, and successful
	disabled people. (Brozan, 1984, p. C1)
	
</UL>

<P>Then, when Harilyn Rousso was 22 years old, she met a female economist who also had cerebral palsy. "That association had a profound effect on me,', she said. "I saw that she could make it in a man's field. But I was even more impressed that she was married... That woman made me challenge my assumptions about myself' (Brozan, 1984, p. C1, C11).</P>

<P>What happened to Harilyn Rousso illustrates how important it is that our children with disabilities are exposed to positive role models: others with disabilities who have successfully challenged the stereotypes of disability and their own limitations. Role models can be actual people: teachers, family members, workers in the community. Or they can be images that appear in books, posters, games, and the media. Seeing adults functioning in a wide variety of roles lets all children, and particularly those with disabilities, know that it is possible to grow up, work, love, parent, and lead independent lives.</P>

<P>Families and professionals learn just as much from being around people with disabilities. Mike, whose daughter was deaf, was very protective and openly stated that he did not believe his daughter would ever be on her own. Luckily for his daughter, a woman who is deaf was hired to work in his office. Mike saw how competent and self-sufficient she was. This experience completely altered his expectations for his daughter. He is now his daughter's greatest advocate for her independence and self-sufficiency.</P>

<P>Until recently, there has been an almost total absence of positive role models for girls and women with disabilities. This has had a profound effect on their self-image and sense of future. As one woman who is deaf states, "l used to believe that when I graduated I'd die or live with my family forever. That was because I'd never met a deaf woman" (O'Toole, 1979). Luckily, due to the pioneering efforts of women such as Harilyn Rousso, there are many resources currently emerging on video, in print, and in the form of organizations, that offer girls and women with disabilities the opportunity to learn what others like themselves have experienced and achieved.</P>

<P>As a parent, you can build your daughter's self-esteem and sense of her own possibilities by exposing her to positive role models of women
with disabilities. Here are some suggestions for action</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> From early childhood onward, seek out women with disabilities in your community who are working, raising families, and doing all the things that women do. These women are no longer invisible. Invite them to your child's school, or arrange for your daughter to meet with these women and talk. At the very least, point them out to your daughter.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Acquaint your child with the world of work. When friends visit, tell your daughter what type of job he or she has. Ask your daughter if she would like to ask your friend about what the job entails. Do this in a way that conveys that many career paths are open to her.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Be sure that the school or program your daughter attends has a good selection of learning materials that represent people with disabilities in positive ways. Check to see that they are not presented in stereotypical female and male roles. Also make sure that they represent diverse racial and ethnic groups. Become active in helping your child's teacher locate resources. The latter is most important, for you can be a tremendous asset to your child's teacher in this area.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Find the resources listed at the end of this NEWS DIGEST and share them with your daughter. These and other resources such as your local library, independent living centers, and disability rights organizations, will expose your daughter (and you, too!) to books, plays, films, and television programs that portray positive images of people with disabilities. They will also help your child explore her options for education, independence, sexuality, work, and family life by providing role models of other women with disabilities who have successfully addressed these issues in their own lives.<BR><BR>

<H3>Confronting the World of School and Work</H3>

<P>Three federal laws require the provision of sex equitable education to students with disabilities. These laws are Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. On the basis of these laws, your daughter cannot be denied special education, related services, or vocational education. (You can obtain more information about these laws by contacting NICHCY.)</P>

<P>Our educational system can represent one of the greatest vehicles for self-empowerment that your daughter has at her disposal, because, through schooling, she can equip herself with the knowledge and skills needed to achieve independence and self-sufficiency. As has been discussed, however, inequities can occur in the provision of services, due to expectations regarding the roles of males and females in society in general and, more specifically, the capabilities of a female with a disability. Therefore, parents must be committed to securing the best, most appropriate education for their daughter, and vigilant that she does not receive guidance or instruction that unnecessarily limits her development along sex-biased and stereotyped lines.</P>

<P>Here are some suggestions for working within the educational system to ensure that your daughter receives an education that develops her intellectual, social, and physical capabilities without limiting her future.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	
	<LI> <B>Be involved.</B> Talk to your child's teachers and other school personnel. Make the effort to be present at all meetings to discuss IEPs developed for your daughter, and share any special concerns, ambitions, or disagreements that you have. Remember, you are experts, too; you know a great deal about your child, and are an important member of the team. Let them know that you expect her to achieve, and work with the school, especially her counselors and teachers, to make sure she is in programs that foster this.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI><B> Be aware.</B> Find out what your daughter is learning in class and how you can support this learning at home.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI><B>Be supportive.</B> Let your daughter be involved in extracurricular activities. Social contact with peers is a vital part of growing up and learning to be independent.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> <B>Be knowledgeable.</B> Know your rights and the opportunities available in the school and county. Work with the school system to assure that an appropriate education and- services are being provided for your daughter, taking into consideration both her needs and her ambitions. For example, if she plans to go to college, make sure she takes the required courses for entrance; if she needs job training, make sure vocational training is in her IEP. Counselors are a good resource and are available for consultation regarding tests, applications, and services after high school.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> <B>Be an advocate.</B> If you detect a problem in the provision of services, confront it. "It's amazing how people respond to you when you are prepared, committed to listening, not attacking them, and determined to get what you feel your child needs" (Weiner, 1986, p. 109). Talk with other parents of children with disabilities. By combining your forces, when and where necessary, you can effect change in your school system and community regarding sexual stereotyping and awareness.<BR><BR>
	
</UL>

<P>As your child matures, the world of work becomes an increasing concern. Regardless of the nature of your daughter's disability, actively pursue employment as a goal for her. Do not think this is unreasonable. Gay Tompkins, a teacher in Arlington County, Virginia, who teaches children with disabilities ranging from mild to quite severe, reports that, in her program, "We expect every child, no matter how disabled, to have a job someday." This is true in classrooms across the nation. For some, attaining this goal may require support and appropriate accommodation, am approach known as partial participation, partial assistance. For all, however, securing the goal of employment requires the expectation and involvement of significant caregivers. "Work makes a vast qualitative difference in the lives of disabled Americans," report Harris and Associates (1987, p. 2). "Comparisons between working and nonworking disabled people show that those who work are more satisfied with life, much less likely to consider themselves disabled, and much less likely to say that their disability has prevented them from reaching their full abilities as a person" (Harris and Associates, 1987, p. 2).</P>

<P>In determining a career path for your daughter to follow, you may need to set aside certain work or status expectations you have for your daughter and examine the ideas you hold about what is acceptable work. A statement such as "I'm not going to let her go into social work. She's going to study computers, that's where the future is!" reveals what parents want for their child, and denies what the child may want for herself. Similarly, proclamations such as "Fold laundry? Not my child! She'll stay at home with us first!" reflect the belief that certain types of work are unacceptable. Before parents can summarily reject a type of work as inappropriate for their child, a realistic assessment of the child's strengths and weaknesses must be made. Moreover, each child is an individual with her own personality, preferences, and desires. What she can do and what she wants to do should be the primary considerations for determining what she will do, not whether the parents feel a certain type of employment measures up to their expectations or is "acceptable" for their child.</P>

<P>Career planning is typically developed in conjunction with the school system.  Whether your daughter is placed in a vocational training program or pursues academic training is a decision reached through discussion with teachers, counselors, therapists, and you, the parent. Don't allow your daughter to have false limits set for her because she is a female or because she has a disability. Don't you set false limits, either. As Mitchell (1982) states, "The biggest career development problem for children with disabilities is the low expectation society (school, government, family) has for adults with disabilities" (p. 57).</P>

<P>Receiving training, vocational or academic, is essential if your daughter is going to achieve any measure of independence and self-sufficiency. Parents should be deeply involved in the process of planning what training their daughter will receive. Here are some suggestions for confronting the complexities of career development.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI> Know what type of career training your school system is planning to give your daughter. Go to all meetings where this is discussed. Find out whether their plan has taken into account what her interests and potential are. If not, insist that an assessment of her interests and aptitudes be made.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Don't let doors be closed to your daughter. Protect her, when appropriate, from the "norms" of the educational system, which, for her, may be a trap. For example, Claire knew that because of her daughter's learning disability she did not do well on tests and that it would be difficult for her to score well on the SATs even though there are provisions for time extensions for people with disabilities. Thus, she did not allow her daughter to take these exams, recognizing that to do so might close college doors to her and have an adverse effect on her self-esteem. Believing that her daughter could succeed in college, she enrolled her daughter in a junior college that did not require SAT scores for admission, thereby letting Sue prove that she could do the academic work despite her disability. Now, Sue is entering her senior year at a major university and will graduate with a degree in human ecology.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Know what types of vocational and academic training are available and your daughter's rights to receive this training. (Contact NICHCY for more information.)<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Teach your daughter to be an advocate for herself. In order to be able to do this, the young woman must be self-aware, confident, and know how to set limits. This must be worked on in the home and at school. If possible, let her attend seminars, workshops, and classes where she can learn how to present herself to prospective employers. She also needs to know the fundamentals of effective communication. She should be able to communicate her capabilities, disabilities, and what types of accommodations her disability requires. Mary Beth, who is 20, has a learning disability. She learned during her first year in a junior college to be candid with teachers, counselors, and friends regarding her disability. She is now transferring that skill to job interviews. She tries to be clear about what she does well, what she cannot do, and what she can do with a little extra time.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Discuss with school professionals how many males and females are in various vocational programs and discuss the variety of options available to your daughter and how she might gain access to the programs. Don't be put off by comments such as "most of our girls go into..." or "...is a good job for a girl." Ask about job training opportunities and job placement and ask if the school has information on its graduates, in term of employment, wages, and benefits. Do this early in her high school program.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> What does your daughter want? Defend her right to pursue her own goals! This may mean that you, too, must go against your own wishes, as Suzanne, the mother of a 24 year old daughter with autism, had to do. Suzanne wanted her daughter, Valerie, to enter a computer training program. Although Valerie was tested as able to do the necessary computer work, she was intent on having a job folding laundry. After much discussion, Suzanne accepted Valerie's decision. This is the essence of allowing one's child to be self-determining. Suzanne realized that there was a good probability that once she has gained confidence in her ability to work, she might want to enter a new field.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Don't let another person's ideas of what is "realistic" for your daughter be your ideas. As Mitchell (1982) says, "Telling any minority group to be realistic is telling them to buy the prejudices of our society" (p, 69). There are quite a few women with disabilities who ignored the advice of guidance counselors to be "realistic and adjust" to their handicap and who have gone on to become successful scientists, lawyers, and social activists. Phyllis Rubenfeld is one such individual. Told by the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation that they would not sponsor her training in social work because her physical disability did not allow her to jump, she pressed for her rights to pursue her own career preference and won. Today she has a doctorate in education (Weiner, 1986).<BR><BR>

	<LI> Bring your daughter in contact with other women with disabilities who can serve as role models. This may have to be through the media of print or video, if you cannot provide in-person meetings. (Some resources for this type of information are listed at the end of this NEWS DIGEST.)<BR><BR>
	
</UL>

<P>There have been many changes in recent years that are forcing society to reevaluate the way it views the work potential of people with disabilities. For example, <B>rather than seeing the person as unemployable because he or she has a mobility impairment and uses a wheelchair, society has become aware that the deficit, in fact, exists in the <I>architecture</I> of buildings which does not permit the person to enter.</B> Federal law, including the recently passed Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, requires employers who receive federal funds to make "reasonable accommodations" for a person with a disability. New technologies, such as sound-activated computers, are enhancing the work possibilities for persons with all types of disabilities (President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, 1986). individuals committed to improving the status and opportunities of persons with severe disabilities have developed possibilities for supported employment, which emphasizes a "place and train" approach, rather than the "train and place" sequence used in vocational programs (Gardner, Chapman, Donaldson, &amp; Jacob-son, 1988). All these changes expand the horizon of job possibilities for your daughter, no matter the severity of her disability.</P>

<H3>Summary</H3>

<P>The seeds of future independence, self-sufficiency, and productive employment are planted at home with the messages you give, consciously or unconsciously, to your daughter from the time she is born. As she grows, encourage her to achieve whatever she is capable of achieving. Teach her to value her own ideas, desires, and preferences. Solicit her input. Give her responsibilities in the house and teach her how to execute them. Also let her know that she, too, belongs in the world that exists outside of your door: the social world where people talk to and care about one another, and the world of work, which people begin preparing for in a myriad of ways long before they are actually employed. Does she believe that the social and work worlds are waiting for her? Tell her that they are. Prepare her for these worlds and her own place in them by encouraging her to take risks and to make decisions for herself. Help her to develop skills that will permit her to function in the work world and the community. Be her advocate in school matters and in career planning, and teach her to be her own advocate. And show her that other women with disabilities of all sorts have achieved their own independence, emotional wellbeing, and economic self-sufficiency through aspiring to develop the capabilities they have and not letting others limit their own sense of possibility. There is no denying that your attitudes and your expectations today and along the way will powerfully influence her own attitudes and expectations and, ultimately, her achievements.</P>

<H3>Bibliography</H3>

<P>An increasing number of women with disabilities are becoming more vocal within both the disability rights and women's movements. This activism is reflected in many of the listings provided in this bibliography, as well as in the references cited throughout this NEWS DIGEST.</P>

<P>The growth in resources for, by, and about women with disabilities is heartening for parents and professionals, but, most of all, for women and girls who see themselves reflected in literature and research.</P>

<P>The following resources are selective. They reflect the experiences and perspectives of women and girls with disabilities. Included are books for children, books for older readers, educational materials for parents and professional, videos and films, and organizations that address many of the issues discussed in this NEWS DIGEST. The cited references are also recommended reading to add to your knowledge about women and disability.</P>

<B>Children's Books</B>

<P>Greenfield, Eloise, illustrated by George Ford. (1980).<I> Darlene</I>. New York: Methuen.</P>

<P>In this book a young girl named Darlene, who uses a wheelchair, is feeling homesick while spending a morning with her uncle and cousin. Darlene resists her cousin's attempts to play with her, but finally becomes absorbed in games and in her uncle's guitar playing. In typical fashion, when Darlene's mother arrives, Darlene doesn't want to go home. Darlene is outstanding because the child's disability is secondary to the plot; it shows a positive view of a Black family, and has a male caregiver as a main character. (Appropriate for grade pre-K to 2.)</P>

<P>Head, Barry &amp; Seguin, Jim, designed by Frank Dastolfo, photographed by Walter Seng. (1975). <I>Who am I?</I> Northbrook, IL: Hubbard.</P>

<P>This book shows a girl who is hearing impaired playing, loving her family, and learning. The words "Who am l?" are the only ones in the book, and they appear periodically. The full color photo illustrations are nonsexist, multiracial, and inclusive. The book is part of the "l Am, l Can, l Will" set of materials created by Mr. Rogers but is available separately. (Appropriate for grades Pre-K to 4.)</P>

<P>Henriod, Lorraine, illustrated by Christa Chevalier. (1982). <I>Grandma's wheelchair</I>. Chicago: Albert Whitman and Co.</P>

<P>A book about the fond relationship between grandma and her four-year-old grandson, Thomas. Grandma uses a wheelchair, and Thomas spends time riding in her lap while they do things together. Grandma is depicted as a capable homemaker, taking an active role in the running of her house. Information regarding wheelchair use is integral to the story. (Appropriate for grades Pre-K to 1.)</P>

<P>Sargent, Susan Wirt &amp; Donna Aaron, illustrated by Allan Eitzen. (1983). <I>My favorite place</I>. Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press.</P>

<P>This story is full of the multisensory experiences of a child's trip to the ocean. It is not until the end that the reader finds out that the girl in the story is blind. My Favorite Place helps young children understand the use of the senses other than vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. The child is shown actively swimming in the ocean and running from the waves. (Appropriate for grades Pre-K to 1.)</P>

<B>Books For Older Readers</B>

<P>Garrigue, Sheila. (1978). <I>Between friends</I>. New York: Bradbury Press.</P>

<P>Sixth-grader Jill moves into her new neighborhood in August when most of the neighborhood children are still away. Only Dede is at home, but Dede is "different." She has Down Syndrome. Dede has a dog, and Jill is taking care of a neighbor's dog. The two girls walk the dogs together, and their friendship blossoms until the rest of the neighborhood girls return from vacation. Then Jill has to make some important decisions about how to maintain her friendship with Dede as well as build friendships with the other children. Jill learns that loyalty and caring are what make a friendship grow. (Appropriate for grades 3-6.)</P>

<P>Greenfield, Eloise &amp; Revis, <I>Alesia</I>, illustrated by George Ford, photographs by Sandra Turner Bond. (1981). Alesia. New York: Philomel Books/Putnam.</P>

<P>This is a story of a young Black woman who becomes mobility impaired as a result of an accident. She is portrayed as a whole person with varied interests and feelings. The pictures and photographs reflect many of Alesia's friends and activities, and her family is supportive and caring. It is rare to find truly positive literature about an individual who is disabled and even more rare to find such works about a person of color who is disabled. Alesia is such a rare find. (Appropriate for grades 5 and up.)</P>

<P>Kent, Deborah. (1978). <I>Belonging</I>. New York: Dial Press. (Available in braille and as a talking book from the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, The Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20542. Telephone: (202) 707-5100.)</P>

<P>In this story, a girl who is blind is the first and only student with a disability in a suburban high school. This book has been a favorite with many adolescents and adults with and without disabilities, for it recalls vividly the difficulties encountered by trying to establish a genuine sense of belonging. (Appropriate for grades 6 and up.)</P>

<P>Sachs, Ann. (1981). <I>Just like always</I>. New York: Antheneum.</P>

<P>Janie and Courtney have similar disabilities (scoliosis) and must cope with a prolonged hospital stay. The two girls are very different. Janie is outspoken, mischievous, always questioning the arbitrary hospital rules and exploring limits. Courtney, a shy, quiet girl, "has always been a model patient" and lives in a fantasy world. It is through the very different personalities of the two girls that the reader subtly realizes that individuals with the same disabilities are just that, individuals. The story takes place in the hospital and does dwell more on hospital routines, personalities, and insensitivities than on disability. (Appropriate for grades 4-7.)</P>

<P>Walker, Lou Ann, photographs by Michael Abramson. (1985). <I>Amy: The story of a deaf child</I>. New York: E.P. Dutton.</P>

<P>Amy Rowley, who is deaf, loves to climb trees, swim, read, and watch movies, She is learning to skateboard and is the fastest runner of the girls in her class. This photo essay, told in Amy's own words, shows an active child and provides the reader with much information about how people who are hearing impaired do many things, e.g.. talk on the telephone via a TDD or know that the doorbell is ringing through a series of flashing lights. (Appropriate for grades 3-6.)</P>

<p>Increasing numbers of students with learning disabilities are enrolling in two- and four-year colleges and universities. Since 1985, among first-time, full-time freshmen who reported having any disability, the percentage of those with learning disabilities doubled from 15 percent to 32 percent.</p>

<p>Currently nearly a third of all freshmen with disabilities report having learning disabilities.
Some of the most frequently asked questions of the HEATH staff are about students with learning disabilities who are preparing to make the transition from high school to college. In addition, HEATH staff are asked many questions by students with learning disabilities who plan to enroll in graduate school, including law school and medical school. Such questions indicate that students with learning disabilities can, and do have successful undergraduate experiences. High school students with learning disabilities who are considering going to college should be
encouraged to pursue this goal. </p>

<p>Students should be aware that colleges and universities are not all alike. Their missions or purposes, entrance criteria, programs of study, and requirements for certifications, associate degrees, and baccalaureate degrees vary. Similarly, students with learning disabilities are not all alike. Their goals, strengths and weaknesses vary. Also, people change their minds-plans and goals change over time. The student who enrolls in a vocational certification program in a two-year community college today may be the student who completes a baccalaureate degree program in a four-year university tomorrow.</p>
 
<p>Students with learning disabilities, who will choose to continue their formal education beyond high school, need to take a variety of preparatory steps to get ready for college while in high school. In addition, they need to make real choices regarding their goals after high school well before their senior years to maximize their options.</p>

<p>This paper was developed to help in that process by answering many of the questions that students have, and listing sources of additional information. While Getting Ready for College was designed for high school students with learning disabilities, this paper should also be useful to those who advise students in their college-search process, including parents, teachers, and guidance counselors. Unless otherwise specified, information in this Resource Paper is based on the writers' participation in numerous workshops and national conferences, materials collected by HEATH staff, and conversations with successful college students with disabilities, as well as experienced campus Disability Support Services officers. Additional information can be obtained by contacting the organizations or consulting the publications included in the Selected Resources section at the end of this paper. The following ideas will be explored within this paper: </p>

<H3>Developing Self Knowledge</H3>

<p>Successful college students with learning disabilities, college advisors, as well as campus Disability Support Services staff agree that developing knowledge about one's self -- the nature of one's learning disabilities as well as one's personal and academic strengths and weaknesses -- is vital in getting ready for college.</p>
 
<p>Students need to become familiar with how they learn best. Many successful students with learning disabilities acquire compensatory learning strategies to help them use the knowledge they have accumulated, to plan, complete and evaluate projects, and to take an active role in shaping their environments. They need to learn how to apply strategies flexibly, and how to modify or create strategies fluently to fit new learning situations. For example, compensatory strategies may include:
<br><br>

<ul><li>allowing more time to complete tests, papers, and other projects,
<li>listening to audio tapes of text books while reading, 
<li>making up words to remind students to use the knowledge they have.
</ul>
 
<p>For example: </p>

<ul><li>
F.O.I.L. (First Outer Inner Last) to remember the sequence of steps in solving algebra problems when in school,
<li>P.A.L. (Practice Alert Listening) when talking with friends and family, at work, and in school, or 
<li>U.S.E. (Use Strategies Every	day).
</ul>

<p>All students learn from experience. Those with learning disabilities need to exercise their judgment, make mistakes, self-identify them, and correct them. Learning new information in a new setting, such as a college classroom or dormitory, can be frustrating. Set-backs are an inevitable part of the learning process, but can impair self-esteem, which is essential to taking responsibility for one's life. Self- esteem is built and rebuilt one day at a time. Students need explicit strategies to monitor and restore their self-esteem. </p>
 
<p>Some students have difficulty understanding or making themselves understood by their peers, families, and instructors. For example, some learning disabilities may affect timing in conversations, or decisions about when to study and when to socialize. Students need to really think about how motivated they are.
</p>
<p> They should ask themselves these questions:
<ul>
<li>Do I really want to go to college and work harder than I ever did before?
<li>Am I really ready to manage my social life?
</ul>

<p>In order to gain self knowledge, HEATH staff suggest the following ideas:
Become familiar with one's own learning disability. Since the professional documentation of the learning disability is the vehicle for understanding one's strengths and weaknesses it is essential that each student has a full and frank discussion about that documentation with his or her parents as well as the psychologist or other expert who assessed the student. Students may want to ask questions such as:</p>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>		What is the extent of the disability?<BR><BR>
	<LI>		What are my strengths? How do I learn best?<BR><BR>
	<LI>		Are there strategies that I can use to learn despite these disabilities?<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>[Note: See discussion on page 5 about Documentation of a Learning Disability,]
Learn to be "self-advocates" while still in high school! Self-advocates are people who can speak up in logical, clear and positive language to communicate about their needs. Self-advocates take responsibility for themselves. To be a self-advocate, each student must learn to understand his or her particular type of learning disability, and the resultant academic strengths and weaknesses. They must be aware of their own learning styles. Most importantly, high school students with learning disabilities need to become comfortable with describing to others both their disability and their academic-related needs. At the college level, the student alone will hold the responsibility for self-identification and advocacy. </P>
<P>Practice self-advocacy while still in high school. Many students with learning disabilities develop self-advocacy skills through participating in the discussions to determine the Individualized Education Program (IEP) and/or the Individualized Transition Plan (ITP). Armed with knowledge about learning strengths and weaknesses, the student can be a valued member of the planning team.</P>
<P>Develop strengths and learn about areas of interest. Students with learning disabilities, as do others, often participate in sports, music, or social activities after school. Others try working in a variety of jobs or community volunteer projects. Activities in which a student can excel can help to build the self-esteem necessary to succeed in other areas.</P>

<a name="Understanding"></a>
<H3>Understanding Legal Rights and Responsibilities</H3>
<H4>IDEA, Section 504, and ADA</H4>
<P>Recent legislation protects the rights of people with disabilities. In order to be effective self-advocates, students need to be informed about this legislation. It is especially important to know about the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (especially Section 504), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and how they differ from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) of 1990. In addition the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 protects the confidentiality of student records, which is very important for students with learning disabilities and their families to understand.</P>

<H4>Understanding the Differences</H4>
<P>High school students with learning disabilities must understand their rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (which guarantee the civil rights of persons with disabilities) and how these differ from the rights and services they received under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).</P>
<P>Under IDEA, which is the legislation that guarantees a free appropriate public education and governs the provision of special education services to students with disabilities in elementary and secondary schools, the school is responsible for identifying students with disabilities, for providing all necessary assessments, and for monitoring the provision of special education services. These special education services, which are described in detail in a student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) and Individualized Transition Plan (ITP), could significantly alter the requirements of the "standard" high school academic program. Re-quirements for high school diplomas may be changed under IDEA, as well. For example, dependent on their particular disabilities, some students' programs of study under IDEA may not include certain language, mathematics, or science courses that are usually required courses for a diploma.</P>
<P>However, IDEA does not apply to higher education. Colleges and universities do not offer "special" education. Under Section 504 and the ADA, colleges and universities are prohibited from discriminating against a person because of disability. Institutions must provide reasonable modifications, accommodations, or auxiliary aids which will enable qualified students to have access to, participate in, and benefit from the full range of the educational programs and activities which are offered to all students on campus. Examples which may assist students with learning disabilities include, but are not limited to, the use of readers, notetakers, extra time to complete exams, and/or alternate test formats.</P>
<P>Decisions regarding the exact accommodations to be provided are made on an individualized basis, and the college or university has the flexibility to select the specific aid or service it provides, as long as it is effective. Colleges and universities are not required by law to provide aides, services, or devices for personal use or study.</P>
<P>Unlike elementary and secondary schools, postsecondary institutions are not required to design special academic programs for students with disabilities. Postsecondary institutions are required to provide accommodative services so that qualified students with disabilities will have equal access to the regular academic program. After equal access is provided, it is everyone's own responsibility to do well, or not do well. Section 504 and the ADA do not require postsecondary institutions to alter their requirements for either admissions or for graduation.</P>


<H4>Understanding the Changes in Level of Responsibility</H4>
<P>Students with learning disabilities need to know that the level of responsibility regarding the provision of services changes after high school. As mentioned above, throughout the elementary and secondary years, it is the responsibility of the school system to identify students with disabilities and to initiate the delivery of special education services. However, while Section 504 and the ADA require postsecondary institutions to provide accommodative services to students with disabilities, once the student has been admitted to a college or university it is the student's responsibility to self-identify and provide documentation of the disability. The college or university will not provide any accommodation until a student takes the following two steps:
&bull; Step 1. The enrolled student who needs accommodative services must "self-identify." That means he or she must go to the Office of Disability Support Services, or the office (or person) on campus responsible for providing services to students with disabilities, and request services.
&bull; Step 2. He or she must provide documentation of his or her disability. For the student with a learning disability, such documentation is often a copy of his or her testing report and/or a copy of the IEP or ITP. </P>


<H4>Understanding Your Rights to Privacy</H4>
<P>Students and their families are often concerned about who will be able to see their educational records. They want to be sure that written records will be confidential and available only to those with a legitimate interest in them. To protect the privacy of student records the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) was passed in 1974 and later amended several times. FERPA is also known as the Buckley Amendment in recognition of Senator James Buckley of New York who introduced it. </P>
<P>FERPA gives students the right to have access to their educational records, consent to release a record to a third party, challenge information in those records, and be notified of their privacy rights. FERPA affects all colleges and universities which receive federal funds. FERPA rights belong to the student regardless of age (and to the parents of a dependent student - as defined by the Internal Revenue Service). A "student" is a person who attends college or university and/or for whom the institution maintains educational records (former students and alumni, for example) but not applicants to the institution or those denied admission. The college must inform students of their FERPA rights, procedures to allow a student access to his or her record, and procedures to consent to release a record to a third party. Publishing this information in a catalogue or bulletin satisfies this requirement.
FERPA protects a student's record from being shared (without the student's permission) with "curious" faculty, administrators, other students, the press, or anyone without a legitimate reason for seeing the record.
According to Subpart E: The Impact of Section 504 on Postsecondary Education, a publication of the Association on Higher Education and Disability - AHEAD (see Selected Resources section) the following information is provided about confidentiality.</P>
<P>Any information regarding disability gained from medical examinations or appropriate post-admissions inquiry shall be considered confidential and shall be shared with others within the institution on a need-to-know basis only. In other words, other individuals shall have access to disability-related information only in-so-far as it impacts on their functioning or involvement with that individual.</P>
<P>For example, faculty members do not have a right or a need to access diagnostic or other information regarding a student's disability. They only need to know what accommodations are necessary/ appropriate to meet the student's disability-related needs, and then only with permission of the
student.</P>
<P>Disability-related information should be kept in separate files with access limited to appropriate personnel. Documentation of disability should be held by a single source within the institution in order to protect the confidentiality of persons with disabilities by assuring such limited access.

<a name="Transition"></a>
<H3>Transition Planning For College</H3>
<P>Leaving high school is an eventuality that all students face. Under the IDEA preparing for this transition has been formalized by requiring that the IEP for each student receiving special education services include a statement of the transition services needed. In many locations the IEP becomes an Individualized Transition Plan, or ITP. It documents the student's disabilities, describes specific courses for the student to take, accommodative services for the school to provide, notes post-high school plans, and identifies linkages with relevant community agencies, such as Vocational Rehabilitation Services. Students with learning disabilities planning to go to college are encouraged to take an active part in the transition planning process. Of particular importance in transition planning are the following:</P>

<H4>College Options</H4>
<P>Students with learning disabilities who are planning to go to college should make themselves aware of the general categories of postsecondary educational institutions. Knowing the type of college one will attend affects the student's course selections while still in high school. There are over 3,000 colleges and universities in the United States. In addition to varying in size, scope of program offered, setting (urban, suburban, or rural), residential or commuter, and cost of attendance, there are several factors of special importance for students with learning disabilities.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B><I>Admissions Criteria:</I></B><BR>
Some colleges have open admissions. These colleges admit anyone over age 18 or with a high school diploma. At some colleges with open admissions, however, alternate diplomas or certificates of completion may not be acceptable for admission. Students must check with the college to be sure that the earned high school completion document will meet admissions criteria. Standardized college admissions testing is not required at open admissions colleges, nor is any particular high school course selection. Grades in high school are not relevant. Open admissions colleges may be two-year or four-year. They usually do require students to take a "placement exam" to determine at which level to begin college course work. Students who have not taken an academic preparatory program in high school may need to complete some high school level courses before taking college courses for credit toward a college degree. Such courses are usually available as remedial courses and may be taken at the college.
Other colleges have selective admissions requirements. Applicants to selective colleges must meet the criteria set by that particular college. Schools with selective criteria may look for students with high grade point averages, rigorous academic preparation, high scores on the standardized college admissions tests, and strong personal qualities and evidence of achievement. Some colleges are more selective than others. Some standard, commercially available college guides list colleges by the degree of selectivity, or "how hard it is to get in" - from "most difficult" to "minimally difficult." Selective colleges may require applicants to submit high school grade point average and rank in class, scores on standardized admissions tests (SAT or ACT), and letters of recommendation. Some may require a personal interview, and some may be particularly interested in the student's extracurricular activities.<BR><BR>
 
<LI><B><I>Types of Institutions:</I></B> <BR>
Two-year colleges are most frequently public community colleges located in urban, suburban, and rural areas across the United States. Most are open admissions institutions and are non-residential. Some are independent (private) junior colleges which encourage students to earn an Associate Degree. Community colleges attract students who choose to take either a few selected courses in their interest area, vocational courses to train for specific jobs, as well as those who pursue an undergraduate certificate (to study a specific field of training), or an Associate Degree, some of whom plan to transfer to a four-year institution. <BR><BR>
Four-year colleges or universities may be open enrollment or selective. Most require students to pursue a degree, and many are residential. Four-year colleges are also located in various settings, and in small communities they may be the center of cultural life. Tuition, room, board, and books are generally more expensive per year than the cost of attendance at a community college.<BR><BR>
Colleges with programs for students with learning disabilities:  Hundreds of colleges and universities have comprehensive programs on campus specially designed for students with learning disabilities. Staffed by individuals trained in the area of learning disabilities, these programs offer - in addition to the standard services offered by the campus as a whole - services that go above and beyond making a program accessible. Examples include tutoring services, either in students' coursework or in general areas of deficit, such as study skills, organizational skills, or time management. Counseling services may also be provided - personal, academic, or vocational. As the services provided in such programs do go above and beyond those that the college or university is required to provide under Section 504 and ADA, many colleges and universities charge for these services above the tuition fee. (Services required by Section 504 and ADA are provided at no cost to the student). 
It is also possible that such programs have their own separate admissions requirements. Students who wish to learn more about such programs should either call each of the colleges and universities that they are interested in and ask if such a program exists on campus, or check one of the many guidebooks found in public libraries and bookstores that contain listings of, and information about, such programs. (See the Selected Resources section of this paper for further information about such guidebooks.)<BR><BR>
</UL>

<H4>Documentation of a Learning Disability</H4>
<P>A high school student with a learning disability is one who has been evaluated by professionals. Such professionals (a school psychologist or educational diagnostician), after reviewing the results of various tests and other evidence, provide for each student a written diagnosis that a learning disability exists. Recommendations for accommodative services and programs are also usually part of the written document. This document can serve as a vehicle for the student to understand his or her strengths and weaknesses, as well as a "ticket" to obtain the accommodative  services necessary to participate in regular college programs. There are several points for a student planning to go to college to keep in mind concerning the documentation of a learning disability:
 IDEA requires reevaluations to be conducted at least every three years, therefore, students with learning disabilities may be wise to have a comprehensive reevaluation conducted close to high school graduation time. This will ensure, for students who are going directly into postsecondary education, that the documentation that they take with them will be timely.
 If the student is unable to be evaluated close to graduation from high school, it is possible that a college or university, after receiving documentation, may decide that the documentation is too old. This may occur if the college or university feels that the information does not adequately describe the student's current academic strengths and weaknesses, learning styles, etc. Such current information can be invaluable in determining the most appropriate accommodations for the student. While an agreed upon definition does not exist within the postsecondary/disability community of "how old is too old," evidence from the field suggests a range of two-five years. While it is ultimately the student's responsibility to obtain necessary documentation, some colleges and universities do provide testing services. Students should ask about campus-based possibilities before going to a private diagnostician.
 Students and parents should study and discuss the documentation in order to fully understand what it conveys about the student's strengths, weaknesses, and recommended accommodative services. If the report is not clear, discuss it with the school psychologist or whoever has prepared it.
 Many high schools routinely destroy copies of student records after a predetermined number of years. As students with learning disabilities will need copies of select items in their records to show to the college or university as documentation of their disability, students should make sure that they have complete copies of all of their records upon leaving high school.</P>


<H4>Course Selection and Accommodative Services</H4>
<P>Students with learning disabilities should consider various college options as well as their academic strengths and weaknesses in planning their high school program. Students seeking admission to selective institutions MUST meet the criteria set by the college. Students planning to attend a non-selective college should check to see if the high school diploma or certificate of attendance meets the entrance criteria.</P>
<P>Successful college students with learning disabilities report that high school courses teaching keyboard skills and word processing are especially important. A high school transcript displaying successful completion of a wide array of courses (science, math, history, literature, foreign language, art, music) are attractive to selective college admissions staff. Involvement in school or community sponsored clubs, teams, or performances also enhance a college admission candidate's application.</P>
<P>Students interested in any of the emerging technical careers should explore the tech-prep programs available in many areas. Such tech-prep programs include a partnership between secondary vocational-technical schools and postsecondary institutions - most often community colleges. These tech-prep programs help people prepare for careers in such areas as engineering technology; applied science; mechanical, industrial, practical art, or trade; or agriculture; health; or business. They offer both classroom instruction and practical work-based experience. </P>
<P>Accommodative services are essential to the success of many students with learning disabilities. Prior to the ITP meeting at which the services will be listed, students should try out various accommodations which have proven successful to others. These may include:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> listening to a tape recording of written material while reading it,
	<LI> using extended time to complete exams (usually time and a half),
	<LI> using a computer to write out exams or papers,
	<LI> taking the exam in a quiet place without distraction of other students or intrusive noises.<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>In addition, students with learning disabilities may benefit from mini-courses in study skills, assertiveness training, and time management. The importance of listing the accommodative services for each student in the ITP cannot be emphasized strongly enough. The types of accommodations students may receive when taking standardized college admissions tests or licensing examinations may depend on the evidence of having received them in high school.</P>

<hr>

<a name="College"></a>
<H3>College Application Process</H3>
<P>For students with learning disabilities to assume responsibility for college application processes, they need to have an accurate idea of what they have to offer colleges. They also need to have an accurate idea of the academic requirements and admission procedures of the colleges or universities in which they are interested. Successful college students with learning disabilities advise that the actual college application process should begin as early as possible - in one's high school junior year. That is the time to review the documentation of the learning disabilities and work on understanding strengths, weaknesses, learning styles, and accommodative services. In addition, the following activities are part of the process and will be discussed in this section.</P>

<H4>Creating a Short List</H4>
<P>The staff of the HEATH Resource Center are often asked for a list of colleges or universities that are best for students with learning disabilities. Our answer is always the same -  HEATH does not compile such a list because different schools are better for different students for different reasons. HEATH staff do go on to suggest the following:</P>

<P>* First, the student, parents, and anyone else that is important to the college-search process should make a short list of six to ten schools that the student is interested in. The key at this point is to temporarily set aside any disability-related concerns. Create the short-list according to all other factors that are important, just as any student going through the college-search process might. These factors may include: components of various academic programs offered, admissions-related requirements, cost, opportunities for financial aid, location, community resources, athletics, social activities, as well as others. The reason for putting disability-related concerns aside at this point is that, under Section 504 and the ADA, all schools are required to provide accommodative services to qualified students with disabilities, including students with learning disabilities.</P>
<P>* After the first version of the short  list is created, bring disability-related concerns back into the picture. Now work to refine the short list by becoming familiar with the services that are provided to students with learning disabilities at each of the colleges or universities on the list. Most colleges and universities today have a Disability Support Services Office (which may also be called Special Student Services, or Disability Resource Center, or a similar name) or a person designated by the college president to coordinate services for students with disabilities. Some schools have comprehensive learning disabilities programs. </P>
<P>* Personally visit, preferably while classes are in session, so that you can get an impression of campus daily life, or talk by telephone with the staff of the Disability Support Services Office or the learning disabilities program. Campus staff may be able to give only general answers to questions of students who have not yet been admitted and for whom they have not reviewed any documentation. Nevertheless, a student can get a good idea about the nature of the college by asking questions such as:</P>

</UL>

<P>In addition to talking with college staff, try to arrange a meeting with several college students with learning disabilities and talk with them about the services they receive and their experiences on campus. Such a meeting can be requested at the time of scheduling the interview with the college staff.
While you will certainly be interested in the answers to the questions, the impressions that you get during the conversations will be equally important and may serve as a way to make final refinements to the short list. (HEATH's How to Choose a College: Guide for the Student with a Disability contains more detailed advice.)</P>

<H4>Caution about Course Waivers and Substitutions</H4>
<P>Colleges and universities are not required to alter admissions requirements, nor are they required to alter programmatic requirements for students with learning disabilities once they have been admitted. Students should keep such factors in mind when creating their short lists. For example, a student with a math-related learning disability would be poorly advised to accept admission at a university on the assumption that the math-requirements will be waived once that student is admitted. While colleges and universities need to give consideration to requests of students with learning disabilities for course waivers and substitutions, such waivers and substitutions are not often granted. If the campus academic committee, to whom a request for waiver is made, determines that the course in question is not an essential component of the student's course of study, it is possible that a waiver will be granted. Substitutions of other courses which convey the essential elements of the requirement (such as substituting a course in the culture of another country for a course in foreign language) are more readily granted than waivers, according to reports from the field. However, if the course in question is found to be an essential element to the student's course of study or the degree sought, it is unlikely that a waiver or a substitution would be granted. Therefore, passing such a course would continue to be a requirement for graduation. Remember, accommodative services, including the provision of course waivers and substitutions, are not to be used in a way that would lower academic standards established by the college or university. </P>

<H4>Admissions Tests and Accommodations</H4>
<P>If the colleges on the student's short list require standardized test scores, the following information is important to understand. With proper documentation, high school students with learning disabilities may take standardized college admissions tests, such as the PSAT, SAT, and ACT, with individually determined accommodations. Examples of such accommodations for students with learning disabilities may include:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> individual administration of the test, 
	<LI> audiocassette tape or large print test editions,
	<LI> special answer sheets,
	<LI> extended testing time. <BR><BR>
</UL>
<P>However, the rules and procedures for taking each of the standardized tests with accommodations varies, and students should contact the agency that administers each standardized test that he or she will need to take for specific information. Contact information for the testing agencies is provided in the Selected Resources section of this paper.</P>
<P>As is the case with each of the steps in the college search process, starting early is better than starting late. Do not wait until the last minute to contact these agencies. The tests are given across the country on specific dates only. It is the responsibility of the student to request information and accommodations in a timely fashion in order to meet the standard timelines and requirements of the agency.</P>
<P>Again, any accommodative service given by a testing agency to a student with a learning disability is solely meant to give that student equal footing in the testing environment. It is then every student's responsibility to do well, or not do well. Tests taken by students with disabilities are scored in the same fashion as those taken by students without disabilities. Scores of tests taken under a non-standard administration (that is, those taken with accommodations) are so noted when they are reported to the schools. </P>

<H4>Application and Disclosure</H4>
<P>Once students have decided on the final version of their short-list, it is time to begin the formal application process. To apply to any college, candidates must complete a form - usually one designed by the particular college - formally requesting admission. Such forms cover basic information about the prospective student. The form may not, however, require the student to disclose whether or not he or she has a disability. In addition, the student must usually supply the college with an official transcript of high school grades. Some colleges require the student to write and send a personal essay, and obtain letters of recommendation from teachers and others who can speak for the student's ability to succeed in college. Some colleges may be especially interested in evidence of a candidate's performance ability in sports, the arts, or other talents.</P>
<P>At this time the student will need to decide whether or not to "disclose" the fact that he or she has a disability. (Colleges and universities attempting to overcome past discrimination or wishing to voluntarily overcome past effects of limited participation by students with disabilities may invite applicants for admission to indicate the existence of disabilities on the application form, but may not require the applicant to respond to this pre-admission inquiry.) However, should a student decide to disclose his or her disability, this information in and of itself can not be used as a basis for denying admission. Colleges and universities can not discriminate solely on the basis of disability. On the other hand, colleges and universities are also under no obligation to alter their admissions requirements or standards. This means that having a learning disability, or any disability, does not entitle a student to admission at any college or university. Students with disabilities, like all other prospective applicants, must meet the admissions criteria established by the college or university.</P>
<P>College level admissions committees do, however, often maintain a degree of flexibility with regard to the particular qualifications that they look for in prospective students. As a result, HEATH staff often suggest that high school students with learning disabilities consider the option of disclosing their disability during the application process (either through a required essay and/or during the personal interview, if there is one). By disclosing the disability the student may explain possible discrepancies within various pieces of admissions documents. For example, a student with a learning disability may present a high school transcript with excellent grades, but may also submit SAT scores that are quite low. Or, another student may present high SAT scores, while transcript grades are varied. Such discrepancies are typical of a student with a learning disability. However, if an admissions committee is not aware that such discrepant information is being presented by a student with a learning disability, admission may be denied.</P>
<P>Disclosure of a learning disability does not guarantee admission. It can, however, offer the student the opportunity to provide the admissions committee with additional insights. For example, within a required essay, the student may explain his or her learning disability, and how the disability accounts for any discrepancies in his or her academic record. Students might convey an understanding of their learning disability, and how academic strengths and weaknesses mesh with interests in specific courses and fields of study. Students may also go on to state plans for managing their learning disability at the college level, and describe how they would work with the Office of Disability Support Services, noting their understanding of the student's responsibilities in making his or her college career successful.</P>

<H4>Making a College Choice</H4>
<P>After understanding his or her particular academic strengths and weaknesses, narrowing down the short list, visiting campuses, taking standardized college admissions tests if necessary, and completing the applications, students will be faced with making a choice among those colleges which have offered admission. Students who have worked hard at getting ready for college will be able to identify the school which seems "right." </P>

<H3>In the Meantime</H3>

<P>In addition to becoming familiar with all of the tips and procedures discussed in this paper, there are a number of additional ways that high school students with learning disabilities can prepare for college. In order to make themselves more attractive candidates, students should consider the following:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> Take courses in high school that will help prepare for college. If appropriate, take foreign language credits and computer training while still in high school. <BR><BR>
	<LI> Consider internships, or part-time jobs, or volunteer community service that will develop necessary skills.<BR><BR>
	<LI> Consider enrolling in a summer pre-college program specifically designed for students with learning disabilities in either the summer before or after the high school senior year. Such short-term experiences (most programs are designed to last anywhere from one week to one month) have been shown to be incredibly helpful in giving students a feel for what college or university life will be like. (Each spring, HEATH produces Summer Pre-College Programs for Students with Learning Disabilities which is a listing of select programs across the country).<BR><BR>
	<LI> Contact the local Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agency and investigate eligibility requirements. VR agencies may offer a variety of services to eligible students with learning disabilities, including vocational assessment, tuition assistance, or testing services.<BR><BR>
	<LI> Explore sources of financing the college education. Most families need financial assistance to pay the costs of attending college. While there is very little scholarship money specifically for students with learning disabilities, readers are encouraged to review the HEATH paper, Financial Aid for Students with Disabilities.<BR><BR>
	<LI> Become familiar with, and practice using, the various compensatory strategies identified earlier in this paper. For example, students may want to practice talking to their high school teachers and administrators about their academic strengths and weaknesses and the ways in which they compensate for their learning disabilities. <BR><BR>
	<LI> Join one of the national organizations which provide support not only to students with learning disabilities, but also to parents and professionals, as well. Participation in the activities of such organizations is an excellent way to build confidence, to increase disability awareness and disability-related knowledge, and to get information about special programs and resources.<BR><BR>

<H3>A Message To Students </H3>

<P>Awareness of your strengths, your advocacy skills, and persistence are among the most important tools you can use to build your future through education. You can maximize the range of colleges that may admit you by playing an active role in high school, getting appropriate support, continually assessing your growth, and carefully planning. Students may be admitted only to colleges and universities to which they actually apply. More students who have learning disabilities than ever before are applying to, enrolling in, and graduating from America's colleges and universities. You can join the growing number of undergraduates who have learning disabilities. Good luck in getting ready for college.</P>

<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How selections are made</H3>

The editor and an advisory committee of children's book
specialists meet on an average of once a month during the year to
examine newly published titles-well over five thousand hardcover
and paperbound books in 1993-to choose about a hundred titles
they consider to be the most noteworthy.
<br><Br>
Selection criteria have remained constant over the years. 
Quality of plot, theme, style, pace, characterization, and
setting is essential for any story to be satisfying.  In
addition, for the picture-story book, the art-its harmony with
the text-is vital.  For nonfiction books, accuracy, organization,
timeliness, and clarity of presentation as well as quality of
writing and illustration need to be evaluated.<BR><BR>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What is selected and for whom</H3>

The selected books run the gamut from rhymes, concepts, and
picture-stories to adventure, fantasy, natural history,
biography, and science.  Books are chosen for readers from the
toddler stage to the teenage years.  Some are to be read aloud;
some are for instruction; some are for fun; some are to be
borrowed from a school or public library or bought as gifts.  All
were chosen with the intent of stimulating the imaginations of
children and adults alike.<BR><BR>

<P>	Take a moment to determine whether or not your child is able to accomplish the following items.</P>

<ol>

<li>Recite his or her full name, address and telephone number including area code, city and state?

<br><br><li>Use a phone to make long distance call, dial direct or get operator assistance?

<br><br><li>Does your child know to never enter anyone's home without your permission?

<br><br><li>Knows of any certain home where they are not to enter under any circumstances?

<br><br><li>If separated from you in a store, would your child go to the nearest check-out clerk?

<br><br><li>Could he or she verify that the person is in fact an employee of the store?

<br><br><li>Would he or she go into the parking lot either alone or if encouraged by an adult?

<br><br><li>Knows always to play with others - to go places on the "buddy-system?"

<br><br><li>Knows that adults seldom ask for directions from children and that if approached by a car, they should never go near or get in an automobile with a stranger?

<br><br><li>Does your child know not to accept rides from a stranger or even acquaintances without your specific permission?

<br><br><li>If home alone, knows not to answer the door or tell anyone over the phone that they are alone?

<br><br><li>If followed by an adult or stranger, would your child know to proceed immediately to a place where there are other people; e.g., a store or a neighbor's house?

<br><br><li>Would your child yell "No" and create a scene in public if they were being subjected to bad touches?

<br><br><li>Do you and your child have a code word to exchange if your plans changes?

<br><br><li>Does your child know never to talk or accept gifts of any kind from strangers?

</ol>

<P>	Every "NO" answer indicates an area of risk for your child. It is probably a good idea to ask your child these questions in a modified form as an added precaution.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC) today announced that Chairman Ann Brown
has awarded the CPSC Chairman's Commendation for
Significant Contributions to Product Safety to the American
Furniture Manufacturers Association (AFMA) for its efforts
to make bunk beds safe for the children and families of
America.</P>

<P>     "Whenever we can, we want to prevent problems before
they happen," Brown said. "In 1995, CPSC staff requested
several changes in the voluntary standard for bunk beds. We
explained the seriousness of the lower bunk entrapment
problem associated with bunk beds, and asked the leadership
of AFMA to communicate this to the members of the industry.
Thanks to their hard work, manufacturers have given their
support to a stronger voluntary standard."</P>

<P>     Brown cited AFMA's leadership in strengthening the
industry voluntary standard on spacing for bunk beds to help
keep children safe. The current voluntary standard addresses
entrapment hazards associated with the top bunk. The
manufacturers have agreed to strengthen the voluntary
standard to address entrapment hazards associated with lower
bunks.</P>

<P>     "We are a regulatory agency," Brown said. "But we
prefer to work voluntarily with industry. It is a pleasure
to recognize AFMA for helping make bunk beds safe."</P>

<P>     In addition to AFMA, the CPSC Chairman's Commendation
has been awarded to: Toys "R" Us; Procter &amp; Gamble; Sunbeam
Plastics; Playskool, a division of Hasbro Inc.;
Rollerblade Inc.; the International Inline Skating
Association; and the Whirlpool Corporation.</P>

<P>     Chairman Brown initiated the commendation program to
recognize substantial contributions to product safety by
individuals, companies, or groups for one-time, ongoing, or
multiple actions. Nominees for the award, which is given
periodically, may be brought to the Chairman's attention.
Chairman Brown will consider the following factors in
choosing award recipients:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Actions that contribute to reducing hazards to children
	 and other vulnerable populations;
	<LI>Voluntary actions that are not mandated by government
	 regulations, that anticipate
	 government regulation, or that go beyond what the government
	 requires;
	<LI>Developments that affect the safety of large numbers of
 individuals;
	<LI>Innovations or improvements to existing products;
	 and safety devices, packaging, warnings, or products
	 which enhance consumer safety.
</UL>

<P>   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the
public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's
fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)
638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the
release number. Consumers can obtain this release
and recall information via Internet gopher services at
cpsc.gov or report product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<P>By Tuesday, Anna became increasingly irritable.  Her normally rose-red
lips lost color, and the rest of her color became quite ashen, as if dead.
She became puffy, especially in her hands and feet where her arches
disappeared, and they had to cut off the bracelets they had strapped on
her within the last two days because they became too tight.  She was on
IVs until it was determined that she was "taking on" fluids, at which
point she was placed on a fluid restricted diet.  She would beg us for
water, but we could give her only a sip every hour.  Her lips became dried
and bloody.</P>

<P>Tuesday afternoon, a friend stopped by and mentioned that she had heard
they were recalling Odwalla apple juice in the State of Washington for
having caused an E. coli outbreak there.  Somewhere between 10 and 13
people had been affected.  Scott called Odwalla, finally speaking with a
founder about Anna's situation. As I began to think about it, even though
Stanford seemed to have thought the other lab had tested for E. coli, I
didn't remember anyone actually ordering such a test.  As far as I
remembered, we had only tested for salmonella, campylobacter and shigella.
Now, Anna  hadn't had a stool in over four days.  When questioned, the
Stanford nursing staff reported back that there was actually neither a
positive nor a negative on the stool culture for E. coli.  I called Anna's
pediatrician and left a message.</P>

<P>Scott also initiated a call with the Santa Clara County Department of
Health.  They were very interested and said that HUS had just recently
become a reportable disease in California, though they had no other
examples found in Santa Clara County.  Ironically, Stanford is just the
other side of the border for San Mateo County.  My mother had purchased
the apple juice in San Mateo County, and shortly thereafter, cases were
reported in San Mateo County.</P>

<P>They began a second transfusion on Tuesday afternoon.  To reduce the
likelihood of an allergic reaction, they gave her Benadryl and Tylenol and
"washed down" the blood to be transfused.  Anna's eyes became glassy, and
she stared into space when she wasn't sleeping.  As it went on, her color
returned, but her numbers did not improve the way they expected.  In fact,
her platelet counts plummeted.  Her BUN, a second measurement of wastes,
rose above 100--in some patients a sign of impending dialysis.   They were
constantly measuring the amount she pee'd, trying to determine whether her
kidneys were keeping up with the fluid.</P>

<P>We were exhausted, living on at most four hours of sleep per night.  Any
time day or night that a transfusion or IV line didn't flow correctly, an
alarm that sounded like a doorbell would go off, repeating itself until we
could get a nurse to change it.  Likewise, if Anna bent her right index
finger, her heartrate monitor would sound off.  They moved us to another,
smaller room on the ward, and I asked our friends not to visit because the
grandparents, Scott and I were now snapping at each other.</P>

<P>Word came back from Anna's primary pediatrician--they had never tested for
E. coli.  He was upset.  "It's standard practice to look for E. coli as
part of these tests, but the lab decided her stool wasn't 'bloody enough.'
'Not bloody enough," --sounds real scientific, doesn't it?  We've got to
change the standard practice."  Had E. coli been found early on, it was
possible it could have been treated with antibiotics.  Wednesday evening,
the local news stations covered another child who had fallen ill and was
at Oakland Children's Hospital.  She was already on dialysis.  Scott and I
agreed that our objective had to be to help other parents quickly identify
this illness; we gave the media department a statement about Anna's
condition.</P>

<P>Thursday, though Anna was looking better and some of her blood signs were
improving, her platelet and red blood cell counts were still low.  Because
her kidney output was fine, she was taken off of the restricted fluids
diet.  Her normal blood pressure made everyone optimistic, but they wanted
to give her a third transfusion.  We mistakenly believed they could give
us blood from the same source as the original transfusion, and we caused a
stir when we insisted on speaking to the doctor about getting blood from
the same source.  It wasn't possible, and we were confused.  And tired.</P>

<P>Because Anna had still not had a stool, the doctors offered to do a rectal
swab to see if they could find the E. coli.  For them, the E. coli search
must have seemed like a boondoggle.  They were not seeing more cases at
Stanford which would suggest an epidemic, and knowing that it was E. coli
would not at that point have changed the treatment.  But we wanted to know
the source.  Just when we thought we might have to do the swab, Anna
passed her first stool in six days.  It was rushed to the lab to be
cultured.</P>

<P>On Friday, we received the great news for which we had prayed.  Anna's
creatinine had gone down, and her platelets had shot back up.  Her red
blood cell counts were creeping back up as well.  They were thinking she
might go home the next day!  An official from the Santa Clara County came
to ask us the questions we had already asked ourselves.  Had she been
swimming in any bodies of water?  Had she been to any fast food
restaurants?  Had she eaten any ground meat or unpasteurized cheeses?
They took our empty and half-full Odwalla juice bottles.  One from
Grandma's house had the stamp: October 24, 2FN on it.  The other jug or
jugs were already gone to recycling.  We also were visited by one of the
founders of the Odwalla company, who had left an emotional message on our
answering machine the day before.  Remarkably, she arrived just as things
were finally looking up; she was as upset and apologetic as one can be
without admitting fault.  We believed that the "friend" who came with her
was probably a lawyer.</P>

<P>Anna returned home from the Stanford Children's Hospital on Saturday,
November 2, around 1:00 p.m.  on Saturday.  Her condition was not yet
normal-- she was anemic with a low platelet count--but the doctors have
never seen a case of HUS relapse after the appropriate indicators turn the
corner, so they felt confident in discharging her.</P>

<P>The doctors encouraged us to keep her home the first week in order to avoid
any "accidents" which might result in bruising or cuts that required more
platelets.  Because this disease is relatively new, her long term prognosis
is unknown.  Her first blood check showed that her platelets had risen into
a normal range.  Three weeks after discharge she was still excreting blood
cells in her urine and was still anemic.  They will check her again in
mid-December and continue to check up on her every year until adulthood.
Possible long term complications include kidney failure over time,
permanent neurologic injury, or high blood pressure.  E. coli O157:H7 was
only recognized as the source of illness in 1982 and as a cause of HUS in
1985.  Therefore, there is relatively little long term data.</P>

<P>Anna's stool culture results finally came back positive for O157:H7 more
than a month after they were first taken to the lab.  The State of
Washington has found E. coli contamination in Odwalla apple juice with a
lot number 2FO and the same expiration date as the bottle in Grandma's
refrigerator.  However, they could not find E. coli in Grandma's last jug
of apple juice.  When questioned about why the State of California's
response was relatively slow compared to the State of Washington, Dr. Jim
Stratton, State Health Officer, indicated that there are three key features
of Washington:
<ol>
	<li> Washington has had multiple outbreaks and is therefore prepared
to move quickly</p>
	<li>There is a single pediatric hospital in the Seattle/King County
area; therefore, all cases are brought into a single point of
communication, so an epidemic becomes obvious.</p>
	<li> All diarrheal stools, bloody or not, are tested for E. coli.
California chooses to test only bloody stools, thus choosing to miss cases.
This lack of data, coupled with a lack of centralized reporting to a single
source means that the U.S. does not have a firm grip on the increasing
spread of this organism, nor can they tell you the likelihood of your
child's coming into contact with it.
</ol></P>

<H3> What Needs To Change </H3>

<P>The present notification and investigation systems available in most of
the United States and the State of California are inadequate for detecting
and preventing the spread of food poisonings, which can be deadly to
children and adversely affect pregnant women.  The nature of the United
States in the 1990's is that fresh produce and goods and ground-meat
products, which can be contaminated with E. coli, can be distributed over
many states and cause widely distributed epidemics that are no longer
simple, isolated incidents such as local, road-side apple cider.   The
Center for Disease Control has a responsibility to make HUS a reportable
disease in order to assist in the rapid gathering of information and
preventing further spread of disease.</P>

<P>Throughout California, each county must begin immediately notifying
neighboring counties of cases of suspected E. coli poisoning and HUS
rather than waiting for the State Department of Health to begin its
bureaucratic process. The nature of food poisoning is that by the time the
symptoms are cultured and obvious, the initial food and thus evidence has
been thrown out; yet, food still harboring infectious agents sits waiting
on shelves for unsuspecting consumers.   In the time that it takes
bureaucracies to move forward, more children can be afflicted.  I believe
that the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health in the state of
Washington has done more in this investigative area than other counties
because they have been hit three times now with outbreaks of E. coli: once
with the Jack-in-the-Box case in 1993 , once with a salami case in 1994,
and now with Odwalla.  Other county health departments should follow King
County's example in the speed with which it acted to determine the cause
of the infection and prevent its spread.</P>

<P>Blood labs MUST routinely scan for E. coli poisoning whenever any food
poisoning such as salmonella, shigella or campylobacter is suspected,
regardless of whether the stool appears bloody.  If the course of
treatment for the initial patient is not changed, at the very least, other
cases may be prevented.  Tests must be developed that rapidly determine
infection from E. coli O157:H7 and salmonella.  The present stool culture
mechanism is ridiculously long and hopelessly inadequate for quickly
determining and acting upon a deadly disease.</P>

<P>Lastly, parents must be constantly vigilant for this type of disease.  The
symptoms of E. coli poisoning are different from flu, but they are not
identical in all cases.  In our daughter's case, the diarrhea did not
appear particularly bloody.  There was no fever, and there was no
vomiting.  However, there were constant, painful stomach cramps that
awakened her every two hours throughout the night.  Though she was toilet
trained, she could rarely get to the bathroom in time.</P>

<P>As for Odwalla, I believe that the management team has an opportunity to
lead the natural-food industry in researching new tests that quickly and
accurately determine the contamination levels of fresh juices.  Should the
natural-food industry find itself unable to regulate contamination out of
its products, I believe that all apple juice should carry a blatant
warning: "WARNING: unpasteurized apple juice has been identified as a
potential source of E. coli O157:H7 infections which can make you sick and
are deadly to small children."  Likewise, the stores that carry organic
produce should be required to post signs that say: "WARNING: this store
sells produce of undetermined contamination levels.  Food sold here may be
contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, which is known to be deadly to small
children."  We don't feed alcoholic beverages to small children; why would
we give them juices that might kill them?</P>

     Today's nonprescription, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are
safe and effective treatments. And they are serious
medicines--no less so for children than adults. With that in
mind, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), working with
manufacturers of OTC drugs, developed this important advice for
parents:

<ol>
  <li>Never guess on the amount of medicine given. Kids aren't
     just small adults: Half an adult dose may be more than
     your child needs--or not enough to help.

  <li>Always check for the proper dose. Read the label--every
     time.

  <li>Know the abbreviations for tablespoon (Tbsp) and teaspoon
     (Tsp). Don't confuse them.

  <li>Avoid making conversions. If the label says two teaspoons
     and you're using a dosing cup with ounces only, get
     another measuring device.

  <li>Never play doctor. Twice the dose is not appropriate just
     because your child seems twice as sick as last time.

 <li>Always talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving two
     medicines at the same time.

  <li>Always follow the age-limit recommendations. If the label
     says don't give to children under two, don't do it. Call
     your doctor.

  <li>Always use the child-resistant cap, and re-lock the cap
     after each use.

  <li>Heed the "keep out of reach" warning. We've come a long
     way since cod liver oil and nose holding to get the
     medicine down. Today's medicines are often flavored--all
     the more reason to store all drugs out of reach.

 <li>As with any medicine, always check the package and the
     medicine itself for signs of tampering. Don't use any
     medicine from a package that shows cuts, tears, slices or
     other imperfections. If you notice anything suspicious,
     tell the pharmacist or store manager.<BR><BR>

     Parents of a new baby have a million things to do, but
menu-planning isn't one of them. Until a baby is <B>4 to 6 months
old</B>, for breakfast, lunch and dinner--and, of course, the
infamous middle-of-the-night feeding--the <B>only</B> items on the
menu are either <B>breast milk or infant formula</B>.<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<H3><a name="Breast Milk IB">Breast Milk Is Best</a></H3>


     Usually a manufacturer won't announce that the
competition's product is a better choice. But when the
competition is breast milk, <B>infant formula manufacturers
concede</B>--right on the label-that <B>breast milk is best</B>.<br><br>

     Human breast milk is the ideal nourishment for human
babies. Its protein content is particularly suited to a baby's
metabolism, and the fat content is more easily absorbed and
digested than the fats in cow's milk.<br><br>

     Breast milk also may protect the infant against certain
diseases, infections and allergies. A mother's milk contains
cells from her immune system and antibodies against diseases to
which she has been exposed. Antibodies she develops after the
baby is born are also passed to the baby through the breast
milk.<br><br>

     For example, if Mom catches the flu, she develops
antibodies to that strain of flu virus. Richard Schanler, M.D.,
associate professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of
Medicine, Houston, explains, "The baby will get some
protection. [The baby] might not get the flu at all, or the
case may be milder... than if he or she wasn't breast-fed to
begin with."<br><br>

[Graphic Omitted]<br><br>

    However, risks of breast milk may outweigh advantages if a
nursing mother takes certain medications or abuses drugs. The
quality and quantity of the mother's diet may affect the
quality and quantity of breast milk. (See "Good Nutrition for
Breast-Feeding Mothers" in the December 1986-January 1987 FDA
Consumer.)<br><br>

     "Learn about breast-feeding before the baby is born," says
Julie Stock of the La Leche League, an international
breast-feeding support and educational organization. "If you
know a lot beforehand, you start to build a sense of
confidence. Many attempts at breast-feeding fail because of
wrong information."<br><br>

     Once the baby is born, breast-feeding as soon as possible
after delivery and often is the first of three essential keys
for success, says Stock.<br><br>

     The second key is no artificial nipples--that includes
pacifiers as well as bottles of water or formula--during the
first few weeks. Stock explains that some babies can become
very confused by the different feel and the different way of
sucking needed with a bottle or pacifier, and they may not be
able to switch back to the breast.<br><br>

     Finally, it is important to make sure that the baby
"latches on" to the mother's nipple correctly. "If [a mother]
has those three things going for her, in general that will
eliminate about 90 percent of the common problems that mothers
have," says Stock.<br><br>

     The La Leche League has local chapter meetings throughout
the country where expectant and new mothers can learn about
breast-feeding, nutrition, and other aspects of child care. For
the number of your local chapter, call the La Leche League at
1-708-455-7730 or write to La Leche League International, 9616

     The composition of infant formula is similar to breast
milk, but it isn't a perfect match. Further, the exact chemical
makeup of breast milk is still unknown.<br><br>

     "We're always discovering things in human milk that are
there in small quantities that hadn't been looked at before,"
says John C. Wallingford, Ph.D., an infant nutrition specialist
with FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. "But
[infant formula] is increasingly close to breast milk,
especially in the area of fatty acids and lipids."<br><br>

     More than half the calories in breast milk come from fat,
and the same is true for today's infant formulas. This may be
alarming to many American adults watching their intake off at
and cholesterol, especially when high saturated fats, such as
coconut oil are used in formulas. (High saturated fats tend to
increase blood cholesterol levels more than other fats or
oils.) But the low-fat diet recommended for adults doesn't
apply to infants.<br><br>

     "Infants have a very high energy requirement, and they
have a restricted volume of food that they can digest," says
Wallingford. "The only way to get the energy density of a food
up is to increase the amount of fat."<br><br>

     Homemade formulas should not be used, says Nick Duy,
assistant to the director in FDA's division of regulatory
guidance. Homemade formulas based on whole cows' milk don't
meet all of an infant's vitamin and mineral needs. In addition,
the high protein content of cow's milk makes it difficult for
an infant to digest and may put a strain on the baby's immature
kidneys. Substituting evaporated milk for whole milk may make
the formula easier to digest, but it is still nutritionally
inadequate when compared to commercially prepared formula. Use
of soy drinks as an infant formula can actually be
life-threatening (see accompanying article<a href="#Soy Beverages"> Soy Beverages</a>).<br><br>

     Commercially prepared formulas are regulated by the Food
and Drug Administration as a food for special dietary use.
"Infant formulas are the most heavily regulated food that there
is," says Wallingford.<br><br>

     FDA regulations specify exact nutrient level requirements
for infant formulas, based on recommendations by the American
Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition. The following
must be included in all formulas:<br><br>

 <UL>
<LI>  * protein
<LI>   * fat
<LI>   * linoleic acid
<LI>   * vitamin A
<LI>   * vitamin D
<LI>   * vitamin E
<LI>   * vitamin K
<LI>   * thiamine (vitamin B1)
<LI>   * riboflavin (vitamin B2)
<LI>   * vitamin B6
<LI>   * vitamin B12
<LI>   * niacin
<LI>   * folic acid
<LI>   * pantothenic acid
<LI>   * vitamin C
<LI>   * calcium
<LI>   * phosphorus
<LI>   * magnesium
<LI>   * iron
<LI>   * zinc
<LI>   * manganese
<LI>   * copper
<LI>   * iodine
<LI>   * sodium
<LI>   * potassium
<LI>   * chloride
</UL>

     In addition, formulas not made with cow's milk must
include biotin, choline and inositol.<br><br>

     The safety of commercially prepared formula is also
enhanced by strict quality control procedures that require
manufacturers to analyze each batch of formula for required
nutrients, to test representative samples for stability over
the shelf life of the product, to code containers to identify
the batch, and to make all records available to FDA
investigators.<br><br>

     The most common sources of protein in infant formulas are
either cow's milk or soybeans. "For term infants, soy formulas
appear to be as nutritionally sound as milk-based formulas, and
their use is unlikely to expose infants to nutritional risk,"
wrote pediatrician Samuel J. Foman in 1987 in the American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Baylor's Schanler agrees, but
says that there is some question about whether the minerals in
soy-based formulas can be used by the infant's body as well as
those from cow's milk formula.<br><br>

     For a healthy, full-term infant, "cow's milk formula would
be the first choice," Schanler says. "The only indication that
I see for soy formula is for babies with lactose intolerance."<br><br>

     Lactose, also known as milk sugar, is the main
carbohydrate in milk. Infants who don't have enough of the
enzyme lactase to digest the lactose may suffer from abdominal
pain, diarrhea, gas, bloating, or cramps. There is no lactose
in soy formula.<br><br>

     Schanler does not think soy formula is a good choice for
infants with milk allergies, however. "If there is a real
history of [milk] allergy in the family, the baby might be
allergic to soy, too," he says. Instead of soy, Schanler
recommends special cow's milk formulas known as protein
hydrolysates, which won't cause allergic reactions because the
proteins are already broken down. "That way the chance of a
cross reaction with the soy protein is eliminated," he
explains.<br><br>

     Both milk and soy formulas are available in powder, liquid
concentrate, or ready-to-feed forms. The choice should depend
on "whatever the parents find convenient and can afford," says
Schanler.<br><br>

     Whatever form is chosen, proper preparation and
refrigeration are essential. Opened cans of ready-to-feed and
liquid concentrate must be refrigerated and used within the
time specified on the can. Once the powder is mixed with water
it should also be refrigerated, if it is not used right away.
The exact amounts of water recommended on the label must be
used. Under-diluted formula can cause problems for the infant's
organs and digestive system. Over-diluted formula will not
provide adequate nutrition, and the baby may fail to thrive and
grow.<br><br>

     Warming the formula isn't necessary for proper nutrition,
says William MacLean, M.D., a pediatrician at infant formula
manufacturer Ross Laboratories. "There is nothing magical about
having [the formula] warmed up to body temperature," he says.
"But if it's cold, some babies may refuse it. It's the baby's
preference."<br><br>

     <B>Bottles should not be heated in microwave ovens</B> because
the ovens don't heat evenly, MacLean warns. "The drop a mother
tests on her wrist could be fine," he says. But, he explains,
undetected "hot spots" in the formula could seriously burn the
baby.<br><br>

     The best way to warm a bottle of formula is by placing the
bottle in a pot of water and heating the pot on the stove,
according to Christine Watson, a nurse who specializes in
maternal and newborn care at the Shady Grove Adventist Hospital
in Gaithersburg, Md. "You can also run hot tap water over the
bottle, but that isn't very quick," she says.<br><br>

<H3><a name="Soy Beverages">Soy Beverages Not Complete Formulas</a>
</H3>

     A severely malnourished 5-month-old infant was admitted to
Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, Ark., in February
1990 with symptoms including heart failure, rickets, vasculitis
(blood vessel inflammation), and possible neurological damage.
According to the hospital, the baby girl had been fed nothing
but Soy Moo since she was 3 days old. Soy Moo is a soy beverage
sold in health food stores.<br><br>

     This kind of soy beverage, sometimes improperly called
"soy milk," should not be confused with soy-based infant
formulas. Unlike true infant formulas, which are nutritionally
complete and appropriate for infants, soy beverages are lacking
some of the nutrients infants need. Analysis of Soy Moo by the
Arkansas Children's Hospital revealed deficiencies in calcium,
niacin, and vitamins D, E and C.<br><br>

     Labels on Soy Moo cartons and literature about the drink
do not suggest that Soy Moo be used as an infant formula. In
addition, an FDA investigation found no evidence that the
infant's parents were explicitly told that Soy Moo could be
used as a baby's sole nourishment. Nevertheless, Soy Moo's
distributor, Health Valley Foods, Irwindale, Calif., has
voluntarily stopped distribution until new labels stating "Do
Not Use As Infant Formula" can be printed. FDA learned of a
similar incident that occurred in April 1990 when a California
couple questioned a physician about their 2-month-old
daughter's failure to gain weight. The physician discovered
that the baby had been exclusively fed Edensoy, another brand
of soy beverage. A midwife had recommended Edensoy to the
parents, according to the FDA investigator assigned to the
case.<br><br>

     In response to this incident, Edensoy's manufacturer, Eden
Foods, Clinton, Mich., wrote all its retailers in the United
States and Canada to remind them that Edensoy is not an infant
formula. In addition, the letter said, "Please make sure that
no store personnel suggest or imply that Edensoy or other soy
beverages are suitable for use as infant formula."<br><br>

     In an effort to prevent this problem with similar soy
beverages, FDA asked all 68 known manufacturers, importers,
and private label distributors of these products to include a
warning against using the beverages as infant formula. The
agency does not, however, have the regulatory authority to
require this warning.<br><br>

     Soy drinks like the ones shown above should never be used
as infant formula because they are not nutritionally complete
as a sole source of food for infants. True infant formulas made
with soy proteins, such as those shown below, may be used for
babies who can't digest lactose, the main carbohydrate in cow's
milk formulas.<br><br>

<H3><a name="Vitamin Sups">Vitamin Supplements--Yes or No?</a>
</H3>

     The American Academy of Pediatrics says "the normal
breast-fed infant of the well-nourished mother has not been
shown conclusively to need any specific vitamin and mineral
supplement. Similarly, there is no evidence that
supplementation is necessary for the full-term, formula-fed
infant and for the properly nourished normal child."<br><br>

     Many physicians recommend supplements,
nevertheless--especially for breast-fed infants. "There is
definitely some controversy here," says Wallingford.<br><br>

     The controversy on supplements usually revolves around the
following:

<ul>

 <li>  * <B>Iron</B>--Although the amount of iron in breast milk is very
     low (0.3 milligrams of iron per liter), the infant absorbs
     almost half. In contrast, while iron-fortified formulas
     contain 10 to 12 mg per liter, babies absorb only about 4
     percent, amounting to about 0.4 mg per liter to 0.5 mg per
     liter. In either case, those amounts of iron are adequate
     for the first 4 to 6 months, according to the American
     Academy of Pediatrics.<br><br>

     In the past, there was concern that iron-fortified
     formulas could cause gastrointestinal problems such as
     colic, constipation, diarrhea, or vomiting. But, based on
     several studies over the last 10 years, the American
     Academy of Pediatrics does not believe there is any
     evidence connecting these problems to iron and recommends
     that iron-fortified formula be used for all formula-fed
     infants.<br><br>

<li>   * <B>Vitamin D</B>--Insufficient vitamin D can cause rickets, a
     disease that results in softening and bending of the
     bones. Although the amounts of vitamin D in breast milk
     are small, rickets is uncommon in the breast-fed term
     infant. This may be because, like the iron in breast milk,
     the vitamin D in breast milk is easily absorbed by the
     baby.<br><br>

     Sunlight is important for the formation of vitamin D, but
     probably as little as a few minutes exposure a day is all
     the baby needs, says Schanler, and exposure to the whole
     body isn't necessary--just the arms and face are enough.<br><br>

 <li>  * <B>Fluoride</B>--No one knows for sure if giving fluoride during
     the first six months of life will result in fewer
     cavities. Reflecting the uncertainty surrounding fluoride
     supplements, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends
     starting fluoride supplements shortly after birth in
     breast-fed infants, but also says that waiting up to six 
     months is acceptable. Because there is no fluoride in
     infant formula, that twofold recommendation also applies
     when ready-to-feed formula is used or when the water used
     for powdered or concentrated formula has less than 0.3
     parts per million of fluoride.<br><br>
</ul>

<H3><a name="Solid Evidence">Solid Evidence</a></H3>


     Sometime between a baby's 4-month and 6-month birthdays
solid food can be introduced. Exactly when depends on several
factors.<br><br>

     One factor involves the disappearance of the involuntary
action called the extrusion reflex. Before this reflex
disappears, feeding solids usually involves putting a spoonful
in the mouth and scraping most of it off the baby's face as he
or she spits it back out.<br><br>

     Also, babies should be able to sit up and turn their heads
away. That way, Schanler explains, they can communicate that
they're not ready for the next spoonful or just not hungry
anymore.<br><br>

     Usually, the first food recommended is a single-grain,
iron-fortified infant cereal. Starting with single-grain
cereals makes it easier to pinpoint any allergic
reactions. (For more information on introducing solids, see
"Good Nutrition for the Highchair Set" in the September
1985 FDA Consumer.)<br><br>

     The biggest concern with feeding solids too early is that
the solids will replace breast milk or formula in the baby's
diet. "Solids vary nutritionally depending on the food," says
Schanler. "None of them is as complete as formula or breast
milk. You don't want to rob [the baby] of milk."<br><br>

     Feeding babies exclusively with breast milk or formula
during the first few months is not only the best thing for the
babies' health, it can also be a blessing for busy, overtired
parents. Now if only the baby would sleep through the night.<br><br>

     The next time disaster strikes, you may not have much time
 to act. Prepare now for a sudden emergency.
<br><br> 
     Learn how to protect yourself and cope with disaster by
 planning ahead. This checklist will help you get started.
 Discuss these ideas with your family, then prepare an emergency
 plan. Post the plan where everyone will see it--on the
 refrigerator or bulletin board.
<br><br> 
     For additional information about how to prepare for
 hazards in your community, contact your local emergency
 management or civil defense office and American Red Cross
 chapter.

<a name="Escape"></a>
<h3>Escape Plan</h3>
 
 
     In a fire or other emergency, you may need to evacuate
 your house, apartment or mobile home on a moment's notice. You
 should be ready to get out fast.
<br><br> 
     Develop an escape plan by drawing a floor plan of your
 residence. Using a black or blue pen, show the location of
 doors, windows, stairways, and large furniture. Indicate the
 location of emergency supplies (Disaster Supplies Kit), fire
 extinguishers, smoke detectors, collapsible ladders, first aid
 kits and utility shut off points. Next, use a colored pen to
 draw a broken line charting at least two escape routes from
 each room. Finally, mark a place outside of the home where
 household members should meet in case of fire.
<br><br> 
Be sure to include important points outside such as
 garages, patios, stairways, elevators, driveways and porches.
 If your home has more than two floors, use an additional sheet
 of paper. Practice emergency evacuation drills with all
 household members at least two times each year.<BR><BR>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In an effort to prevent tragedies like
that of the young Ohio girl who was killed when the
drawstring of her coat got trapped in a school bus door,
Senator Mike Dewine (R-Ohio) and Rep. David Hobson (R-Ohio)
joined U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Ann
Brown at a Capitol Hill press conference today to announce
new guidelines for drawstrings on children's outerwear.</P>

    <P> From January 1985 through September 1995, CPSC received
reports of 17 deaths and 42 non-fatal incidents involving
children whose hood and waist drawstrings became entangled
on playground equipment, bus doors and other common items.
At least 12 children were involved in incidents involving
school bus doors, including a 13-year-old girl from Ohio who
died after the string on her jacket got caught in a school
bus door and she was dragged under the bus. Other children
have died when the drawstrings on their jacket hoods became
caught on items such as playground equipment and cribs.</P>

<P>     "This effort cuts through red tape and avoids
regulation and costly legal battles, yet it gives parents
and industry the information they need to save children's
lives," Chairman Brown said.</P>

<P>     The guidelines are part of CPSC's ongoing voluntary
effort to alert consumers and manufacturers to the risk of
strangulation associated with drawstrings on children's
outerwear.</P>

<P>In April 1994, CPSC staff met with industry representatives
to develop a voluntary agreement that eliminates drawstrings
from the neck and hoods of children's outerwear.</P>

<P>     These guidelines will serve two purposes. First, they
will tell manufacturers how to design safety into their
garments, and design drawstrings out. Second, the guidelines
will tell parents to take the drawstrings off the hoods and
necks of children's jackets and sweatshirts, and to
substantially shorten the drawstrings around the bottom of
coats and jackets.</P>


<P>     "I have studied the drawstring problem for several
months and am encouraged by CPSC's new guidelines," Senator
DeWine said. "The length of these drawstrings has 
contributed to several of the tragedies that have occurred
on school buses in Ohio and across the country. These new
guidelines are an important step towards saving kids'
lives."</P>
<P>     "In the past the garment industry has been supportive
of measures to make children's clothing safer, and I fully
expect them to support these new guidelines as well," said
Hobson.
"The deaths that have occurred, like Brandi Browder's, are a
horrible tragedy. By raising awareness of this problem,
government can work with the garment industry to make
constructive changes and prevent a repeat of these tragedies
in the future."</P>
<P>     Manufacturers and consumers can obtain "Guidelines for
Drawstrings on Children's Clothing" by sending a postcard
with their name and address to "Drawstring Guidelines,"
CPSC, Washington, D.C. 20207. </P>
<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death
from 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction.  To report a dangerous product or a product-related
injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call
CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at
(800) 638-8270.  To order a press release through fax-on-demand,
call (301) 504-0051 from the handset of a fax machine and enter
the release number; for a copy of the "Guidelines," fax-on-demand
users should order document #1006.  Consumers can also obtain
this release and recall information via Internet gopher services
at cpsc.gov or report product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), The Lane Company of
Altavista, Va., is announcing a voluntary program to replace
the locks on cedar chests manufactured prior to 1987. The
Lane Company manufactured approximately 12 million cedar
chests from 1912 to 1987 that latch automatically when the
lid is closed. Young children playing in the chest can
become trapped inside and suffocate.</P>
<P>     Between 1977 and 1994, six children suffocated inside
Lane cedar chests manufactured with an old design lock. The
victims ranged in age from 21 months to ten years
old.</P>
<P>     Consumers can determine whether their chest has an old
lock by closing the chest lid without depressing the locking
button and then attempting to open the lid without touching
the button. If the lid opens, the chest has the new lock and
does not need to be replaced. If the lid does not open, it
has the old lock. Additionally, old locks click loudly when
the lid is shut, locking the chest automatically.</P>
<P>     Furniture stores sold the chests nationwide in a
variety of styles, sizes, and colors between 1912 and 1987.
Some of the chests may have been handed down through
families.  By 1987, The Lane Company began manufacturing all
of its cedar chests with redesigned locks, which do not need
to be replaced.</P>
<P>     Consumers who own Lane cedar chests with old locks
should call The Lane Company toll-free at (888) 856-8758 for
free, redesigned, easy to install safety locks. Lane will
make special arrangements for consumers who need additional
help installing the locks.</P>
   

<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on
CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800)
638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To
order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the
release number.  Consumers can obtain this release
and recall information via Internet gopher services at
<A HREF="gopher://cpsc.gov">cpsc.gov</A> or report product hazards to <a href="mailto:info@cpsc.gov">info@cpsc.gov</a>. </p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), Now Products of Cicero, Ill., is
announcing a recall to home repair approximately 20,000 foam chairs for
children. Children can unzip the chair's fabric cover,
exposing a thin, clear plastic liner, which could cause choking. </p>

<p>Now Products is aware of two incidents of children who removed
the plastic from the furniture and placed the plastic in their mouth. One
child required medical treatment.</p>

<p>The foam chairs measure 11 inches high, 11 inches wide, and 15.5 inches
deep. The chair's fabric cover features pictures of
animals and children's drawings. A white label which reads in part, "NOW
PRODUCTS INC." and a zipper are located on the bottom
of the chair.</p>

<p>Ames Department stores sold the chairs with matching ottomans and sofas
nationwide from January 1994 through June 1996 for approximately $50. </p>

<p>Consumers should take the chairs away from children until the
chairs have been repaired. For a free repair kit, consumers should call Now
Products at (800) 535-3218, extension 33, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
Central time, Monday through Friday. </p>

<p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public
from unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer
products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information
on CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or
CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To order a press release through
fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and
enter the release number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall
information at CPSC's web site at http://www.cpsc.gov or via Internet gopher
services at cpsc.gov. Consumers can report product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety  
Commission (CPSC), Toy-O-Rama of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif., is 
voluntarily recalling about 33,000 stuffed dogs, mice, bears, and rabbits 
with plastic eyes that come apart from the animals. Young children can 
choke or inhale into their lungs small parts such as the small plastic eyes.
CPSC and Toy-O-Rama are not aware of any injuries involving these toys. 
This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of injury.
The stuffed velour animals measure approximately eight inches long. The 
dark pink dog with a white face and a pink heart applique is holding a red 
satin heart that reads, "Love You." The red mouse with a white head, red 
ears, and a white heart applique is holding a red satin heart that reads, 
"Be Mine." The white bear with black arms and a red velour heart applique 
is holding a red satin heart that reads, "Honey Bunch." Each animal has a 
hang tag that reads, "704-7582." The dog, mouse, and bear were sold 
together from a counter top display labeled in part, "Velour Cuddle 
Pets ... Item #73025." The rabbit, available in yellow, pink, or blue, has 
contrasting color velour accents. The rabbit was sold individually from a 
counter top display labeled in part, "Velour Bunny ... Item #76128." All 
the stuffed animals have black and white sewn-in tags that read in part, 
"TOY-O-RAMA, Made in China." </P>

<P>Chain drug stores, craft stores, and grocery stores, including Genovese 
Drug Stores, H.E.B. Grocery, and Omni Superstores, sold the stuffed 
animals between October 1995 and February 1996 for about $4.</P>
     
<P>Consumers should take the stuffed animals away from children under three 
years old immediately and return the toys to the store where purchased for 
a full refund. For more information, consumers should call Marti Ray of 
Children's Marketing Partners collect at (310) 544-7762. Children's 
Marketing Partners can also be contacted on the Internet at cmkt@aol.com.</P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from the 
unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer 
products under the agency's jurisdiction.  To report a dangerous product 
or a product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand 
service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter 
at (800) 638-8270.  To order a press release through fax-on-demand, call 
(301) 504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release 
number.  Consumers can obtain this release and recall information via 
Internet gopher services at cpsc.gov or report product hazards to 
info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<h3>Growth Record</h3>
</center>

<P>

Your child's doctor or other health care provider will measure your child's height and weight
regularly. Your child's head will also be measured during the first two years of life. These
measurements will help you and your health care provider know if your child is growing properly. Use
this record or growth charts on <a href="/kidsource/content/hg/pg10.html"> pages 10-13 </a>to keep track of your child's growth. If you need help
using these charts, ask your doctor or other health care provider.

<H3>High Blood Pressure</H3>

<P>Your child should have blood pressure measurements regularly, 
starting at around 3 years of age. High blood pressure in children 
needs medical attention. It may be a sign of underlying disease and, 
if not treated, may lead to serious illness.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Your child should be tested for anemia (&quot;low blood&quot;) 
when he or she is still a baby (usually around the first birthday) 
and also may need anemia tests as he or she gets older. Anemia may 
cause your child to grow slowly, tire easily, and get infections more often. 
Anemia in children is usually caused by too little iron in the diet. 
Your child needs to eat iron-rich foods such as meats, green leafy vegetables, 
and iron-fortified cereals.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Check with your child's doctor or health care provider about anemia testing.</P>

<H3>Lead</H3> 
</center>

<br>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Lead can harm your child, slowing physical and mental growth and damaging many parts
of the body. The most common way children get lead poisoning is by being around old
house paint that is chipping or peeling. Some authorities recommend lead tests at 1
and 2 years of age.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Use a check to mark &quot;yes&quot; answers to the questions below. Any
&quot;yes&quot; answers may mean that your child needs lead tests earlier and more
often than other children.</P>

<H3>HAS YOUR CHILD:</H3>


	<p>____ Lived in or regularly visited a house with peeling or chipped paint built
before 1960? (This could include a day care center, preschool, the home of a
babysitter, etc.) </p>

	<p>____ Lived in or regularly visited a house built before 1960 with recent, ongoing,
or planned renovation or remodeling? </p>

	<p>____ Had a brother or sister, housemate, or playmate with lead poisoning? </p>

	<p>____ Lived with an adult whose job or hobby involves exposure to lead (such as
refinishing furniture, making pottery or stained glass, or working in any of the
industries listed in the next question)? </p>

	<p>____ Lived near a lead smelter, battery plant, car repair shop, glass or pipe
factory, or other industry likely to release lead? </p>

<h3>Child Preventive Care Timeline</h3>
</center>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Check-up visits are important for your child's health. Some authorities recommend these visits at the following ages: 2-4 weeks; 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months; and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 years. Your child's doctor or other health care provider will discuss with you the individual needs of your child. At check-up visits, your child may receive a physical examination and the types of preventive care shown below.
</P>

<IMG SRC="prevent.gif">
<BR>
<H3>Please Note </h3>
<p>Children with special risk factors may need more frequent and additional types of preventative care. Some examples:

<h3>Dental/Oral Health</h3>
</center>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Your child needs regular dental care starting at an early age. Talk with your dentist to schedule the first visit. Good oral health requires good daily care. Follow these guidelines.</P>

<H3>For Babies:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>If most of your child's nutrition comes from breast feeding, or you live in an area with too little flouride in the drinking water (less than .3 ppm for children less than 2 years old, less than .7 ppm for children over 2 years old), your child may need fluoride drops or tablets. Ask your health care provider or local water department about the amount of fluoride in your water and note it here:_______ppm.
<LI>Don't use a baby bottle as a pacifier or put your child to sleep with a baby bottle. This can cause tooth decay and ear infections.
<LI>Keep your infant's teeth and gums clean by wiping with a moist cloth after feeding.
<LI>When multiple teeth appear, begin gently brushing your infant's teeth using a soft toothbrush and a small (pea-sized) amount of toothpaste with fluoride.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>For Older Children:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Talk with your dentist about dental sealants. They can help prevent cavities in permanent teeth.
<LI>Using dental floss can help prevent gum disease. Talk with your dentist about when to start.
<LI>Do not permit your child to smoke or chew tobacco. Set a good example and don't smoke yourself.
<LI>If a permanent tooth is knocked out, rinse it gently and put it back in the socket or in a glass of cold milk or water. See a dentist immediately.

<h3>Physical Activity</h3>
</center>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

Adults who are physically active are less likely to become overweight or to have heart disease, high blood pressure, and other diseases. Set a good example for your child---get regular physical exercise yourself.</P>

<CENTER>
<h3>Physical Activity Tips For Children</h3>
</center>

<UL>
<LI>Encourage your child to walk or ride a bicycle to school or to visit friends.
<LI>Plan physical activities with family or friends; exercise is more fun with others.
<LI>Limit the time your child spends watching TV to less than 2 hours per day. Encourage going out to a playground, park, gym, or swimming pool instead.
<LI>Encourage your child to be actively involved in sports, rather than only being an observer. 
<LI>Find out about exercise or sports programs at your child's school or in your community.
<LI>Encourage children with disabilities to participate in physical activities as much as possible.
<LI>Exercise should be fun. Don't make winning the only goal.

<h3>Child Abuse</h3>
</center>
<BR>

<P>Child abuse is a hidden, serious problem.It can happen in any family. The scars,
both physical and emotional, can last for a lifetime. Because children can't
protect themselves, we must protect them.</P>

<BR>

<H3>Ways to Prevent Child Abuse</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
 	<LI>Teach your child not to let anyone touch his or her private parts. 

 	<LI>Tell your child to say &quot;No&quot; and run away from sexual touches. 

 	<LI>Take any reports by your child of physical or sexual abuse seriously.
Report any abuse to your local or state child protection agency. Local Hotline:
	
	<LI>If you feel angry and out of control, leave the room, take a walk, take
deep breaths, or count to 100. Don't drink alcohol or take drugs. These can make
your anger harder to control. 

 	<LI>If you are afraid you might harm your child, get help now! Call someone and
ask for help. Talk with a friend or relative, other parents, or your health care
professional. Take time for yourself. Share child care between parents, trade
baby-sitting with friends, or use day care.

<h3>As Your Child Grows Up</h3>

<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

As your child grows up, he or she will have to begin dealing with many important
health issues not included in the <I>Child Health Guide. </I>Some examples of these
issues are:</P>


<UL TYPE=DISC>
 	<LI>Alcohol 

 	<LI>Drugs 

 	<LI>Tobacco
 
 	<LI>Sexuality 

 	<LI>AIDS
 
 	<LI>Birth Control 
	
</UL>


<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

Talk to your child's doctor or other health care provider about these important
issues - even while your child is still young. You may also get assistance from
authorities listed on the next two pages.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

Start early to teach your child to make responsible choices - not mistakes that can
have a lifelong effect. Take the time to &quot;be there&quot; for your child -
listening, advising, and supporting. The rewards will be well worth the effort.</P>

<H3>Children who read well tend to do well in school.</H3> 
<p>Those
who have trouble  reading, unless helped, generally have trouble with
school. But typically, parents must wait for low grades or notes from the
teacher to find out if their child is having trouble reading.<p>

<p>Now, new research from Boston University and Emerson College in Boston
suggests that a child's performance on certain language tasks may predict
later reading problems. This is true even when these children do not show
clear signs of language difficulties in daily life, say the researchers.<p>

 <p>    "Children who have trouble reading often have underlying
speech and language problems," says Paula Menyuk, professor of
developmental studies and applied linguistics at Boston University.<p>

<p>One hundred eighty children were tested three times between the ages of
1/2 and 7 1/2. The tests examined the children's performance at different
levels of language: sounds, words, sentences, and discourse. Then, when the
children reached first or second grade, they were tested for oral language,
reading, mathematics, and spelling abilities.<p>

<p>In the study, 48 children turned out to have reading problems. The
language tasks used by the Boston researchers in the first part of the
study identified 36 of these children.<p>

<p>Poor performance on three language tasks was an especially good
predictor of later reading problems:<p>

<ul>
<li> <STRONG>understanding complex sentences</STRONG>, such as "The boy who
kissed the girl ran away."
<p>
<li><STRONG>selecting missing words in sentences</STRONG>, such as "The
girls decorated the ______tree." (Christmas, big, bare)
<p>
<li> <STRONG>retrieving words rapidly</STRONG>, for example, quickly naming
a series of 36 unrelated pictures.
</ul>
<p> Some of the children who had reading problems had nothing remarkable in
their developmental histories except very low birthweight (under 1500
grams). Jacqueline Liebergott, professor of communication disorders at
Emerson, speculated that these early medical difficulties may have had an
effect on language development that was not apparent until the children
started to learn to read.<p>

<p>Being able to predict which children will have trouble reading would
allow speech-language pathologists and others to begin to work with them
before they fail, says Menvuk.<p>

<a name="Summary"></a>
<H2>Summary</H2>

<H3>Product description</H3>  Just Grandma and Me is an interactive re-telling of the children's story of the same name by Mercer Mayer.  Each page of the book has been animated, telling the story of Little Critter and his Grandma's trip to the beach.  Children have a choice of having the story read to them, or browsing each page and clicking on hot-spots to discover the animations or sounds.  The CD-ROM is done in 8-bit (256 colors).

<H3>Age level</H3> Broderbund advertises it for grades pre-K to 4 or for ages 3 through 8, but we started playing it with our son when he was under 2 years old.  Even if your child can't use a mouse, it is a beautiful story to interactively tell your children as they sit on your lap. 

<H3>Category</H3>  Early education/interactive storytelling.  By following along as the story is being read, children can learn new words and phrases.  This product is a good way for young computer users to learn hand-eye coordination by  becoming proficient with a mouse.
  
<H3>Overall value</H3>   Yes, this product is worth the money.  If you have young children and are looking for your first CD-ROM title, or one to add to your collection, this is a must-have.

<h3>Support policy </h3> From their on-line forum: "All Broderbund Software is guaranteed for 90 days from the date of shipment to the original purchaser."  For phone technical support they request a"personal product registration" number or the owners manual available to prove ownership.  Broderbund has a wide-range of on-line areas (see below.)<BR><BR>

<a name="Review"></a>
<h2> Review details </h2>

<H3>Review process</H3>  This product has been uses on a series of Macintosh computers, from a Quadra 700 to 800 (these CPU's have the same or lower performance than today's new Apple CPU's for the home), using a 2x CD-ROM drive, 8 or 24-bit graphics support and a 13" or above display.  It has been used on both 7.1 and 7.5 operating systems. We have had the product for about 1 year and has been played with extensively by my son alone (who's now 2.5 years old ) and he and his parents together.

<br><br> We did **NOT** use this on a Windows machine, just our Mac.  If you have questions about Windows support, contact Broderbund directly. See the end of this page for contact information.  
 
<h3>Computer skill level </h3> Depending upon your child's ability to use a mouse, children can begin playing with it  about 2 years of age or older.   Once started, Just Grandma and Me is a "point and click" product, no other computer skills are required.     
  
<H3>Installation and configuration</H3> On our Macintosh,  it worked the first time.  We didn't read any instructions, we just put it in the drive, clicked on the icon and  started playing.  If your monitor is set to other than 8-bit (256 colors) it will ask you if it can change it, and then it changes it back when you are done.   

<H3>Functionality and Performance</H3>   The product advertisements do not do justice to the quality of the animations.  We were pleasantly suprised with how much more the CD had than we expected.  There are ample animations on each page so there is much to keep a child involved.
<br><br>
It does take a while to go from page to page. My 2 year old would begin to lose patience while waiting. Sometimes he would start banging away on the keyboard and would hit a key sequence that would either take it to a different page or would change languages.  (Most of the time, he didn't mind if it read back to him in Japanese. ) The advantage of the long downloads is that once you're on a page, the animation playback is pretty quick. 

<H3>Longevity</H3>   Not only did my son enjoy the CD-ROM, he began to enjoy looking at the book version.  With the many pages and many animations on a page, we had many hours of enjoyment with it.  The duration of each session depends upon your childs attention span, but my son at age 2 could play with it for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.   Now after playing with it for many months, is he moving on to other titles.  I expect that he will come back to this one later when he begins to read.  

<H3>Educational value</H3>   Just Grandma and Me promotes several different types of learning skills. For early readers it reinforces basic reading skills (you can click on a word and it will be read to you, or as it reads the sentences, it highlights the individual words or phrases. For the very young, it helps improve their listening skills and it teachs them about "cause and effect " (I click here with the mouse and something happens there on the screen).  Later, it will aid in basic reading skills.   In the meantime in encourages exploration.

<H3>Design quality</H3>  The design is very rich, with many clever and some unexpected animations using a wide range of sound effects and music themes.   The animations are quite cute and appropriate for young children.

<H3>Usability</H3>   The interface is very consistent and very user friendly. It is a "point and click" interface.   While it is easy for an adult to exit the program, it is not as easy for a very young child, so you can leave them alone while playing (for a little while) and not worry about them going off and erasing your hard disk.   

<br><br>If you set up the program in "read to me" mode, it advances from page (i.e. screen) to page automatically and children can be told the story from beginning to end (this feature is a good for "babysitting" when you need it).   Or you can start the program on any page, by selecting "Options" at the start of the program.  This works well if your child spends a long time on the first few pages and grows tired of them sp you want to begin another session at a later page.

<h3>Kid-Proofness</h3> When it is set up in full-screen mode (the default mode),  the program is isolated from the rest of system until you exit.  Exiting the program requires the user to back out through several different screens, so you can only intentionally exit.  While a determined child who understands the interface will be able to exit in a minute or so, a younger child probably won't.  So depending upon your child's inquisitiveness and level of computer skills, you can decide if you wish to leave your child unattended during play.
There are certain keystroke combinations that will either change the language or change the page, so if your child bangs away at the keyboard, they can have an effect.  But we never found anything that was destructive such as crashing the system.  It's pretty bullet-proof. 

<H3>Social value</H3>  It is an unbiased, non-violent story using animals as key characters. 

<H3>Reliability</H3>  We did not find any problems when we played it on our configurations, or with our system extensions.       

<h3> Technical support </h3> For phone support, Broderbunds want you to have the "personal product registration" number or the owners manual available to show identification.  We also tried the Broderbund on-line forums for information (see below), which is what they recommend if you don't have the identification numbers handy.   When we called tech support to ask how to change the sound level from within the program, they were prompt and quite helpful.  They found us a solution very quickly.  Also, there is a regularly scheduled Technical Support chat scheduled for every Wednesday from 2-4  PM Pacific Standard Time on the CompuServe forum.     

<H3>Fun quotient</H3>  This is a beautiful title that my son enjoyed immensely.  He has been continually suprised by many of the animations and sounds.   Even now we occassionally find a new animation that we hadn't seen before.
  
<H3>Fun things to do</H3>   Don't forget to click on the clouds, sky and water in many scenes.  While there may not be an object there, there often is an animation that shouldn't be missed.

<H3>Other features</H3>   This is one of the few  titles that is multi-lingual. You can select either English, Japanese or Spanish language versions at the start, or by pressing keys 1 (English), 2 (Japanese) or 3 (Spanish) while a screen is loading.  (My son discovered this accidently)   Some have used this feature to introduce the concept of a second language, or for bilingual education.

<br><br> Tech support told us that by hitting "command space-bar", the menu bar appears, giving access to the Apple menu.  This allowed me to get to the sound control panel so I could adjust the sound level from within the program.

<br><br> For educators, they listed " Call Broderbund Software-Direct toll-free at 800-521-6263 for a complimentary copy of our school catalog, "Software for Education," with information on School Editions and Lab Packs. "  

<h3> Wish list </h3> The only wish I have is to have a on-line help feature built in to indentify what the optional key stroke sequences do (such as changing the language options or accessing the menu bar).  Even if they are in a manual, most users won't keep paper documentation around. <BR><BR>

<H2><A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A></H2>

     Long-term good health is less an accident than the result
of good habits and wise choices. To enjoy good health now and
in the future, youngsters must learn how to eat, exercise,
sleep, control stress, and be responsible for personal
cleanliness and reducing the risk of disease. In addition, they
need to be aware of what to do in an emergency and when to say
"no".
<br><br>

     Habits that include eating nutritious foods and
understanding the relationship between physical and emotional
health will help your child grow up healthy. Your child's
ability to learn and the chances for a longer and more
productive life can be greatly improved by developing and
following good health practices.

<H3>First of All, Your Child Is Special</H3>


     The mental and emotional health of your child is just as
important as physical health. From the earliest moment, a child
needs to feel that he or she is special and cared about by
family members and friends.
<br><br>
     A child who enjoys good mental and emotional health is
able to approach new situations with confidence. When children
are comfortable with themselves, they can express their
emotions in a positive way. As children learn to value
themselves and develop confidence in their ability to make
responsible decisions, they are building a sense of self-worth
or self-esteem.
<br><br>
     Parents and teachers share the responsibility for helping
children build self-confidence. A child who is confident is
more successful in everyday interactions with peers and adults.
Confidence in one's ability to learn new and difficult skills
can affect future achievement, as well. Developing a trusting
relationship with your child, establishing open communication,
and recognizing personal achievements are all important. When
children know they can do something well, it makes them feel
special.


<H3>Get Ready, Get Set, Grow Up Healthy</H3>


     From the time your child is born, there are ways in which
you can help your child learn how to grow up healthy. This book
has activities that help children
<br><br>
   <UL>
<LI>understand their emotions and build self-esteem;

<LI>eat the right foods;

<LI>prevent disease;

<li>and build strong bodies.
</UL>

     The book also has safety tips, ways to help your child say
"no" to drugs, a section on parents and the schools, a
bibliography, and a chart to help you keep track of your
child's vaccinations.<BR><BR>

<H2><A NAME="basics">The Basics</A></H2>


<H3>Does This Mean I Can't Eat Ice Cream?</H3>


     Good nutrition does not mean that your children cannot eat
their favorite foods or that they must eat foods they do not
like. Good nutrition means variety and moderation in a person's
diet. Choosing what foods to eat is important in pursuing a
healthy life. Your children may choose to eat certain foods
because they taste good or because they are available. Make
nutritious foods available and monitor the "sometimes"
foods--sugary snacks and fatty desserts.


<H3>I'd Rather Play.</H3>


     Good health is a blend of physical and emotional
well-being. Exercises are basic elements of physical fitness
that should be part of play.
<br><br>
     Aerobic exercises, such as jogging or jumping, that
increase the heartbeat, strengthen the heart and muscles,
improve endurance, condition the total body, and help prevent
disease. Anaerobic, slow, stretching exercises improve
flexibility and muscular fitness. Both types of exercise are
important and fun.



<H3>I'm Afraid and I'm Unhappy.</H3>


     We all face stressful situations. With family members,
with teachers, with friends, and with strangers problems can
arise that make your child feel anxious, nervous, confused, or
frightened. Too much stress or the wrong kind of stress can
make it difficult for children to learn. Helping your child
learn appropriate and healthy ways of handling stress, through
exercise, proper sleep, discussing problems with an adult, or
breaking down jobs into manageable parts, for example, is
important.


<H3>You Sneezed Right in My Face!</H3>


     A healthy lifestyle includes habits that will help your
child avoid diseases caused by germs. Material carrying germs
can be transferred through handshaking, kissing, coughing,
sneezing, or by other means of direct contact. Most shared
items have germs on them. Teaching your child how to reduce the
transmission of germs can help your child, as well as others,
stay healthy.



<H3>I Don't Feel Well!</H3>


     A clean environment will support the health and well-being
of your child now and in the future. You can begin by having a
healthy home that is free of dirt, dust, and germs, as well as
dangerous substances such as radon or lead. Make sure, too,
that poisonous substances, such as household cleaners and
pesticides, are kept away from children. You can also take
precautions in preparing foods by washing them carefully and
cooking them at the recommended temperature. Outside the home,
you can work with others to help combat excessive pollution in
your community.<BR><BR>

<H3>Nutrition and Your Child</H3>



     They went to the cupboard... Today, feeding children is
based on concerns about heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and
high blood pressure. There is reason to be concerned. More than
20 percent of American children are overweight with a good
chance that 50 to 70 percent of them will remain overweight as
adults. It is important for parents to set good examples of
healthful eating. Research shows that children develop eating
habits similar to those of their parents. While it is a
parent's job to provide balanced selections from the five food
groups, children can be allowed a certain amount of freedom to
choose what and how much they eat.
<br><br>
     Poor eating habits and craving for sugar snacks and fatty
foods may develop if parents fail to direct the decisionmaking
process. Remember that the issue isn't "good foods" versus "bad
foods". If children balk at food put before them, don't worry.
Studies show children will, over time, eat the amount of food
that is right for them if they are offered healthful choices.
You can't expect a child to want to eat broccoli if french
fries are offered, or drink milk or orange juice when parents
are drinking sodas. Of course, an occasional high fat food,
gooey dessert, sugary snack, or soda is permissible, provided
they are not substitutes for nutritious foods. Parents can make
eating a pleasure for the entire family by helping create
positive attitudes about food that will lead to a lifetime of
good health.
<br><br>
     What are the five food groups, and how can we help the
entire family eat a balanced diet? The food guide pyramid on
this page shows how to select a balanced diet and how to teach
your child to make wise choices.

<br><br>
  ** Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, teenagers, and
     young adults to age 24 need 3 servings.

<br><br>

     A balanced diet includes food from each of the following
food groups: 
<ul><li>1. grains (bread, cereal, rice, and pasta); 
<li>2.
fruit (fresh, dried, or unsweetened canned); 
<li>3. vegetables (raw
or lightly cooked); 
<li>4. meat (meat, poultry, fish, dried beans,
eggs, and nuts); and 
<li>5. dairy (milk, yogurt, and cheese). 
</ul>
<br>Offer
your children nutritious choices for meals and snacks. This way
you can help them control their own diet. For example, you
might offer a choice of an apple, an orange, or a banana. With
older children (aged 7 and up) you can start by planning a menu
together, letting the children check to make sure it includes
all five food groups.
<br><br>
     Remember that each of the food groups provides some, but
not all, of the nutrients a child needs. Foods in one group
can't replace those in another. No one of these major food
groups is more important than another. For good health, all are
necessary.

  <H3>   What's for breakfast?</H3> Many of us do not eat in the
morning. Estimates suggest that up to 25 percent of all
school-aged children leave the house without breakfast.
<br><br>
     You may think that breakfast is just another meal.
For a child, breakfast provides much needed energy (calories)
to start the day off right. Adults may be able to make up for
skipped breakfast by grabbing something on the way to work or
while doing morning errands. Your child, however, does not have
that opportunity. A nursery school child usually has a
mid-morning snack 3 to 5 hours after waking up. After
kindergarten, few children are offered a morning snack.
<br><br>
     Getting your child to eat breakfast isn't always easy. Try
to tune into your child's morning personality. A sleepyhead may
need a quick breakfast. An early riser may like to eat
breakfast before getting dressed. If this conflicts with your
morning schedule, let your children get their own breakfast.
Even a 6-year-old can open a container of yogurt.
<br><br>

     A good breakfast consists of complex carbohydrates and
simple sugars (breads, whole grains, fiber, fruits, and
vegetables); proteins (dairy, chicken, beef, fish, eggs, nuts,
and dried beans), and some fat. Carbohydrates and simple sugars
offer quick energy but leave the stomach quickly. A breakfast
of only carbohydrates can give a child the mid-morning "blahs".
When milk, cheese, yogurt, lean meat, or an egg is added, the
food stays in the stomach longer and provides sustained energy.


<H3>It's Child's Play</H3>


     Physical fitness is a vital part of being healthy. For
children, being and staying physically fit can happen with
activities they refer to as PLAY! Play that makes them breathe
deeply is aerobic exercise. Aerobic activities such as
bicycling, jumping rope, roller skating, running, dancing, and
swimming can be beneficial if they are done for 12 to 15
minutes without stopping.
<br><br>
     The young child develops an active lifestyle as he or she
begins to creep, crawl, and then walk. Young children learn how
to move in their environment by playing alone in their own
personal space.
<br><br>
     As children grow, they hop, march, run, roll, toss,
bounce, and kick. Their bodies are changing in terms of height
and weight, and they are beginning to form a self-concept
through comparison with others as they move.
<br><br>
     When play is organized into specific movements, it becomes
exercise. For exercise to become part of each day, these
movements or activities should meet the interests and needs of
your child. Play is the beginning. Children can follow their
own paths to lifetime fitness by exercising for fun and at
their own pace.
<br><br>
     Watching too much TV can deprive your child of
opportunities to play and exercise. Set a good example. Limit
TV watching. Walk to your destination as often as possible.
Play active games with your child. Help form neighborhood
sports teams and participate in the recreation.
<br><br>
     Everyone can exercise. Certain exercises keep your heart
and lungs healthy. Strong, flexible muscles can be developed
with exercise. As your child achieves fitness through exercise,
a growing self-confidence will be another benefit of a fitness
routine.


<H3>Let's Stay Well.</H3>


     Reducing the risk of disease is a major goal in helping
your child grow up healthy. Bacteria and viruses cause disease
and sickness, and cleanliness can help prevent the spread of
these germs. Sharing such items as a comb, toothbrush,
hairbrush, or cup, even among family members, can also spread
disease. Having clean clothes and daily baths shows children
that being clean not only feels good, but also helps them stay
well.
<br><br>
     You can teach your children to wash their hands at an
early age. Tell your children that skin can stop germs from
entering the body, and washing can reduce the risk of infection
if your child has a cut or scrape.
<br><br>
     Explain, too, that harmful germs and viruses can be spread
by a sneeze or a cough. Teach your child to stay away from
people who are sneezing and coughing. Children can help prevent
the spread of disease if they cover their sneezes or coughs
with a tissue.
<br><br>
     Everybody has an internal disease fighting system (immune
system) made of antibodies and white blood cells. Your child
can help that immune system function well by getting enough
sleep, by eating nutritious meals, and by exercising.

<br><br>

     Vaccinations also prevent disease and play an important
part in helping your child grow up healthy. The idea of having
a shot may be frightening to a child. Help your child
understand that this vaccination is a medicine that prevents
disease. It's a lot more fun to be playing with friends than to
be sick.
<br><br>
     A vaccination chart for keeping track of immunizations can
be found on the inside front cover. The importance of
vaccinating children at the appropriate ages cannot be
overemphasized.<BR><BR>

     Make a game out of introducing your child to new foods.
<H4>What you'll need</H4>


<UL>
<LI>Paper
<LI>Round object
<LI>Felt tip pen
<li>New foods for your child to sample
</UL>



<H4>What to do</H4>


  <OL>
<LI>Cut paper into three 3"x 3" squares.

  <LI>On each piece of paper, trace around the bottom of a round
     object with a felt tip pen.

  <LI>Have your child draw three different kinds of faces in the
     circles: a face with a smile, an unhappy face, and a face
     with a straight line for a mouth to show "I don't care".

  <LI>Ask your child to try a new or different food. Emphasize
     that not all the portion has to be eaten: simply try the
     food and talk about likes and dislikes.

  <LI>Tell your child to give you one of the faces that reflects
     the feeling about the new food.

  <LI>Post a chart to record new foods your child tries.

  <LI>Set a goal, such as trying one new food a week.

  <LI>Reward your child for trying the foods by writing "Good
     job!" on the chart, putting stickers on the chart, or
     celebrating by taking a trip to the local zoo or library
     when the chart is complete.<BR><BR>
</ol>
<br>

     This activity gives your child a chance to enjoy and learn
about a variety of foods without the pressure of having to
"clean your plate" at mealtime. One point to remember when
doing this activity is to try not to use food as a reward or
bribe.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="follow">Follow the Recipe!</A></H3>

     One way to get children to eat healthful food, especially
vegetables, is to involve them in the selection and preparation
of a recipe.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>


<UL>
<LI>A simple recipe
<LI>Paper and pencil to write a list
<LI>Tray
<li>Utensils and other equipment with which to cook
</UL>



<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <LI>Choose a simple recipe to prepare.<BR><BR>

  <LI>Write a shopping list from the recipe. Check the
     nutritional value of the ingredients by reading the
     nutrition label aloud with your child.<BR><BR>

  <LI>Take the children to the market. The supermarket is the
     perfect place to introduce the older ones to label
     reading. For children over age 6, see who can find the
     products with the most sugars, fats, and salt. Explain
     that the first ingredient listed is what the food has the
     most of. Then, hunt for alternative, healthier foods.<BR><BR>

  <LI>Allow children to feel the weight and texture of
     vegetables. Handling fruits and vegetables will help them
     learn how to distinguish between ripe, unripe, or spoiled
     produce.<BR><BR>

  <LI>Have children help you put away groceries. Preschoolers
     enjoy washing fruits and vegetables, and you can explain
     the proper way to wash them to remove dirt and
     insecticides. Have them store fresh vegetables in the
     refrigerator, explaining this will help retain vitamins
     and help the vegetables stay fresh longer. Have them store
     root vegetables (potatoes and onions) in a cool, dry place
     away from light.<BR><BR>

  <LI>Place all the ingredients you will need for the recipe on
     a tray to make cooking more efficient.<BR><BR>

  <LI>Keep tasks simple and within the child's abilities.
     Toddlers can stir an egg, mix ingredients, spread jams or
     peanut butter, or carry pots and pans. Older children love
     to measure dry ingredients and enjoy the challenge of
     pouring liquids without spilling.<BR><BR>
</ol>


     Pediatricians recommend that parents should get more
involved with their children. What better way than by making a
game out of cooking, a necessary task but one in which everyone
can be involved. Having your children participate in food
selection can help you manage food choices for toddlers,
preschoolers, and elementary school children.<BR><BR>

<a name="potatoes"></a>
<H3>Oven-Fried Potatoes</H3>



     <b>NOTE: This activity requires parental supervision.</b>
<br>
     Here is a healthful recipe that you might want to try.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>


<UL>
<LI>3 medium potatoes, peeled or unpeeled
<LI>2 tablespoons low calorie margarine, melted
<LI>1 1/2 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
<LI>Paprika
<li>Parmesan cheese, grated (optional)
</UL>



<H4>What to do</H4>


  <OL>
<LI>Cut potatoes lengthwise into strips about 4" x 1/2" x 1/4"

  <LI>Arrange in a single layer on a nonstick baking sheet.

  <LI> Pour margarine and oil over potatoes and toss to coat
     well.

  <LI>Sprinkle with paprika (young children enjoy doing this).

  <LI> Bake at 450 degrees for 40 minutes.

  <LI> Put on serving platter; sprinkle with cheese if desired.
</ol><br>
     Makes 6 servings <br><br>

     <H4>Safety tips in the kitchen:</H4> Children should not be left
unsupervised when electrical appliances, flame, or heat are
involved. Be extra careful with moving equipment, such as
rotary blades of a mixer, food processor, blender, or hand
mixer. Knives, scissors, and the like are best for older
children. Remind children that handles of utensils on a stove
top should be turned inward. Stirring spoons (especially metal
ones) should have long handles and be kept away from the heat.
Keep an eye on children near stoves, no matter what age and
keep small children away from heat of any kind.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="sticks">Sticks and Stones Snack</A></H3>

     Here is a snack that your children will have fun making
and enjoy eating while getting needed nutrients.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>


<UL>
<LI>4 cups of cereal (Kix or some type of low sugar cereal)
<LI>2 cups of pretzel sticks
<LI>2 cups of raisins
<li>Mixing bowl
</UL>


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Mix the cereal, pretzel sticks, and raisins in a mixing
     bowl.

  <li> Eat as a "between meal" snack. Makes about 8 cups.
</ol>


     This recipe was adapted from Kid's Recipe Magic, 1990,
General Mills, Minneapolis, Minnesota, p. 15.
<br><br>
     The food guide pyramid shows that children need about 9
servings a day from the bread and cereal group and 3 servings
of fruits. This snack can help meet these nutritional
requirements.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="Brushhhh">Brushhhh!</A></H3>



     Playing and singing with children can help make tooth
brushing an enjoyable experience.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>


<UL>
<LI>Toothbrush (child sized in a favorite color or with a favorite
cartoon character on it)
<LI>Toothpaste (you might try toothpastes especially made for
children)
<LI>Wash cloth for young children
<li>Children's dental floss.
</UL>


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <LI>When it is time for your children to brush their teeth,
     sing a silly song together about tooth brushing:

     <UL>
<LI>This is the way we brush our teeth,
<LI>     Brush our teeth,
<LI>     Brush our teeth,
<LI>     This is the way we brush our teeth,
<li>     So early in the morning!
</UL>

  <LI>Make sound effects--"ZOOM, ZOOM, ZOOM .... or VROOM,
     VROOM, VROOM" when you watch them brush.

  <LI>Have your children name their teeth and use their names:
     "Now don't forget Cutters, Doggies, and Chompers!"
     (Children often find it interesting that dentists call
     some teeth "canines.")

</ol>

     Before your baby even has teeth, clean the gums with a wet
cloth after feeding. When teeth start to come in, brush with a
soft toothbrush and water. At about age 3, teach your child to
brush as follows: start at the gum and gently massage under the
gum, then work the toothbrush around the teeth in a gentle,
circular motion. Floss teeth daily when all the baby teeth are
in.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="share">To Share or Not To Share?</A></H3>

     Telling the difference between personal items that should
not be shared and those things that are to be shared can be a
hard distinction for children to make.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>


<UL>
<LI>Newspapers or magazines
<LI>Large pieces of paper
<LI>Glue
<LI>Red pen or marker
<li>Scissors
</UL>


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Have your child collect pictures of a toothbrush, cup,
     comb, hairbrush, and spoon or fork from newspapers or
     magazines.<BR><BR>

  <li> Ask your child to paste the pictures on a large piece of
     paper.<BR><BR>

  <li> With a red felt tip marker or pen, have your child put an
     X or \ through each picture.<BR><BR>

  <li>Title the poster, "Things I Do Not Share".<BR><BR>

  <li>Have your child collect pictures of objects that he or she
     does share. These can be pictures of toys, pets, and
     books.<BR><BR>

  <li> Use these pictures to make a poster with the title "Things
     I Share".<BR><BR>
</ol>


     Remind your children that disease is spread by the hands
and through the mouth, so they shouldn't share toothbrushes,
cups, spoons, or forks. head lice are spread by combs and
brushes. Working with your child to make the posters will help
you explain these points, while emphasizing that there are many
things we can share.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="me">I Do It For Me</A></H3>

     How can I take care of myself? Here is an activity that
will take advantage of your child's growing independence while
emphasizing healthful responsibility.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>


<UL>
<LI>Paper
<li>Marker or crayon
</UL>

<H4>What to do</H4>

  <oL>
<LI>With your child, make a chart that lists healthful
     responsibilities:

     <UL>
<LI>I take a bath.
<LI>I wear clean clothes.
<LI>I brush my teeth at least twice each day.
<LI>I wash my hair.
<LI>I wash my hands before eating.
<LI>I wash my hands after going to the bathroom.
<LI>I use my own brush or comb and don't let anyone else use it.
<li>I get plenty of sleep.


     <li>The list can include other items that you and your child
     think should be on the list.
</UL>
  <li> Make a box for each day of the week after each
     responsibility.

  <li>Have your child check off the things done each day.

  <li>At the end of the week, write WOW over the
     responsibilities or place a sticker over those completed
     during the week.<BR><BR>
</ol>


     It is important that children learn to take responsibility
for the care of their bodies. Having a chart helps them develop
self-reliance and helps to make life calmer for both of you.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="hold">Hold that Tiger!</A></H3>

     Children love animals and they love to imitate. Combine
these two interests to inspire exercise.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Magazines or newspapers
<LI>Cardboard or paper
<LI>Paste or glue
<LI>Scissors
<li>An open space in which to move
</UL>

<H4>What to do</H4>


  <oL>
<LI>Collect pictures of different animals.
 <LI> Paste each picture on a different piece of cardboard.
 <LI> Place the cards face down on a table and mix them up.
 <LI> Have your child select a card and turn the card over to
     reveal the animal picture on the other side.
  <LI> Have your child imitate the movements of the animal on the
     card. For example:

      <UL>
<LI>rabbit: hop
     <LI>horse: gallop
     <LI>turtle: crawl
     <LI>elephant:   slow lumbering walk, clasp hands together and
                swing arms side to side like a trunk.
     <LI>frog :      leap
     <LI>tiger:      fluid, smooth, sliding steps
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="warm">Warm Up</A></H3>


     Use one or more of the following exercises to have your
child warm up before doing more vigorous exercises.
<br><br>
     All exercises have been adapted from Get Fit!, published
by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 701
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 250, Washington, DC 20004.


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li> Arm Circles. Stand tall with knees slightly bent. Rise on
     your toes and slowly circle your arms inward and upward,
     until arms are straight over head. Inhale deeply. Continue
     circling your arms backward and downwards while lowering
     your heels and exhaling. Do this exercise slowly and
     smoothly. Repeat 5 times.<BR><BR>

  <li> Swinging March. Stand up straight with feet shoulder-width
     apart, hands at your sides. Alternate right and left arms
     in forward circle motions. At the same time, lift your
     opposite knee so that when the right arm is circling
     forward the left knee is raised and vice versa. Do 10
     complete circles with each arm and then switch arms to
     swing backward. Repeat 10 full circles with each arm.<BR><BR>

  <li> Pendulum Push. Stand straight with arms at your side. Step
     to right, bending your right knee. Raise arms overhead and
     push toward the ceiling. At the same time, rise on your
     right toes and lift your left leg off the ground, keeping
     all the weight on the right foot. Put your left leg back
     on the ground, bending both knees and placing hands on
     shoulders. Repeat to the left side. Repeat 10 times on
     each side.<BR><BR>

  <li> Jumping Jacks. Stand straight with feet together. Jump up
     and land with your feet shoulder-width apart as you swing
     arms to shoulder height. Jump back to starting position
     while clapping your hands over your head. Jump up and land
     with feet apart while bringing your arms back to shoulder
     height. Jump back to starting position while lowering arms
     to your sides. Repeat this 4-part jumping jack 10-20 times
     at a slow, controlled pace.<BR><BR>
</ol>

     Children should warm up their bodies for about five
minutes to get muscles and joints ready for action and to
prevent injury. They will be warmed up when they start to sweat
and breathe heavier.<BR><BR>
<a href="#contents2">Back to the Activities Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<H3><A NAME="stretch">Stretch</A></H3>

     Muscles should be stretched after they've been warmed up.

<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li> Back Scratch Stretch. Have your child stand or sit to do
     this exercise. Raise the right hand in the air with the
     palm facing to the back. Bend the elbow and place the palm
     of the hand on the back between the shoulders. Bring the
     left hand behind the back to try to touch the right hand.
     Hold 10-30 seconds. Repeat two times on each side. Do not
     force the stretch.<BR><BR>

  <li> Knee High Stretch. While standing, lift left knee toward
     chest. Place left hand under knee and pull leg up to
     stretch the back of leg and lower back. Keep the standing
     leg slightly bent. Hold for 10-30 seconds. Repeat twice on
     each side.<BR><BR>

  <li> Thigh Stretch. Keeping body upright, grasp left foot
     behind you with left hand. Slowly pull leg back so that
     the knee moves away from your body until you feel a
     stretch in the front of your leg. Hold 10-30 seconds.
     Repeat twice with each leg.<BR><BR>

  <li> Calf Stretch. With hands against a wall, put right
     leg behind you. Keep right heel on the floor and very
     slightly bend the right knee. Lean forward until you feel
     a pull in your calf and behind your ankle. Hold 10-30
     seconds. Repeat twice with each leg.<BR><BR>
</ol>

     Stretching helps prevent muscles and joints from getting
injured. Stretching makes the body more flexible so your child
will be able to move easily. Stretching also helps your child
relax.<BR><BR>
<a href="#contents2">Back to the Activities Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<H3><A NAME="run">Run For It!</A></H3>

     After you've warmed up and stretched, you're ready to run.

<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li> Beginner. Jog 2 minutes/walk 1 minute for a total of 15
     minutes. Repeat. Do this at least three times a week.<BR><BR>

  <li> Intermediate. Jog 4 minutes/walk 1 minute. Do this for
     about 15-20 minutes at least three times a week. After
     about two weeks, reduce the amount of walking to 30
     seconds. Gradually build up to about 30 minutes using this
     pattern.<BR><BR>

  <li> Advanced. Continuously jog for 20 minutes. If you like
     jogging, you can run for longer periods time.<BR><BR>
</ol>

     Aerobic activities strengthen your child's heart and lungs
by requiring lots of oxygen and making the heart beat faster.
Walking, swimming, running, and dancing are examples of aerobic
exercises.
<a href="#contents2">Back to the Activities Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<H3><A NAME="going">Keep Going!</A></H3>

     These exercises will help your child build muscle strength
and endurance.

<H4>What to do</H4>

  <ol>
  <li> Push Ups. Get down on your hands and knees and position
     yourself so that your back is straight, head in line with
     your spine. Hands should be placed slightly outside your
     shoulders, fingers pointed forward, feet on the ground.
     Slowly lower your body until your chest touches the floor.
     Return to starting position. Once you can do 20-25 push
     ups with your knees bent, advance to the straight-leg
     position on your hands and toes. Try to do 10 straight-leg
     push ups at a time.<BR><BR>

  <li> Curl Ups. Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat
     on the floor. Place your arms across your chest, hands on
     opposite shoulders. Slowly curl your head, shoulders, and
     upper back off the floor, bringing elbows to thighs.
     Breathe out as you curl up and return to starting position
     while breathing in. Repeat 10 times. You might find it
     helpful to have someone hold your feet to the ground.<BR><BR>
</ol>

     Curl Ups build strong stomach muscles, and Push Ups build
strong arm muscles.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="cool">Cool Down</A></H3>

     After doing aerobic or muscle exercises, your child is
ready to cool down.
             
<H4>What to do</H4>


  <ol>
  <li> Have your child walk around for a few minutes to make sure
     breathing is back to normal and that the heart is NOT
     beating fast.<BR><BR>

  <li> Your child should feel slightly relaxed when it is time to
     do stretches.<BR><BR>

  <li> Doing the stretching exercises given on previous pages or
     others, have your child stretch all major joints and
     muscle groups, especially those used in the workout.<BR><BR>

  <li> Have your child work on flexibility, since it's easier to
     stretch warm muscles.<BR><BR>
</ol>

     Children should cool down after vigorous exercise to get
their breathing back to normal. Cooling down also keeps muscles
from becoming sore and stiff.<BR><BR>

<a name="More"></a>
<H2>More Ideas</H2>
     Here are some more ideas that will help your child grow up
healthy.


<H3><A NAME="safety">Safety First</A></H3>


     Be aware of ways to prevent accidents and be able to
identify how accidents are caused. Teach your children to pick
up toys off the floor and stairs. When cooking, try to use the
back burners, making sure that pot handles and spoons are
turned toward the back of the stove. Use safety latches on
cabinets that contain cleaning fluids or knives and other
dangerous utensils. Cover electrical outlets with plastic
devices made for this purpose. And always be sure to keep an
eye out for your children!

<br><br>

     Identify safety rules and practices to prevent accidents
at home, at school, and during recreational activities. Look
for playground and swimming pool rules that give safety
precautions, and explain them to your children. Make sure your
child wears safety equipment for specific activities: a helmet
when riding a bike and knee and elbow pads when roller skating,
roller blading, or skate boarding. Have your child practice
hand signals while bike riding. For the car, make a "Buckle
Your Seat Belt" sign and place it where children can see it.
<br><br>
     Be aware of peer pressure. Observe your children in social
situations, and listen closely when they talk with you about
things that happen at school or on the playground. Get to know
the parents of your children's friends and try to attend as
many functions in which your child is involved as you can.
<br><br>
     Teach your children how to protect themselves. Have them
practice saying "No." Tell them not to talk to strangers, to
always walk with a friend, and to avoid isolated areas such as
woods or vacant lots. If your child is followed by a car, he or
she should run away to a friend or neighbor's house. Teach your
children to be alert and to scream if someone grabs them. Keep
the lines of communication open, so that your children will
tell you if someone touches them in a way that makes them feel
uncomfortable. Work with your school and neighborhood to have
the police brief your children about safety precautions and
start a "safe home" program where neighbors display a sign in
the window to show children that if they are in danger they can
go to that house.


<H3>Response to Emergencies</H3>


     Recognize and lean appropriate responses to emergency
situations, such as fires, lightning, tornadoes, and
earthquakes. Teach your children the proper uses of fire and
fire safety. Plan a home fire escape with your children and
practice it often. Also, show children what to do if their
clothes catch fire (STOP where you are, DROP to the ground, and
ROLL to put out the flames). Make sure your children know how
to dial the emergency number 911. Post it and other emergency
numbers near the telephone where they will be easily seen. In
the event of a tornado, teach your children that the safest
place to go is the basement or interior room or hallway on the
bottom floor of the house. In an earthquake, teach children to
get under a desk or table, and stay away from windows. If your
children are outside during a storm and there is lightning,
teach them not to stand under or near a tree. Trees tend to
attract lightning, because they are so tall

<H3>First Aid</H3>


     The best rule of thumb is, "When in doubt, call the
doctor." Know the symptoms that require a doctor's care:
intense pain, high fever, excessive bleeding, unconsciousness,
difficulty breathing. Emphasize to your children that the best
way to care for a minor cut or scrape is to wash it with soap
and water and cover with a bandage if the cut is bleeding or
will be exposed to dirt. If possible, take a first aid course
from the American Red Cross, your local YM/YWCA, rescue squad,
or other organization to learn the procedures in
life-threatening situations, such as choking or poisoning. Some
doctors have free pamphlets or video tapes on first aid and
what to do in case of emergency.<BR><BR>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<H3><A NAME="platter">And They Licked the Platter Clean</A></H3>
<ul>
   <li>If your child won't try vegetables, mix finely grated raw
     carrots with peanut butter and use as a spread for
     crackers, bread, apple slices, or bananas.

   <li>Puree an egg or egg substitute with cooked or defrosted
     frozen vegetables and grated cheese. Cook the mixture the
     same as you would scramble eggs.

   <li>Serve vegetables as a first course on a colorful,
     child-oriented plate and then serve the meat or fish as
     the second course to be eaten after the vegetables are
     finished.

   <li>Make edible art. Use the plate as the background and have
     each child add applesauce for clouds, shredded lettuce for
     grass, celery sticks for a stem, carrot rounds for
     flowers, orange slices for leaves, raisins for rocks, and
     any other edible ingredients for natural scenes.

   <li>Most toddlers need to eat more often than older children.
     Give them favorite, high energy foods and quick and
     convenient snacks such as slices of fruit and raw
     vegetables, whole grain breads, crackers, and cereals, or
     chunks of cheese.

   <li>Encourage your children to enjoy and learn about a variety
     of foods. All foods can fit into a healthy diet over time.

   <li>Introduce new foods to preschoolers. They are more willing
     to try them and will enjoy practicing their skills with
     fork and spoon.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="free">Growing Up Drug Free</A></H3>


     From the time your child is born, there are things you can
do to help your child grow up drug, alcohol, and tobacco free.
Here are some guidelines.
<br>
<ul>
   <li>Take precautions with medicines and harmful household
     products.

   <li>Respect your child's feelings.

     consistent.

   <li>Set aside time to be with your child.

   <li>Guide your child's activities. Know where your child is at
     all times and get to know your child's friends.

   <li>Set the example for your child.

   <li>Have drug, alcohol, and tobacco free parties and
     activities in your home.

   <li>Learn about the school's drug policy.

   <li>Ask for help if you need it.

     The school can be a vital link to your child's well-being.
So much of your child's life is spent in school, it is
important that you be aware of all the people and situations
involved. Besides the school nurse (who may not be at the
school full time), there are many resources you can call on.
<br><br>
     Teachers are aware of the whole child and things that
might be getting in the way of your child's learning. School
counselors can advise on your child's social and emotional
well-being. Many school counselors concentrate on helping
children build self-esteem, and some work with groups of
children with similar problems, such as coping with a divorce
or death in the family.
<br><br>
     Physical education classes provide an opportunity for
exercise, and they foster teamwork. The school cafeteria is a
source of well-balanced lunches (and breakfasts in some school
districts), many of which are government-subsidized for low
income students. The principal and teacher can advise on
special services provided by the school district for children
with handicaps and special learning needs.
<br><br>
     The most important thing you can do is stay in contact
with the school, especially your child's teacher. Listen
carefully to the teacher, because the teacher will often spot
problems or warning signs of serious trouble before you might
notice them.
<br><br>
     It is also important for you to tell the teacher if your
child has a serious health problem or is experiencing an
emotional crisis at home. It is imperative for the school to
know if your child is on medication and what it is, who should
be contacted in case of an emergency, and what to look for in
your child's behavior that might be a warning sign of the onset
of a medical emergency.
<br><br>
     Your child's welfare is a partnership between the parent
and the school. If a serious medical condition exists, private
or community health services should be consulted.


<H4>What can you expect of the school?</H4>


     The following information has been adapted from Managing
Asthma: A Guide for Schools, published by the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of
Education.

<H4><I>The principal should:</I></H4>

  <UL>
<LI>give parents a clear policy on taking medication during
school hours.
<LI>provide opportunities for staff to learn about medical
emergencies.
<LI>establish a resource file on health issues for teachers
and staff to read.
<LI>schedule building repairs, cleaning, or painting when
students are out of the building during vacations or the
 summer.
</UL>

<H4>    <I> The school nurse should:</I></H4>

<UL>
<LI>maintain health records on all students with chronic
 diseases.

<LI>alert staff members about students with serious health
 conditions.

<LI>inform parents if they suspect a serious health problem.

<LI>administer medication according to school policy.

<LI>Work with the parent/teacher organization to provide
educational programs on medical conditions that affect a
large number of students.
</UL>

    <H4><I> The teacher should:</I></H4>

   <UL>
<LI>know the early waning signs of a medical emergency.

<LI>develop a clear procedure for handling schoolwork missed
due to illness.

<LI>understand the side effects of medication, for example,
drowsiness, anxiety, withdrawal.

<LI>educate classmates about special medical conditions of
 students in the class, while respecting confidentiality. 

<LI>reduce health hazards in the classroom.

<LI>encourage students with health problems to participate in
classroom activities as much as possible.

<LI>allow a student to do quiet activities if a medical
condition prevents full participation.
</UL>
<br>
     These are just some of the actions that school personnel
can take to make the school a safer and friendlier place for
your child. Remember that when children are well and
comfortable, they learn more.<BR><BR>

<P>NEW YORK, NY --  New warning labels on toys that could
choke small children will mean a safer holiday season
according to an announcement made today by Consumer Product
Safety Commission Chairman Ann Brown.</P>

<P>     Standing before a huge display of toys at FAO Schwartz,
Chairman Brown displayed the new warning labels and said
that adults will now have new information to help them
choose toys that are safe for children.  Brown was joined by
officials from Prevention Magazine, which released a survey
on toy safety.</P>

<P>     "These warning labels will appear on all toys made for
children from three to under six years old if those toys
pose a choking hazard to younger children," Brown said. 
"These labels tell parents two critical things: They let
them know that a toy isn't safe for children under three,
and why its not safe."</P>

<P>     The labels are required to be on all toys marketed for
children from three years old to under six years old and
manufactured after January 1, 1995, if those toys present a
choking hazard to children under three.</P>

<P>     "Before now, parents and grandparents had no way of
knowing that the toys they bought for older children could
be a danger to younger kids," Brown said.  "Now they will
have that information right in the store, and will be able
to make a purchase based on safety.  In addition, they will
be able to buy a toy for an older child, knowing that they
need to keep that toy away from younger children at home."</P>

<P>     According to figures released by the CPSC, 5,000
children were taken to hospital emergency rooms in 1994 for
aspirating or ingesting toys and parts of toys.  Since 1980,
nearly 200 children choked to death on balloons, marbles and
small balls -- toys now covered by these new CPSC labeling
requirements.</P>
<P>     In 1994, CPSC had reports of 18 toy-related deaths. 
Thirteen of those deaths were associated with choking.</P>

<P>      "These deaths were not only tragic, they were
preventable." Brown said. "We want people to use these
choking hazard warning labels to help them know which toy is
safe for which child. We hope the information we are giving
out here today will help protect our children, and make this
a better holiday for everyone."</P>

<P>     During her remarks, Brown stressed the CPSC's
commitment to toy safety throughout the year -- not only
during the holidays.  She cited figures showing the CPSC
recalled 10 million toys and children's products in 1994,
and had stopped three quarters of a million unsafe toys from
being imported into the United States.</P>

<P>          The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
protects the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or
death from 15,000 types of consumer products under the
agency's jurisdiction.  To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's
fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772
or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270.  To order a
press release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051
from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release
number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall
information via Internet gopher services at cpsc.gov or
report product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<H3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></H3>

     Throughout history, <B>lead in food and drink</B> has been
<B>synonymous with disaster</B>. Historians suspect that some ancient
empires rambled when leaders became deranged or died of
poisoning because they used lead to sweeten wine, drank from
lead-lined aqueducts, and used utensils made with lead-based
clays and paints.<br><br>

     These days, knowledge of the dangers of lead poisoning
keeps manufacturers and governments vigilant about the amounts
that get into food. Small amounts of lead leach from glazes and
decorative paints on ceramic dinnerware, from lead crystal.
and less frequently, from pewter and silver-plated hollowware.
Also, because lead is generally in the environment, it makes
its way into food through soil and water.<br><br>

     The <B>levels</B> of lead in food and drink <B>today are the lowest
in history</B>--90 percent lower than 12 years ago. This is mostly
due to the U.S. food industry's voluntary elimination of lead
solder to seal the seams of food cans and the removal of lead
from automobile gasoline that settled on crops and in water.<br><br>

     But concern still remains about lead leaching into food
from ceramic ware, especially mugs. While analyzing risks from
dietary lead, FDA scientists found that about 80 percent of
adult exposure to lead from food in contact with ceramic
hollowware comes from frequent or daily use of mugs for hot
beverages.<br><br>

     For pregnant women, plain glass or plastic mugs may be a
safer bet than ceramic mugs when drinking hot acidic beverages
on a daily basis.<br><br>



     In a February 1992 report to the Society of Toxicology,
FDA scientists Clark D. Carrington, Ph.D., P. Michael Bolger,
Ph.D., and Robert J. Scheuplein, Ph.D., said there can be a
substantial incremental risk to a developing ferns from lead
leaching into food from ceramic hollow-ware. (See accompanying
article, "Danger-Even at Low Levels.") (Note: this article isn't available on KidSource OnLine)<br><br>

<H3><a name="Guidelines">Guidelines for Consumers</a></H3> 

    Antiques and other collectibles may look attractive, but
this type of dinner ware is more likely to leach lead than that
made more recently.<br><br>

     Consumers can guard against exposure to lead in food by
observing the following guidelines:<br><br>

 <UL>
<LI>If you are pregnant, avoid the daily use of ceramic mugs
     when drinking hot beverages such as coffee or tea, and
     avoid the daily use of lead crystal ware.

<LI>Do not feed babies from lead crystal bottles.

<LI>Do not store acidic foods such as fruit juices in ceramic
   containers.

<LI>Do not store beverages in lead crystal containers.

<LI>Limit the use of antique or collectible housewares for
     food or beverages to special occasions.

<LI>Stop using items that show a dusty or chalky gray residue
     on the glaze after they are washed

<LI>Follow I label directions on any ornamental product with a
     warning such as, "Not for Food Use -- Plate May Poison
     Food. For Decorative Purposes Only."

<LI>If your wine is sealed with a foil capsule, wipe the rim
     of the bottle with a cloth dampened with water or lemon
    juice before removing the cork.<BR><BR>

<H3><a name="Testing Kits">Testing Kits</a></H3>

     FDA is aware of three kits to test for lead leaching from
ceramic ware that consumers can use at home. These kits are not
always sensitive enough to detect lead at the new lower levels,
but they can be valuable for identifying items that release
larger amounts of lead. For information about these kits and
other questions about lead, contact the local FDA office,
listed in the blue pages of the phone directory, or call FDA
headquarters at (301) 443-4667.<br><br>

<H3><a name="Toll Free">Toll Free Phone for More Info</a></H3>

     The National Safety Council, under a grant from the
federal government, maintains a National Lead Information
Center with a toll-free number -- (1-800) LEAD-FYI, or (1-800)
532-339 -- where callers may request a Spanish or English
language information package. Also, most U.S. ceramic
manufacturers maintain toll-free lines through which consumers
may obtain information about lead levels in their products.
Public affairs specialists in FDA district offices can provide
consumers with these numbers.<br><br>


     Once lead enters the body, it is assimilated in the
bloodstream in the same manner as calcium.<br><br>


     Hot acidic beverages such as coffee and tea, both
caffeinated and decaffeinated, cause the greatest leaching. FDA
toxicologists agree that pregnant women should avoid daily
drinking of hot coffee or tea or other hot acidic beverages,
such as tomato soup, from lead-glazed ceramic cups or mugs.
However, the occasional use of these pieces is not a problem,
even during pregnancy.<br><br>

     Consumers also need to be aware of the potential for lead
to leach from ceramic plates, bowls and pitchers. Glaze,
improperly formulated or fired, can leach large quantifies of
lead into food. Consumers who suspect a ceramic product has
been improperly glazed or fired, should avoid using it for
food, or should test the piece for excessive lead leaching
before using it (see accompanying article, "Advice for 
Consumers").<br><br>

     Responsible manufacturers of ceramic ware use all the
proper precautions, but even with properly glazed pieces, low
amounts of lead may migrate into food. FDA advises consumers to
avoid storing acidic beverages, such as fruit juices and iced
tea, in lead-glazed pitchers because, even cold, acidic
beverages have a greater tendency than other foods to cause
leaching of lead.<br><br>

<H3><a name="New Action Levels">New Action Levels</a></H3>



     Recent studies on the effects of lead on the fetus,
infants, toddlers, and adults in amounts well below those
previously believed harmful prompted FDA to reduce its action
levels (guidelines telling industry at what point FDA may take
regulatory action) for lead leaching from all ceramic
hollowware. The action levels specify how much lead may leach
from the ceramic piece into a special test solution during a
24-hour test at room temperature. This was the third reduction
since action levels for lead leaching from ceramic ware were
first set in 1971.<br><br>

     The new action levels are based primarily on how
frequently a type of ceramic ware is used, the type of food it
holds, the temperature of the food, and how long the food comes
in contact with the ceramic ware. For example, a coffee mug is
generally used every day to hold a hot acidic beverage, often
several times a day, and a pitcher could be used to store fruit
juice. Cups and mugs were put into a separate category, and
they, along with pitchers, were given an action level of 0.5
parts per million, the lowest for all ceramic ware.<br><br>

     Manufacturers of materials used by ceramic hobbyists and
handicrafters are aware of lead contamination problems, and
label their products with special instructions. Public affairs
specialists in FDA district offices work with state health
officials and organizations to develop special education
materials for handicraft and pottery associations to avoid
potential sources of lead exposure that fall beyond FDA
regulatory control.<br><br>

     In addition, FDA has notified embassies in Washington,
D.C., of the new action levels so that foreign manufacturers
and exporters will have the necessary information to meet the
new levels. FDA samples and tests for lead leaching from
imported and domestic ceramic ware sold in this country, but
the agency cannot check it all. For example, products that
enter the country through informal channels, such as those
brought by travelers from abroad, are not monitored by FDA.<br><br>

     Because of its heightened focus on ceramic ware, in
February 1992, FDA inspectors in every port in the country
conducted a short-term intense surveillance of ceramic products
used for food, ranging from fine bone china to inexpensive
imported pottery. Assisted in many cases by state authorities,
FDA inspectors examined more than 5,000 lots of ceramic ware
from 29 countries. Nearly 700 lots of domestic ceramic ware
from approximately 90 firms were also examined. The results
were encouraging. Using the best screening methods available,
FDA examiners found that only about 1 percent of imported and 3
percent of domestic ceramic ware exceeded the action levels.
(See "New Initiatives for Import Safety," FDA Consumer, October
1992.)<br><br>

     FDA also has taken new regulatory steps to ensure that
lead continues to stay at lowest possible levels in food. On
Nov. 25, 1992, the agency published in the Federal Register a
proposed regulation that would prohibit the use of tin-coated
lead foil capsules (coverings for the cork and neck area) on
wine bottles because lead from the capsule may get into the
wine. Another proposal, published Jan. 5, 1993, would set a
limit for lead in bottled water of no more than 5 parts per
billion. And FDA intends to propose a regulation that would
prohibit lead solder in food cans. The prohibition would also
apply to imports-food in lead-soldered cans would not be
allowed to enter the country.<br><br>

     On April 1, 1993, FDA published interim action levels for
lead in food packaged in lead-soldered containers. Products
that exceed these levels are subject to regulatory action,
including recalls. The interim action levels will be in effect
until FDA can permanently ban lead-soldered food cans.<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<H3><a name="Lead and Cans">Lead and Cans</a></H3>



     Before the U.S. canning industry voluntarily eliminated
the use of lead in solder to seal food cans, FDA estimates that
from 14 to 45 percent of lead in food came from such seals.
During the food packaging process, the can body, with its side
seam mechanically crimped together, passed over a pot of molten
solder, where a rotating roll transferred solder to the seam.
The excess solder was then wiped from the can, and the can was
cooled until the solder was set. Although solder was not
applied to the inside of the can, some of it had to bleed
through the ends of the side seam to make a strong, leakproof
can. The minute amount of solder that bled through the seam
later leached into the food inside. Sometimes, more lead would
contaminate the can's inner surface from the solder dust in the
vicinity of the solder pot or splashes from the wiping station.<br><br>

     As more information on lead toxicity became available, the
canned food industry consulted with FDA on ways to make a safer
product. In response, industry voluntarily switched to unseamed
cans and to sealing can seams with nonlead-solder techniques,
such as forge and wire welding.<br><br>

     The industry voluntarily stopped packaging infant formula
in lead-soldered cans in 1982, according to information
submitted to FDA by the Infant Formula Council. As for all of
the other canned foods, the Can Manufacturers Institute
informed FDA that as of November 1991, lead-soldered cans were
no longer produced in the United States. But lead-soldered cans
are permitted in some countries that export canned food to us.<br><br>

     The interim action levels published this April primarily
affect imported food. FDA estimates that up to 10 percent (some
230 million pounds) of food imported each year may be packaged
in lead-soldered cans. Some ethnic groups use imported canned
foods as staples in their diets. Also, food in lead-soldered
cans may enter the United States through individual purchases
outside the United States. A 1991 San Diego County screening
program for lead in children's blood led to detection by the
Board of Health of a dangerously high blood-lead level in a
1-year-old child whose parents had brought back fruit juice in
lead-soldered cans from a grocery store across the Mexican
border. Investigators found that the same product had entered
the United States through import channels. The juice products
were recalled nationwide (see 'Toddler's Blood Test Leads to
Juice Recall" in the Investigators' Reports section of the
December 1992 FDA Consumer.)<br><br>

foil capsules into wine, wipe the bottle rim and top of the
cork with a cloth dampened with water or lemon juice.<br><br>


     The upcoming FDA proposal to prohibit the use of
lead-soldered food cans would prevent such incidents. As an
additional measure, FDA has sent letters to more than 65
countries to inform them of FDA's concerns and to learn about
their regulations on lead-soldered food cans. Many of the
countries that responded are aware of the problems with lead
solder in food cans and have established their own lead limits
or have adopted those set by the World Health Organization. FDA
urges exporters to stop manufacturing lead-soldered food cans,
and has made its concerns known through these letters and other
discussions at world forums over the last few years.<br><br>

<H3><a name="Wine Bottles">Foil Capsules on Wine Bottles</a></H3>



     Many imported and domestic wines have lead foil capsules
(coated on both sides with a thin layer of tin) covering the
cork and neck of the bottle. The capsule is used to prevent
insect infestation of the cork area and as an oxygen barrier.
It's also used to impart an image and feel that are perceived
as important to product differentiation and to the marketing of
fine wines.<br><br>

     Data on the lead content in wine with lead foil seals were
developed by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
(ATF). Higher lead levels were found in samples of wines poured
from the bottle than in unpoured samples. The ATF report
concluded that "significant lead contamination" could result if
the wine seeps between the cork and the wrap or capsule,
causing the foil seal to corrode and leave lead salt deposits
on the rim. Although the lead levels found do not pose a
short-term health hazard, FDA's concern is with long-term
exposure for individuals who regularly consume wine.<br><br>

     Based on these findings, FDA proposed a regulation to
declare lead foil wraps for wines to be a food additive that is
unsafe, and further to prohibit the use of such wraps on wine
bottles. Many wine producers in the United States and Europe
have already stopped using them.<br><br>

     FDA advises consumers to wipe the rim and top of the cork
of wine bottles sealed with foil with a cloth dampened with
water or lemon juice before removing the cork. Pregnant and
lactating women have long been advised to avoid alcoholic
beverages, including wine. <B>Lead contamination is another good
reason for pregnant women to refrain from drinking wine.</B><br><br>

     Even at low levels, lead not excreted through the
digestive system accumulates in the body and is absorbed
directly into blood and soft tissues, including the kidney,
bone marrow, liver, and brain. When lead leaves the
bloodstream, it is stored in bone, along with other minerals,
where it continues to build over a lifetime.<br><br>

     In average adults, 10 to 15 percent of lead that reaches
the digestive tract is absorbed. <B>Young children and pregnant
women</B>, however, <B>absorb as much as 50 percent</B>. The body cannot
distinguish between calcium and lead. Once lead enters the
body, it is assimilated in the bloodstream in the same manner
as calcium, and, because young children and pregnant women
absorb calcium more readily to meet their extra needs, they
also absorb more lead. Those with calcium deficiencies absorb
even more. And lead, even in small amounts, may become toxic
wherever it settles. (See "Getting the Lead Out of Just About
Everything," FDA Consumer, August 1991.)<br><br>

     Lead also gets into the blood of pregnant women from their
own bone stores. During a period of physiological stress, such
as in pregnancy or lactation, bone-stores of minerals,
including the normally inert lead, can be mobilized back into a
woman's blood and increase her blood-lead level. As this blood
circulates, it is picked up by the fetus.<br><br>

     FDA considers children and pregnant women at highest risk
for lead poisoning. FDA toxicologists say that for pregnant
women, lead exposure is an actual, rather than potential,
problem. Besides potentially harming her own health, lead can
damage the developing fetus because it crosses the placental
barrier.<br><br>

     A 1987 report in the New England Journal of Medicine shows
that as little as 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of fetal
blood could damage a fetus early in pregnancy during its most
vulnerable period of nervous system development. It can also
cause premature birth or lower birth weight. In adults, 30
micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood can cause high blood
pressure and damage nerves and red blood cells.<br><br>

     FDA toxicologists have set provisional total tolerable
retake levels (PTTILs) of lead from all sources at 25
micrograms per day for pregnant women, and 6 micrograms per day
for infants and children up to 6 years. For every microgram per
day of lead intake, blood lead levels increase 0.16 micrograms
per deciliter of blood in children and 0.04 micrograms per
deciliter of blood in adults.<br><br>

    PTTILs represent the intake level FDA believes provides a
reasonable margin of protection from the measurable toxic
effects of lead from all food and nonfood sources. Scientists
have not found a no-effect level of toxicity from lead. If
additional research shows that lower blood-lead levels cause
measurable adverse health effects, the PTTILs would be reduced
even further.<br><br>

<H3><a name="Crystal Ware">Crystal Ware</a></H3>

     Recent studies have found that lead can leach into food
from lead crystal hollowware. The International Crystal
Federation has provided FDA a report of its research on lead
leaching into food and alcoholic beverages, and the industry
has started a program in which manufacturers share
technological developments to reduce lead leaching. Also, FDA
has initiated studies of its own on lead leaching from crystal.<br><br>

     Until FDA reviews all the data and determines what further
actions, if any, need to be taken, the agency advises consumers
not to store alcoholic beverages in lead crystal decanters, and
pregnant women not to routinely drink from lead crystal
glasses. Infants should not be fed with lead crystal baby
bottles.<br><br>

     Because lead is ubiquitous, FDA recognizes that no effort
will totally eliminate lead from the food supply, however
desirable that may be. But FDA and many other federal, state
and local governments are working together through all
available means to reduce exposure to lead. The initial focus
is on the sources likely to result in the greatest exposure.<br><br>

     FDA uses as many sources as it can to get the story of
lead to consumers, both of the harm it causes, and about how to
prevent poisoning. Careful attention to consumer advisories can
prevent unnecessary exposure to this age-old health problem.<br><br>

<h2>Early Identification of Speech-Language Delays and Disorders</h2>
<h3>From: Let's Talk...  No. 32 <br><br>Courtesy of <br>
<a href="/ASHA/index.html">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a> </h3>
</center>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Why is speech-language treatment needed? My baby doesn't talk yet!<br><br>

<li>That's just "baby-talk". I'm sure my child will outgrow it.<br><br>

<li>Everyone in our family was a late talker.  My child will talk when the time is right.<br><br>

<li>Why worry now? Speech and language services will be available when school starts.<br><br>

<li>Treatment? Looks like they are just playing games to me.
</ul>

<p>You may have had similar thoughts or comments. Usually, there is concern 
about a child's speech and language skills if there is no speech by the age of 1 
year, if speech is not clear, or if speech or language is different from that of 
other children of the same age.</p>

<H3>What is Early Identification?</H3> 

<p>It is estimated that 2% of all children born each year will have a disabling condition. Many of these children will have  speech and or language delays and disorders that may have a significant effect  on personal,  social,  academic, or vocational life. Although some children will  develop normal speech and language skills without treatment by the time  they enter school,  it is important to identify those who will not.
</p>

<p>Many people falsely believe that speech-language treatment cannot and 
should not begin until a child begins to talk. Yet research has shown that 
children know a great deal about their language even before the first word is said.  For example, children can distinguish between 
their native language and a foreign language, use different nonverbal 
utterances to express different needs, and imitate different patterns of speech  through babbling. </p>

<p>Early identification includes the evaluation and treatment provided to 
families and their children under  3 years old who have, or are at risk for 
having, a disability, or delay in speech, language or hearing. A child can 
quickly fall behind if speech and language learning is delayed. Early 
identification increases the chances  for improving communication skills.</p>

<H3>Who Should be Evaluated?</H3>

<p>Children identified as at-risk or high-risk, such as those from neonatal 
intensive care (NICU) units, should be tested early and at regular intervals. 
Other risk factors include diagnosed medical conditions, for example, chronic 
ear infections; biological factors, for example. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; genetic  defects, for example Down syndrome:   neurological defects, for example. cerebral palsy; or developmental disorders, for example, delayed language.</p>

<p>Children with no high-risk features should be evaluated if their speech and 
language is not similar to other children of the same age.</p>

<H3>How is the Evaluation Done?</H3>

<p>Evaluation may be formal or informal and include any combination of standardized tests; direct observation of play and interaction with caregivers; report by parent, 
teacher, or physician; and collection and detailed analysis of spontaneous 
speech samples.</p>

<p>Several sessions as well as ongoing evaluation may be required to obtain 
enough information to make an accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p>The early identification team may consist of the speech-language pathologist, 
audiologist, psychologist, neurologist, 
electrophysiologist, otolaryngologist,  pediatrician, nurse, and social
worker. Because speech-language delays and disorders may be due to a variety 
of causes, each professional makes valuable contributions to the evaluation.</p>

<H3>What is Speech-Language Treatment?</H3>

<p>From the results of the evaluation, certain services may be recommended. Prevention includes those  children who have been identified as at-risk, for example, due to low  birthweight, for a communication delay or disorder.</p>

<p>Services are provided 
before a specific diagnosis has been made. Remediation increases function in 
areas identified as delayed or disabling and may serve to prevent other related 
problems. For example, remediation of a language disorder can help to offset 
learning difficulties. Compensation enables the child and the family to make 
adjustments for limitations, as in some cases of cerebral palsy.</p>

<p>Language is taught in a natural
setting. It is presented at the child's developmental level; responses are 
consistently stimulated; and output is rewarded. Play may be used to teach 
communication, language models or rules of conversation, such as turn 
taking.</p>

<p>Feeding and swallowing
treatment may be needed to sustain life. It can also be used to encourage 
speech-like movements, stimulate sound production, or increase the child's 
awareness of speech movements.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about a possible speech-language delay or disability, 
consult a speech-language pathologist. <STRONG>A list of certified speech-language 
pathologists in your area may be obtained by calling the American Speech-
Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA) toll-free HELPLINE at 1-800-638-
8255.</STRONG></p>

<h2>Questions and Answers about Stuttering</h2>
<h3>Courtesy of <br>
<a href="/ASHA/index.html">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a> </h3>
</center>

<H3>What is stuttering?</H3>

<ul><li>Stuttering is the condition in which the flow of speech is broken by abnormal stoppages (no sound), repetitions (st-st-stuttering), or prolongations (ssssstuttering) of sounds and syllables. There may also be unusual facial and body movements associated with the effort to speak.
</ul>


<H3>Aren't all people nonfluent to some extent?</H3>

<ul><li>Yes. Almost all children go through a stage of frequent nonfluency in early      speech development. Adults may interject syllables ("uh") and occasionally      repeat words, phrases and sounds,      but these nonfluencies are accepted as      normal and usually are not a cause for      concern.
</ul>
<H3>Does stammering mean the same thing  as stuttering?</H3>

<ul><li>Most people use the terms
     interchangeably.
</ul>

<H3>What causes stuttering?</H3>

<ul><li>We still do not know for a fact what      causes stuttering. It may have different      causes in different people, or it may occur only when a combination of factors      comes together. It is also quite possible      that what causes stuttering is quite different from what makes it continue or      get worse. Possible influences include      incoordination of the speech muscles;      rate of language development; the way      parents and others talk to the child; and      other forms of communication and life      stress.
</ul>

<H3>Is stuttering caused by emotional or  psychological problems?</H3>

<ul><li>Children who stutter are no more likely      to have psychological problems than      children who do not stutter. In general,      there is no reason to believe that emotional trauma causes stuttering.
</ul>


<H3>At what age is stuttering likely to appear?</H3>

<ul><li>Stuttering typically begins at a very early age (usually between 2 and 5 years),      but will occasionally appear for the first      time in a school-age child and, more      rarely, in an adult.
</ul>

<H3>If I think my child is beginning to stutter, should I wait or seek help?</H3>

<ul><li>You should seek a professional evaluation as soon as you become concerned.      Most children outgrow their nonfluency,      but others will not. The problem of stuttering may be prevented from developing if treated early enough.
</ul>

<H3>Once stuttering has developed, can it be treated?</H3>

<ul><li>Yes, there are a variety of successful approaches for treating both children and      adults. There are no published scientific      data that indicate the general superiority of any one of these approaches.
</ul>

<H3>Can stuttering be "cured"?</H3>

<ul><li>It is best to avoid thinking in terms of an absolute "cure" for stuttering. Stuttering is not a disease. The goal should be to progress toward improved fluency  and success in communicating.
</ul>

<H3>What should I do when I hear a child speaking nonfluently?</H3>	


<ul><li>Children may be unaware that they are 	speaking nonfluently. Do not call attention to the nonfluent speech pattern. <br><br> 	

<li>Do not say "Stop and start over," 		"Think before you talk," "Talk slower," 		or "Cat got your tongue?" Listen patiently and carefully to what the child is 		saying, and do not focus on how it is 		being said.  	
</ul>

<H3>What should I do when I hear an adult stuttering?</H3>  	

<ul><li>Adults who stutter need the same patience and attention to their ideas as 		speakers who don't stutter. Don't look 		away and don't hurry them or fill in 		words. This attempt to help can create 		anxiety and self-consciousness and 		make the problem worse.  
</ul>

<H3>Who can help with this problem?</H3>  

<ul><li>A speech-language pathologist who has had experience in dealing with the stuttering problems of children and adults. The speech-language pathologist is the professional who is trained at the master's or doctoral degree level to evaluate the person who stutters and prepare a plan to improve speech.<br><br>

<li>Speech-language pathologists hold the Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) from the American Speech- Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and/or a license from your state.
</ul>

<h2>Questions and Answers about Articulation Problems</h2>
<h3>Courtesy of <br>
<a href="/ASHA/index.html">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a> </h3>
</center>

<H3>What is articulation?</H3> 	

<ul><li>Articulation is the process by which sounds, syllables, 	and words are formed when your tongue, jaw, teeth, lips, and  palate alter the air stream coming from the 	vocal folds.
</ul>  

<H3>What is an  articulation problem?</H3>
 
<ul><li>A person has an articulation problem when 
he or she produces sounds, syllables. or words incorrectly so that listeners 
do not understand what is being said or pay more attention to the way 
the words sound than to what they mean. 
</ul>

<H3>Is an articulation problem 
the same as "baby talk"?</H3> 

<ul><li>An articulation problem sometimes sounds 
like baby 	talk because many very young children do 	mispronounce 
sounds, syllables, and words. But words that sound cute when 
mispronounced by  young children interfere with the communication 
of 	older children or adults. Older children and adults 	have so many 
severe errors that their articulation 	problems are very different from "baby 
talk."
</ul>

<H3>What are some types of sound errors?</H3>

<ul><li>Most errors fall into one of three categories-
     omissions, substitutions, or distortions. An example   of an omission is 
"at" for "hat" or "oo" for "shoe."      An example of a substitution is the use of 
"w" for      "r." which makes "rabbit" sound like "wabbit," or      the 
substitution of "th" for "s" so that "sun" is      pronounced "thun." When the 
sound is said      inaccurately, but sounds something like the intended      
sound, it is called a distortion.
</ul>

<H3>What causes an articulation problem?</H3>

<ul><li>Articulation problems may result from physical      handicaps, such as 
cerebral palsy, cleft palate. or      hearing loss, or may be related to other 
problems in      the mouth, such as dental problems. However, most      
articulation problems occur in the absence of any   obvious physical 
disability. The cause of these so-called functional articulation problems may be faulty      learning of speech 
sounds.
</ul>

<H3>Is an accent an articulation problem?</H3>

<ul><li>It can be for some persons. We all have accents-
Southern, Eastern, Northern, Western, Chicago,
Pittsburgh, Brooklyn, or Boston. An accent may be a problem if it interferes with a person's goals in life.
</ul>

<H3>Can ear problems during infancy have any effect on
     late sound development?</H3>

<ul><li>Children learn their speech sounds by listening to the      speech around  them. This learning begins very early      in life. If children have frequent ear  problems during   this important listening period. they may fail to learn      some speech sounds.
</ul>

<H3>Will a child outgrow a functional articulation problem?</H3>

<ul><li>A child's overall speech pattern will usually become    more understandable as he or she matures. but   some children will need direct 
training to eliminate all   articulation errors. The exact speech pattern of the      
individual child will determine the answer to this      question.
</ul>

<H3>Do children learn all sounds at once?</H3>

<ul><li>Sounds are learned in an orderly sequence. Some sounds, such as "p," 
"m," and "b," are learned as early as 3 years of age. Other sounds, like "s," 
"r,' and "l," often are not completely mastered until the early school years.
<br><br>
<li>At what age should a child be producing all sounds correctly?
Children should make all the sounds of English by 8   years of age. Many 
children learn these sounds much   earlier.
</ul>

<H3>How can I help a child pronounce words correctly?</H3>

<ul><li>By setting a good example. Don't interrupt or      constantly correct the 
child. Don't let anyone tease      or mock (including friends or relatives). 
Instead,  present a good model. Use the misarticulated word      correctly 
with emphasis. If the child says, "That's a      big wabbit," you say "Yes, that is a 
big rabbit. A big  white rabbit. Would you like to have a rabbit?"
</ul>

<H3>Can an adult with an articulation problem be helped?</H3>

<ul><li>As most articulation problems can be helped regardless of a person's age, but 
the longer the problem persists, the harder it is to change. Some problems.
such as those relating to nerve impulses to the muscles of articulation (dysarthria), are particularly difficult and generally will require a longer period of help than a functional disorder. Other conditions that may influence progress in a child or adult include hearing ability, condition of the oral structures such as the teeth, frequency of help obtained, motivation, intelligence, and cooperation.
</ul>

<H3>Who can help?</H3>

<ul><li>Contact a speech-language pathologist if you are      concerned about speech. A speech-language   pathologist is a professional trained at the master's or      doctoral level to evaluate and help the child or adult   with an articulation problem as well as other speech  and/or language disorders. The speech-language      pathologist should be certified by the American      Speech-Language-Hearing Association and/or      licensed by your state. The speech-language      pathologist can advise whether professional help is      indicated and how to arrange for assistance. The      speech-language pathologist can also give you      guidance or provide services to help prevent or      eliminate a problem. Early help is especially  important for more severe problems.
</ul>

<H3>Is it important to correct an articulation problem?</H3>

<ul><li>When you consider the possible impact an   articulation problem may have on one's social,   emotional, educational, and/or vocational status, the      answer becomes obvious. Our speech is an   important part of us. The quality of our lives is    affected by the adequacy of our speech.
</ul>

<h4>Message from the National Institute of Mental Health</h4><p>
<p>
<p>
     Research conducted and supported by the National Institute
of Mental Health brings hope to millions of people who suffer
from mental illness and to their families and friends. In many
years of work with animals as well as human subjects,
researchers have advanced our understanding of the brain and
vastly expanded the capability of mental health professionals
to diagnose, treat, and prevent mental and brain disorders.<p>
<p>
     Now, in the 1990s, which the President and Congress have
declared the "Decade of the Brain," we stand at the threshold
of a new era in brain and behavioral sciences. Through
research, we will learn even more about mental and brain
disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and learning
disabilities. And we will be able to use this knowledge to
develop new therapies that can help more people overcome mental
illness.<p>
<p>
     The National Institute of Mental Health is part of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Federal Government's
primary agency for biomedical and behavioral research. NIH is a
component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction to Learning Disablilities</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     Imagine having important needs and ideas to communicate,
but being unable to express them. Perhaps feeling bombarded by
sights and sounds, unable to focus your attention. Or trying to
read or add but not being able to make sense of the letters or
numbers.<p>
<p>
     You may not need to imagine. You may be the parent or
teacher of a child experiencing academic problems, or have
someone in your family diagnosed as learning disabled. Or
possibly as a child you were told you had a reading problem
called dyslexia or some other learning handicap.<p>
<p>
     Although different from person to person, these
difficulties make up the common daily experiences of many
learning disabled children, adolescents, and adults. A person
with a learning disability may experience a cycle of academic
failure and lowered serf-esteem. Having these handicaps--or
living with someone who has them--can bring overwhelming
frustration.<p>
<p>
     But the prospects are hopeful. It is important to remember
that a person with a learning disability can learn. The
disability usually only affects certain limited areas of a
child's development. In fact, rarely are learning disabilities
severe enough to impair a person's potential to live a happy,
normal life.<p>
<p>
     This booklet is provided by the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH), the Federal agency that supports research
nationwide on the brain, mental illnesses, and mental health.
Scientists supported by NIMH are dedicated to understanding the
workings and interrelationships of the various regions of the
brain, and to finding preventions and treatments to overcome
brain dysfunctions that handicap people in school, work, and
play.<p>
<p>
     The booklet provides up-to-date information on learning
disabilities and the role of NIMH-sponsored research in
discovering underlying causes and effective treatments. It
describes treatment options, strategies for coping, and sources
of information and support. Among these sources are doctors,
special education teachers, and mental health professionals who
can help identify learning disabilities and recommend the right
combination of medical, psychosocial, and educational
treatment.<p>
<p>
     In this booklet, you'll also read the stories of Susan,
Wallace, and Dennis, three people who have learning
disabilities. Although each had a rough start, with help they
learned to cope with their handicaps. You'll see their early
frustrations, their steps toward getting help, and their hopes
for the future.<p>
<p>
     The stories of Susan, Wallace, and Dennis are
representative of people with learning disabilities, but the
characters are not real. Of course, people with learning
disabilities are not all alike, so these stories may not fit
any particular individual.<p>

<h2><a name="Understand">Understanding the Problem</a></h2>
<p>
<p>
Susan<p>

<p>
     At age 14, Susan still tends to be quiet. Ever since she
was a child, she was so withdrawn that people sometimes forgot
she was there. She seemed to drift into a world of her own.
When she did talk, she often called objects by the wrong names.
She had few friends and mostly played with dolls or her little
sister. In school, Susan hated reading and math because none of
the letters, numbers or "+" and "-" signs made any sense. She
felt awful about herself. She'd been told--and was
convinced--that she was retarded.<p>
<p>
<p>
Wallace<p>
<p>
     Wallace has lived 46 years, and still has trouble
understanding what people say. Even as a boy, many words
sounded alike. His father patiently said things over and over.
But whenever his mother was drunk, she flew into a rage and
spanked him for not listening. Wallace's speech also came out
funny. He had such problems saying words that in school his
teacher sometimes couldn't understand him. When classmates
called him a "dummy," his fists just seemed to take over.
<p>
<p>
Dennis<p>

<p>
     Dennis is 23 years old and still seems to have too much
energy. But he had always been an overactive boy, sometimes
jumping on the sofa for hours until he collapsed with
exhaustion. In grade school, he never sat still. He interrupted
lessons. But he was a friendly, well-meaning kid, so adults
didn't get too angry. His academic problems became evident in
third grade, when his teacher realized that Dennis could only
recognize a few words and wrote like a first grader. She
recommended that Dennis repeat third grade, to give him time to
"catch up." After another full year, his behavior was still out
of control, and his reading and writing had not improved.<p>

<h3><a name="What is">What is a learning disability?</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     Unlike other disabilities, such as paralysis or blindness,
a learning disability (LD) is a hidden handicap. A learning
disability doesn't disfigure or leave visible signs that would
invite others to be understanding or offer support. A woman
once blurted to Wallace, "You seem so intelligent--you don't
look handicapped!"<p>
<p>
     LD is a disorder that affects people's ability to either
interpret what they see and hear or to link information from
different parts of the brain. These limitations can show up in
many ways--as specific difficulties with spoken and written
language, coordination, self-control, or attention. Such
difficulties extend to schoolwork and can impede learning to
read or write, or to do math.<p>
<p>
     Learning disabilities can be lifelong conditions that, in
some cases, affect many parts of a person's life: school or
work, daily routines, family life, and sometimes even
friendships and play. In some people, many overlapping learning
disabilities may be apparent. Other people may have a single,
isolated learning problem that has little impact on other areas
of their lives.<p>

<h3><a name="What are">What are the types of learning disabilities?</a></h3><p>
<p>
<p>
     "Learning disability" is not a diagnosis in the same sense
as "chickenpox" or "mumps." Chickenpox and mumps imply a
single, known cause with a predictable set of symptoms. Rather,
LD is a broad term that covers a pool of possible causes,
symptoms, treatments, and outcomes. Partly because learning
disabilities can show up in so many forms, it is difficult to
diagnose or to pinpoint the causes. And no one knows of a pill
or remedy that will cure them.<p>
<p>
     Not all learning problems are necessarily learning
disabilities. Many children are simply slower in developing
certain skills. Because children show natural differences in
their rate of development, sometimes what seems to be a
learning disability may simply be a delay in maturation. To be
diagnosed as a learning disability, specific criteria must be
met.<p>
<p>
     The criteria and characteristics for diagnosing learning
disabilities appear in a reference book called the DSM (short
for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).
The DSM diagnosis is commonly used when applying for health
insurance coverage of diagnostic and treatment services.
<p>
     Learning disabilities can be divided into three broad
categories:<p>
<ul>
  <li>Developmental speech and language disorders

  <li>Academic skills disorders
 
   <li>"Other," a catch-all that includes certain coordination
     disorders and learning handicaps not covered by the other
     terms<p>
</ul>
<p>
     Each of these categories includes a number of more
specific disorders.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Because children do show natural differences in their rate
of development, not all learning problems are learning
disabilities.<p>

<p><h3><a name="Developmental Speech and Language Disorders">Developmental Speech and Language Disorders</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
     Speech and language problems are often the earliest
indicators of a learning disability. People with developmental
speech and language disorders have difficulty producing speech
sounds, using spoken language to communicate, or understanding
what other people say. Depending on the problem, the specific
diagnosis may be:<p>
<ul>
   <li> Developmental articulation disorder

   <li> Developmental expressive language disorder

   <li> Developmental receptive language disorder
</ul>
     Developmental articulation disorder. Children with this
disorder may have trouble controlling their rate of speech. Or
they may lag behind playmates in learning to make speech
sounds. For example, Wallace at age 6 still said "wabbit"
instead of "rabbit" and "thwim" for "swim." Developmental
articulation disorders are common. They appear in at least 10
percent of children younger than age 8. Fortunately,
articulation disorders can often be outgrown or successfully
treated with speech therapy.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Some people have trouble understanding certain aspects of
speech.<p>

<p>
     Developmental expressive language disorder. Some children
with language impairments have problems expressing themselves
in speech. Their disorder is called, therefore, a developmental
expressive language disorder. Susan, who often calls objects by
the wrong names, has an expressive language disorder. Of
course, an expressive language disorder can take other forms. A
4-year-old who speaks only in two-word phrases and a 6-year-old
who can't answer simple questions also have an expressive
language disability.<p>
<p>
     Developmental receptive language disorder. Some people
have trouble understanding certain aspects of speech.  It's as
if their brains are set to a different frequency and the
reception is poor. There's the toddler who doesn't respond to
his name, a preschooler who hands you a bell when you asked for
a ball, or the worker who consistently can't follow simple
directions. Their hearing is fine, but they can't make sense of
certain sounds, words, or sentences they hear. They may even
seem inattentive. These people have a receptive language
disorder. Because using and understanding speech are strongly
related, many people with receptive language disorders also
have an expressive language disability.<p>
<p>
     Of course, in preschoolers, some misuse of sounds, words,
or grammar is a normal part of learning to speak. It's only
when these problems persist that there is any cause for
concern.<p>

<p><h3><a name="Academic Skills Disorders">Academic Skills Disorders</a></h3>
<p>
     Students with academic skills disorders are often years
behind their classmates in developing reading, writing, or
arithmetic skills. The diagnoses in this category include:
<ul>
   <li> Developmental reading disorder

   <li> Developmental writing disorder

   <li> Developmental arithmetic disorder<p>
</ul>
<p>
     <STRONG>Developmental reading disorder.</STRONG> This type of disorder,
also known as dyslexia, is quite widespread. In fact, reading
disabilities affect 2 to 8 percent of elementary school
children.<p>
<p>
     When you think of what is involved in the "three
R's"--reading, 'riting, and 'rithmetic--it's astounding that
most of us do learn them. Consider that to read, you must
simultaneously:<p>
<ul>
   <li> Focus attention on the printed marks and control eye
     movements across the page

   <li> Recognize the sounds associated with letters

   <li> Understand words and grammar

   <li> Build ideas and images

   <li> Compare new ideas to what you already know

   <li> Store ideas in memory
</ul>
<p>
     Such mental juggling requires a rich, intact network of
nerve cells that connect the brain's centers of vision,
language, and memory.<p>
<p>
     A person can have problems in any of the tasks involved in
reading. However, scientists found that a significant number of
people with dyslexia share an inability to distinguish or
separate the sounds in spoken words. Dennis, for example, can't
identify the word "bat" by sounding out the individual letters,
b-a-t. Other children with dyslexia may have trouble with
rhyming games, such as rhyming "cat" with "bat." Yet scientists
have found these skills fundamental to learning to read.
Fortunately, remedial reading specialists have developed
techniques that can help many children with dyslexia acquire
these skills.<p>
<p>
     However, there is more to reading than recognizing. words.
If the brain is unable to form images or relate new ideas to
those stored in memory, the reader can't understand or remember
the new concepts. So other types of reading disabilities can
appear in the upper grades when the focus of reading shifts
from word identification to comprehension.<p>
<p>
     Children with dyslexia may have trouble with rhyming
games, such as rhyming "cat" with "bat."<p>
<p>
<p>
     <STRONG>Developmental writing disorder.</STRONG> Writing, too, involves
several brain areas and functions. The brain networks for
vocabulary, grammar, hand movement, and memory must all be in
good working order. So a developmental writing disorder may
result from problems in any of these areas. For example,
Dennis, who was unable to distinguish the sequence of sounds in
a word, had problems with spelling. A child with a writing
disability, particularly an expressive language disorder, might
be unable to compose complete, grammatical sentences.<p>

<p>
     Because developmental skills build on each other, a person
may have more than one learning disability.<p>
<p>
<p>
    <STRONG> Developmental arithmetic disorder.</STRONG> If you doubt that
arithmetic is a complex process, think of the steps you take to
solve this simple problem:  
<p>
[Graphic Omitted]<p>
<p>
     Arithmetic involves recognizing numbers and symbols,
memorizing facts such as the multiplication table, aligning
numbers, and understanding abstract concepts like place value
and fractions. Any of these may be difficult for children with
developmental arithmetic disorders. Problems with numbers or
basic concepts are likely to show up early. Disabilities that
appear in the later grades are more often tied to problems in
reasoning.<p>
<p>
     Many aspects of speaking, listening, reading, writing, and
arithmetic overlap and build on the same brain capabilities. So
it's not surprising that people can be diagnosed as having more
than one area of learning disability. For example, the ability
to understand language underlies learning speak. Therefore, any
disorder that hinders the ability to understand language will
also interfere with the development of speech, which in turn
hinders learning to read and write. A single gap in the brain's
operation can disrupt many types of activity.<p>
<p>
<p>
"Other" learning disabilities<p>
<p>
<p>
     The DSM also lists additional categories, such as "motor
skills disorders" and "specific developmental disorders not
otherwise specified." These diagnoses include delays in
acquiring language, academic, and motor skills that can affect
the ability to learn, but do not meet the criteria for
a specific learning disability. Also included are coordination
disorders that can lead to poor penmanship, as well as certain
spelling and memory disorders.<p>

<p><h3><a name="LD With Attention Disorders">Attention Disorders</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
     Nearly 4 million school-age children have learning
disabilities. Of these, at least 20 percent have a type of
disorder that leaves them unable to focus their attention.
<p>
     Some children and adults who have attention disorders
appear to daydream excessively. And once you get their
attention, they're often easily distracted. Susan, for example,
tends to mentally drift off into a world of her own. Children
like Susan may have a number of learning difficulties. If, like
Susan, they are quiet and don't cause problems, their problems
may go unnoticed. They may be passed along from grade to grade,
without getting the special assistance they need.<p>
<p>
     In a large proportion of affected children--mostly
boys--the attention deficit is accompanied by hyperactivity.
Dennis is an example of a person with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder-ADHD. Like young Dennis, who jumped on
the sofa to exhaustion, hyperactive children can't sit still.
They act impulsively, running into traffic or toppling desks.
They blurt out answers and interrupt. In games, they can't wait
their turn. These children's problems are usually hard to miss.
Because of their constant motion and explosive energy,
hyperactive children often get into trouble with parents,
teachers, and peers.<p>
<p>
     By adolescence, physical hyperactivity usually subsides
into fidgeting and restlessness. But the problems with
attention and concentration often continue into adulthood. At
work, adults with ADHD often have trouble organizing tasks or
completing their work. They don't seem to listen to or follow
directions. Their work may be messy and appear careless.
<p>
     Like young Dennis, who jumped on the sofa to exhaustion,
hyperactive children can't sit still.<p>
<p>
     Attention disorders, with or without hyperactivity, are
not considered learning disabilities in themselves. However,
because attention problems can seriously interfere with school
performance, they often accompany academic skills disorders.<p>

<h3><a name="What causes">What causes learning disabilities?</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     Understandably, one of the first questions parents ask
when they learn their child has a learning disorder is "Why?
What went wrong?"<p>
<p>
     Mental health professionals stress that since no one knows
what causes learning disabilities, it doesn't help parents to
look backward to search for possible reasons. There are too
many possibilities to pin down the cause of the disability with
certainty. It is far more important for the family to move
forward in finding ways to get the fight help.<p>
<p>
     Scientists, however, do need to study causes in an effort
to identify ways to prevent learning disabilities.<p>
<p>
     Once, scientists thought that all learning disabilities
were caused by a single neurological problem. But research
supported by NIMH has helped us see that the causes are more
diverse and complex. New evidence seems to show that most
learning disabilities do not stem from a single, specific area
of the brain, but from difficulties in bringing together
information from various brain regions.<p>
<p>
     Today, a leading theory is that learning disabilities stem
from subtle disturbances in brain structures and functions.
Some scientists believe that, in many cases, the disturbance
begins before birth.<p>
<p>
<H4>Errors in fetal brain development</H4><p>
<p>
<p>
     Throughout pregnancy, the fetal brain develops from a few
all-purpose cells into a complex organ made of billions of
specialized, interconnected nerve cells called neurons. During
this amazing evolution, things can go wrong that may alter how
the neurons form or interconnect.<p>
<p>
     In the early stages of pregnancy, the brain stem forms. It
controls basic life functions such as breathing and digestion.
Later, a deep ridge divides the cerebrum--the thinking part of
the brain-into two halves, a right and left hemisphere.
Finally, the areas involved with processing sight, sound, and
other senses develop, as well as the areas associated with
attention, thinking, and emotion.<p>
<p>
     As new cells form, they move into place to create various
brain structures. Nerve cells rapidly grow to form networks
with other parts of the brain. These networks are what allow
information to be shared among various regions of the brain.<p>
<p>
     Throughout pregnancy, this brain development is vulnerable
to disruptions. If the disruption occurs early, the fetus may
die, or the infant may be born with widespread disabilities and
possibly mental retardation. If the disruption occurs later,
when the cells are becoming specialized and moving into place,
it may leave errors in the cell makeup, location, or
connections. Some scientists believe that these errors may
later show up as learning disorders.<p>

<p>
     By birth, all the basic structures of the brain are
present.</p>


<H4>Other factors that affect brain development</H4><p>


     Through experiments with animals, scientists at NIMH and
other research facilities are tracking clues to determine what
disrupts brain development. By studying the normal processes of
brain development, scientists can better understand what can go
wrong. Some of these studies are examining how genes, substance
abuse, pregnancy problems, and toxins may affect the developing
brain.<p>
<p>
    <H4><I>Genetic factors.</I></H4> The fact that learning disabilities tend
to run in families indicates that there may be a genetic link.
For example, children who lack some of the skills needed for
reading, such as hearing the separate sounds of words, are
likely to have a parent with a related problem. However, a
parent's learning disability may take a slightly different form
in the child. A parent who has a writing disorder may have a
child with an expressive language disorder. For this reason, it
seems unlikely that specific learning disorders are inherited
directly. Possibly, what is inherited is a subtle brain
dysfunction that can in turn lead to a learning disability.<p>
<p>
     There may be an alternative explanation for why LD might
seem to run in families. Some learning difficulties may
actually stem from the family environment. For example, parents
who have expressive language disorders might talk less to their
children, or the language they use may be distorted. In such
cases, the child lacks a good model for acquiring language and
therefore, may seem to be learning disabled.<p>
<p>
<p>
     It seems unlikely that specific learning disorders are
inherited directly.<p>
<p>
<p>
     <H4><I>Tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use.</I></H4> Many drugs taken by
the mother pass directly to the fetus. Research shows that a
mother's use of cigarettes, alcohol, or other drugs during
pregnancy may have damaging effects on the unborn child.
Therefore, to prevent potential harm to developing babies, the
U.S. Public Health Service supports efforts to make people
aware of the possible dangers of smoking, drinking, and using
drugs.<p>
<p>
     Scientists have found that mothers who smoke during
pregnancy may be more likely to bear smaller babies. This is a
concern because small newborns, usually those weighing less
than 5 pounds, tend to be at risk for a variety of problems,
including learning disorders.<p>
<p>
     Alcohol also may be dangerous to the fetus' developing
brain. It appears that alcohol may distort the developing
neurons. Heavy alcohol use during pregnancy has been linked to
fetal alcohol syndrome, a condition that can lead to low birth
weight, intellectual impairment, hyperactivity, and certain
physical defects. Any alcohol use during pregnancy, however,
may influence the child's development and lead to problems with
learning, attention, memory, or problem solving. Because
scientists have not yet identified "safe" levels, alcohol
should be used cautiously by women who are pregnant or who may
soon become pregnant.<p>
<p>
     Drugs such as cocaine--especially in its smokable form
known as crack--seem to affect the normal development of brain
receptors. These brain cell parts help to transmit incoming
signals from our skin, eyes, and ears, and help regulate our
physical response to the environment. Because children with
certain learning disabilities have difficulty understanding
speech sounds or letters, some researchers believe that
learning disabilities, as well as ADHD, may be related to
faulty receptors. Current research points to drug abuse as a
possible cause of receptor damage.<p>
<p>
     <H4><I>Problems during pregnancy or delivery.</I></H4> Other possible
causes of learning disabilities involve complications during
pregnancy. In some cases, the mother's immune system reacts to
the fertus and attacks it as if it were an infection. This type
of disruption seems to cause newly formed brain cells to settle
in the wrong part of the brain. Or during delivery, the
umbilical cord may become twisted and temporarily cut off
oxygen to the fetus. This, too, can impair brain functions and
lead to LD.<p>
<p>
<p>
     By studying the normal processes of brain development,
scientists can better understand what can go wrong.
<p>
<p>
     <H4><I>Toxins in the child's environment.</I></H4>
New brain cells and
neural networks continue to be produced for a year or so after
the child is born. These cells are vulnerable to certain
disruptions, also.<p>
<p>
     Researchers are looking into environmental toxins that may
lead to learning disabilities, possibly by disrupting childhood
brain development or brain processes. Cadmium and lead, both
prevalent in the environment, are becoming a leading focus of
neurological research. Cadmium, used in making some steel
products, can get into the soil, then into the foods we eat.
Lead was once common in paint and gasoline, and is still
present in some water pipes. A study of animals sponsored by
the National Institutes of Health showed a connection between
exposure to lead and learning difficulties. In the study, rats
exposed to lead experienced changes in their brainwaves,
slowing their ability to learn. The learning problems lasted
for weeks, long after the rats were no longer exposed to lead.<p>
<p>
     In addition, there is growing evidence that learning
problems may develop in children with cancer who had been
treated with chemotherapy or radiation at an early age. This
seems particularly true of children with brain tumors who
received radiation to the skull.<p>

<h3> <a name="Are learning">Are learning disabilities related to differences in the brain? </a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     In comparing people with and without learning
disabilities, scientists have observed certain differences in
the structure and functioning of the brain. For example, new
research indicates that there may be variations in the brain
structure called the planum temporale, a language-related area
found in both sides of the brain. In people with dyslexia, the
two structures were found to be equal in size. In people who
are not dyslexic, however, the left planum temporale was
noticeably larger. Some scientists believe reading problems may
be related to such differences.
<p>
     With more research, scientists hope to learn precisely how
differences in the structures and processes of the brain
contribute to learning disabilities, and how these differences
might be treated or prevented.<p>

<p>
<p>
Susan<p>
<p>
     Susan was promoted to the sixth grade but still couldn't
do basic math. So, her mother brought her to a private clinic
for testing. The clinician observed that Susan had trouble
associating symbols with their meaning, and this was holding
back her language, reading, and math development. Susan called
objects by the wrong words and she could not associate sounds
with letters or recognize math symbols. However, an IQ of 128
meant that Susan was quite bright. In addition to developing an
Individualized Education Plan, the clinician recommended that
Susan receive counseling for her low self-esteem and
depression.
<p>
<p>
Wallace<p>

<p>
     In the early 1960s, at the request of his ninth grade
teacher, Wallace was examined by a doctor to see why he didn't
speak or listen well. The doctor tested his vocal cords,
vision, and hearing. They were all fine. The teacher concluded
that Wallace must have "brain damage," so not much could be
done. Wallace kept failing in school and was suspended several
times for fighting. He finally dropped out after tenth grade.
He spent the next 25 years working as a janitor. Because LD
frequently went undiagnosed at the time when Wallace was young,
the needed help was not available to him.<p>
<p>
<p>
Dennis<p>
<p>
     In fifth grade, Dennis' teacher sent him to the school
psychologist for testing. Dennis was diagnosed as having
developmental reading and developmental writing disorders. He
was also identified as having an attention disorder with
hyperactivity. He was placed in an all-day special education
program, where he could work on his particular deficits and get
individual attention. His family doctor prescribed the
medication Ritalin to reduce his hyperactivity and
distractibility. Along with working to improve his reading, the
special education teacher helped him improve his listening
skills. Since his handwriting was still poor, he learned to
type homework and reports on a computer. At age 19, Dennis
graduated from high school and was accepted by a college that
gives special assistance to students with learning
disabilities.<BR><BR>

<p><h3> <a name="How are learning disabilities first">How are learning disabilities first identified?</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     The first step in solving any problem is realizing there
is one. Wallace, sadly, was a product of his time, when
learning disabilities were more of a mystery and often went
unrecognized. Today, professionals would know how to help
Wallace. Dennis and Susan were able to get help because someone
saw the problem and referred them for help.<p>
<p>
     When a baby is born, the parents eagerly wait for the
baby's first step, first word, a myriad of other "firsts."
During routine checkups, the pediatrician, too, watches for
more subtle signs of development. The parents and doctor are
watching for the child to achieve developmental milestones. The
developmental milestones chart  lists a few
of these markers and the ages and grades that they typically
appear.<p>
<p>
<p>
     The classroom teacher may be the first to notice a child's
persistent difficulties in reading, writing, or arithmetic.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Parents are usually the first to notice obvious delays in
their child reaching early milestones. The pediatrician may
observe more subtle signs of minor neurological damage, such as
a lack of coordination. But the classroom teacher, in fact, may
be the first to notice the child's persistent difficulties in
reading, writing, or arithmetic. As school tasks become more
complex, a child with a learning disability may have problems
mentally juggling more information.<p>
<p>
     The learning problems of children who are quiet and polite
in school may go unnoticed. Children with above average
intelligence, who manage to maintain passing grades despite
their disability, are even less likely to be identified.
Children with hyperactivity, on the other hand, will be
identified quickly by their impulsive behavior and excessive
movement. Hyperactivity usually begins before age 4 but may not
be recognized until the child enters school.<p>
<p>
     What should parents, doctors, and teachers do if critical
developmental milestones haven't appeared by the usual age?
Sometimes it's best to allow a little more time, simply for the
brain to mature a bit. But if a milestone is already long
delayed, if there's a history of learning disabilities in the
family, or if there are several delayed skills, the child
should be professionally evaluated as soon as possible. An
educator or a doctor who treats children can suggest where to
go for help.<p>

<p><h3> <a name="How are learning disabilities formally">How are learning disabilities formally diagnosed?</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     By law, learning disability is defined as a significant
gap between a person's intelligence and the skills the person
has achieved at each age. This means that a severely retarded
10-year-old who speaks like a 6-year-old probably doesn't have
a language or speech disability. He has mastered language up to
the limits of his intelligence. On the other hand, a fifth
grader with an IQ of 100 who can't write a simple sentence
probably does have LD.<p>
<p>
     Learning disorders may be informally flagged by observing
significant delays in the child's skill development. A 2-year
delay in the primary grades is usually considered significant.
For older students, such a delay is not as debilitating, so
learning disabilities aren't usually suspected unless there is
more than a 2-year delay. Actual diagnosis of learning
disabilities, however, is made using standardized tests that
compare the child's level of ability to what is considered
normal development for a person of that age and intelligence.
<p>
<p>
     Standardized tests compare the child's level of ability to
what is considered normal development for a person of that age
and intelligence.<p>
<p>
<p>
     For example, as late as fifth grade, Susan couldn't add
two numbers, even though she rarely missed school and was good
in other subjects. Her mother took her to a clinician, who
observed Susan's behavior and administered standardized math
and intelligence tests. The test results showed that Susan's
math skills were several years behind, given her mental
capacity for learning. Once other possible causes like lack of
motivation and vision problems were ruled out, Susan's math
problem was formally diagnosed as a specific learning
disability.<p>
<p>
     Test outcomes depend not only on the child's actual
abilities, but on the reliability of the test and the child's
ability to pay attention and understand the questions. Children
like Dennis, with poor attention or hyperactivity, may score
several points below their true level of ability. Testing a
child in an isolated room can sometimes help the child
concentrate and score higher.<p>
<p>
     Each type of LD is diagnosed in slightly different ways.
To diagnose speech and language disorders, a speech therapist
tests the child's pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar and
compares them to the developmental abilities seen in most
children that age. A psychologist tests the child's
intelligence. A physician checks for any ear infections, and an
audiologist may be consulted to rule out auditory problems. If
the problem involves articulation, a doctor examines the
child's vocal cords and throat.<p>
<p>
<p>
     In the case of academic skills disorders, academic
development in reading, writing, and math is evaluated using
standardized tests. In addition, vision and hearing are tested
to be sure the student can see words clearly and can hear
adequately. The specialist also checks if the child has missed
much school. It's important to rule out these other possible
factors. After all, treatment for a learning disability is very
different from the remedy for poor vision or missing school.
<p>
     ADHD is diagnosed by checking for the long-term presence
of specific behaviors, such as considerable fidgeting, losing
things, interrupting, and talking excessively. Other signs
include an inability to remain seated, stay on task, or take
turns. A diagnosis of ADHD is made only if the child shows such
behaviors substantially more than other children of the same
age.<p>
<p>
     If the school fails to notice a learning delay, parents
can request an outside evaluation. In Susan's case, her mother
chose to bring Susan to a clinic for testing. She then brought
documentation of the disability back to the school. After
confirming the diagnosis, the public school was obligated to 
provide the kind of instructional program that Susan needed.
<p>
<p>
     Some parents may find it helpful to ask someone they like
and trust to go with them to school meetings<p>
<p>
<p>
     Parents should stay abreast of each step of the school's
evaluation. Parents also need to know that they may appeal the
school's decision if they disagree with the findings of the
diagnostic team. And like Susan's mother, who brought Susan to
a clinic, parents always have the option of getting a second
opinion.<p>
<p>
     Some parents feel alone and confused when talking to
learning specialists. Such parents may find it helpful to ask
someone they like and trust to go with them to school meetings.
The person may be the child's clinician or caseworker, or even
a neighbor. It can help to have someone along who knows the
child and can help understand the child's test scores or
learning problems.<BR><BR>

<p><h3> <a name="What are the education">What are the education options?</a> </h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     Although obtaining a diagnosis is important, even more
important is creating a plan for getting the right help.
Because LD can affect the child and family in so many ways,
help may be needed on a variety of fronts: educational,
medical, emotional, and practical.<p>
<p>
     In most ways, children with learning disabilities are no
different from children without these disabilities. At school,
they eat together and share sports, games, and after-school
activities. But since children with learning disabilities do
have specific learning needs, most public schools provide
special programs.<p>
<p>
     Schools typically provide special education programs
either in a separate all-day classroom or as a special
education class that the student attends for several hours each
week. Some parents hire trained tutors to work with their child
after school. If the problems are severe, some parents choose
to place their child in a special school for the learning
disabled.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Sometimes parents hire trained tutors to work with their
child after school.<p>
<p>
<p>
     If parents choose to get help outside the public schools,
they should select a learning specialist carefully. The
specialist should be able to explain things in terms that the
parents can understand. Whenever possible, the specialist
should have professional certification and experience with the
learner's specific age group and type of disability. Some of
the support groups listed at the end of this booklet can
provide references to qualified special education programs.
<p>
     Planning a special education program begins with
systematically identifying what the student can and cannot do.
The specialist looks for patterns in the child's gaps. For
example, if the child fails to hear the separate sounds in
words, are there other sound discrimination problems? If
there's a problem with handwriting, are there other motor
delays? Are there any consistent problems with memory?
<p>
     Special education teachers also identify the types of
tasks the child can do and the senses that function well. By
using the senses that are intact and bypassing the
disabilities, many children can develop needed skills. These
strengths offer alternative ways the child can learn.
<p>
     After assessing the child's strengths and weaknesses, the
special education teacher designs an Individualized Educational
Program (IEP). The IEP outlines the specific skills the child
needs to develop as well as appropriate learning activities
that build on the child's strengths. Many effective learning
activities engage several skills and senses. For example, in
learning to spell and recognize words, a student may be asked
to see, say, write, and spell each new word. The student may
also write the words in sand, which engages the sense of touch.
Many experts believe that the more senses children use in
learning a skill, the more likely they are to retain it.<p>
<p>
<p>
     The student may also write the words in sand, which
engages the sense of touch.<p>
<p>
<p>
     An individualized, skill-based approach--like the approach
used by speech and language therapists--often succeeds in
helping where regular classroom instruction fails. Therapy for
speech and language disorders focuses on providing a
stimulating but structured environment for heating and
practicing language patterns. For example, the therapist may
help a child who has an articulation disorder to produce
specific speech sounds. During an engaging activity, the
therapist may talk about the toys, then encourage the child to
use the same sounds or words. In addition, the child may watch
the therapist make the sound, feel the vibration in the
therapist's throat, then practice making the sounds before a
mirror.<p>
<p>
     Researchers are also investigating nonstandard teaching
methods. Some create artificial learning conditions that may
help the brain receive information in nonstandard ways. For
example, in some language disorders, the brain seems abnormally
slow to process verbal information. Scientists are testing
whether computers that talk can help teach children to process
spoken sounds more quickly. The computer starts slowly,
pronouncing one sound at a time. As the child gets better at
recognizing the sounds and heating them as words, the sounds
are gradually speeded up to a normal rate of speech.<BR><BR>

<h3> <a name="Is medication">Is medication available?</a> </h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     For nearly six decades, many children with attention
disorders have benefited from being treated with medication.
Three drugs, Ritalin (methylphenidate), Dexedrine
(dextroamphetamine), and Cylert (pemoline), have been used
successfully. Although these drugs are stimulants in the same
category as "speed" and "diet pills," they seldom make children
"high" or more jittery. Rather, they temporarily improve
children's attention and ability to focus. They also help
children control their impulsiveness and other hyperactive
behaviors.<p>
<p>
     The effects of medication are most dramatic in children
with ADHD. Shortly after taking the medication, they become
more able to focus their attention. They become more ready to
learn. Studies by NIMH scientists and other researchers have
shown that at least 90 percent of hyperactive children can be
helped by either Ritalin or Dexedrine. If one medication does
not help a hyperactive child to calm down and pay attention in
school, the other medication might.<p>
<p>
     The drugs are effective for 3 to 4 hours and move out of
the body within 12 hours. The child's doctor or a psychiatrist
works closely with the family and child to carefully adjust the
dosage and medication schedule for the best effect. Typically,
the child takes the medication so that the drug is active
during peak school hours, such as when reading and math are
taught.<p>
<p>
     In the past few years, researchers have tested these drugs
on adults who have attention disorders. Just as in children,
the results show that low doses of these medications can help
reduce distractibility and impulsivity in adults. Use of these
medications has made it possible for many severely disordered
adults to organize their lives, hold jobs, and care for
themselves.<p>
<p>
     In trying to do everything possible to help their
children, many parents have been quick to try new treatments.
Most of these treatments sound scientific and reasonable, but a
few are pure quackery. Many are developed by reputable doctors
or specialists--but when tested scientifically, cannot be
proven to help. Following are types of therapy that have not
proven effective in treating the majority of children with
learning disabilities or attention disorders:<p>
<ul>
   <li> Megavitamins
<p>
   <li> Colored lenses
<p>
   <li> Special diets
<p>
   <li> Sugar-free diets
<p>
   <li> Body stimulation or manipulation
</ul><p>
     Although scientists hope that brain research will lead to
new medical interventions and drugs, at present there are no
medicines for speech, language, or academic disabilities.<p>

<p><h3> <a name="How do families learn">How do families learn to cope? </a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     The effects of learning disabilities can ripple outward
from the disabled child or adult to family, friends, and peers
at school or work.<p>
<p>
     Children with LD often absorb what others thoughtlessly
say about them. They may define themselves in light of their
disabilities, as "behind," "slow," or "different."<p>
<p>
     Sometimes they don't know how they're different, but they
know how awful they feel. Their tension or shame can lead them
to act out in various ways--from withdrawal to belligerence.
Like Wallace, they may get into fights. They may stop trying to
learn and achieve and eventually drop out of school. Or, like
Susan, they may become isolated and depressed.<p>
<p>
     Children with learning disabilities and attention
disorders may have trouble making friends with peers. For
children with ADHD, this may be due to their impulsive,
hostile, or withdrawn behavior. Some children with delays may
be more comfortable with younger children who play at their
level. Social problems may also be a product of their
disability. Some people with LD seem unable to interpret tone
of voice or facial expressions. Misunderstanding the situation,
they act inappropriately, turning people away.<p>
<p>
     Without professional help, the situation can spiral out of
control. The more that children or teenagers fail, the more
they may act out their frustration and damage their
self-esteem. The more they act out, the more trouble and
punishment it brings, further lowering their self-esteem.
Wallace, who lashed out when teased about his poor
pronunciation and was repeatedly suspended from school, shows
how harmful this cycle can be.<p>
<p>
     Having a child with a learning disability may also be an
emotional burden for the family. Parents often sweep through a
range of emotions: denial, guilt, blame, frustration, anger,
and despair. Brothers and sisters may be annoyed or embarrassed
by their sibling, or jealous of all the attention the child
with LD gets.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Support groups can be a source of information, practical
suggestions, and mutual understanding.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Counseling can be very helpful to people with LD and their
families. Counseling can help affected children, teenagers, and
adults develop greater self-control and a more positive
attitude toward their own abilities. Talking with a counselor
or psychologist also allows family members to air their
feelings as well as get support and reassurance.
<p>
     Many parents find that joining a support group also makes
a difference. Support groups can be a source of information,
practical suggestions, and mutual understanding. Self-help
books written by educators and mental health professionals can
also be helpful. A number of references and support groups are
listed at the end of this booklet.<p>
<p>
     Behavior modification also seems to help many children
with hyperactivity and LD. In behavior modification, children
receive immediate, tangible rewards when they act
appropriately. Receiving an immediate reward can help children
learn to control their own actions, both at home and in class.
A school or private counselor can explain behavior modification
and help parents and teachers set up appropriate rewards for
the child.<p>
<p>
     Parents and teachers can help by structuring tasks and
environments for the child in ways that allow the child to
succeed. They can find ways to help children build on their
strengths and work around their disabilities. This may mean
deliberately making eye contact before speaking to a child with
an attention disorder. For a teenager with a language problem,
it may mean providing pictures and diagrams for performing a
task. For students like Dennis with handwriting or spelling
problems, a solution may be to provide a word processor and
software that checks spelling. A counselor or school
psychologist can help identify practical solutions that make it
easier for the child and family to cope day by day.<p>
<p>
     Every child needs to grow up feeling competent and loved.
When children have learning disabilities, parents may need to
work harder at developing their children's self-esteem and
relationship-building skills. But self-esteem and good
relationships are as worth developing as any  skill.<p>

<p><h2> <a name="Sustaining Hope">Sustaining Hope</a></h2>
<p>
Susan<p>

<p>
     Susan is now in ninth grade and enjoys learning. She no
longer believes she's retarded, and her use of words has
improved. Susan has become a talented craftsperson and loves
making clothes and furniture for her sister's dolls. Although
she's still in a special education program, she is making slow
but steady progress in reading and math.<p>
<p>
<p>
Wallace<p>
<p>
<p>
     Over the years, Wallace found he liked tinkering with cars
and singing in the church choir. At church, he met a woman who
knew about learning disabilities. She told him he could get
help through his county social services office. Since then,
Wallace has been working with a speech therapist, learning to
articulate and notice differences in speech sounds. When he
complains that he's too old to learn, his therapist reminds
him, "It's never too late to work your good brain!" His state
vocational rehabilitation office recently referred him to a
job-training program. Today, at age 46, Wallace is starting
night school to become an auto mechanic. He likes it because
it's a hands-on program where he can learn by doing.<p>
<p>
<p>
Dennis<p>
<p>
<p>
     Dennis is now age 23. As he walks into the college job
placement office, he smiles and shakes hands confidently. After
shuffling through a messy stack of papers, he finally hands his
counselor a neatly typed resume. Although Dennis jiggles his
foot and interrupts occasionally, he's clearly enthusiastic.
He explains that because tape-recorded books and lectures got
him through college, he'd like to sell electronics. Dennis says
he'll also be getting married next year. He and his fiancee are
concerned that their children also will have LD. "But we'll
just have to watch and get help early-a lot earlier than I
did!"<p>

<p><h3> <a name="Can learning disabilities be outgrown">Can learning disabilities be outgrown or cured?</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     Even though most people don't outgrow their brain
dysfunction, people do learn to adapt and live fulfilling
lives. Dennis, Susan, and Wallace made a life for
themselves--not by being cured, but by developing their
personal strengths. Like Dennis' tape-recorded books and
lectures, or Wallace's hands-on auto mechanics class, they
found alternative ways to learn. And like Susan's crafts or
Wallace's singing, they found ways to enjoy their other
talents.<p>
<p>
     Even though a learning disability doesn't disappear, given
the right types of educational experiences, people have a
remarkable ability to learn. The brain's flexibility to learn
new skills is probably greatest in young children and may
diminish somewhat after puberty. This is why early intervention
is so important. Nevertheless, we retain the ability to learn
throughout our lives.<p>
<p>
<p>
     In many cases, an adult with dyslexia can learn to read.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Even though learning disabilities can't be cured, there is
still cause for hope. Because certain learning problems reflect
delayed development, many children do eventually catch up. Of
the speech and language disorders, children who have an
articulation or an expressive language disorder are the least
likely to have long-term problems. Despite initial delays, most
children do learn to speak.<p>
<p>
     For people with dyslexia, the outlook is mixed. But an
appropriate remedial reading program can help learners make
great strides.<p>
<p>
     With age, and appropriate help from parents and
clinicians, children with ADHD become better able to suppress
their hyperactivity and to channel it into more socially
acceptable behaviors. As with Dennis, the problem may take less
disruptive forms, such as fidgeting.
<p>
     Can an adult be helped? For example, can an adult with
dyslexia still learn to read? In many cases, the answer is yes.
It may not come as easily as for a child. It may take more time
and more repetition, and it may even take more diverse teaching
methods. But we know more about reading and about adult
learning than ever before. We know that adults have a wealth of
life experience to build on as they learn. And because adults
choose to learn, they do so with a determination that most
children don't have. A variety of literacy and adult education
programs sponsored by libraries, public schools, and community
colleges are available to help adults develop skills in
reading, writing, and math. Some of these programs, as well as
private and nonprofit tutoring and learning centers, provide
appropriate programs for adults with LD.<p>

<p><h3> <a name="What aid does the Government">What aid does the Government offer?</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     As of 1981, people with learning disabilities came under
the protection of laws originally designed to protect the
rights of people with mobility handicaps. More recent Federal
laws specifically guarantee equal opportunity and raise the
level of services to people with disabilities. Once a learning
disability is identified, children are guaranteed a free public
education specifically designed around their individual needs.
Adolescents with disabilities can receive practical assistance
and extra training to help make the transition to jobs and
independent living. Adults have access to job training and
technology that open new doors of opportunity.<p>
<p>
<p>
<STRONG>Increased services, equal opportunity</STRONG><p>
<p>
<p>
     The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1990
assures a public education to school-aged children with
diagnosed learning disabilities. Under this act, public schools
are required to design and implement an Individualized
Educational Program tailored to each child's specific needs.
The 1991 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act extended
services to developmentally delayed children down to age 5.
This law makes it possible for young children to receive help
even before they begin school.    <p>
<p>
     Another law, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,
guarantees equal employment opportunity for people with
learning disabilities and protects disabled workers against job
discrimination. Employers may not consider the learning
disability when selecting among job applicants. Employers must
also make "reasonable accommodations" to help workers who have
handicaps do their job. Such accommodations may include
shifting job responsibilities, modifying equipment, or
adjusting work schedules.<p>
<p>
     By law, publicly funded colleges and universities must
also remove barriers that keep out disabled students. As a
result, many colleges now recruit and work with students with
learning disabilities to make it possible for them to attend.
Depending on the student's areas of difficulty, this help may
include providing recorded books and lectures, providing an
isolated area to take tests, or allowing a student to tape
record rather than write reports. Students with learning
disabilities can arrange to take college entrance exams orally
or in isolated rooms free from distraction. Many colleges are
creating special programs to specifically accommodate theses
students.<p>
<p>
     Programs like these made it possible for Dennis to attend
and succeed in college. The HEATH Resource Center, sponsored by
the American Council on Education, assists students with
learning disabilities to identify appropriate colleges and
universities. Information on the HEATH center and related
organizations appears at the end of this brochure.<p>
<p>
<p>
<STRONG>Public agency support</STRONG><p>
<p>
<p>
     Effective service agencies are also in place to assist
people of all ages. Each state department of education can help
parents identify the requirements and the process for getting
special education services for their child. Other agencies
serve disabled infants and preschool children. Still others
offer mental health and counseling services. The National
Information Center for Children and Youth can provide referrals
to appropriate local resources and state agencies.<p>
<p>
     Counselors at each state department of vocational
rehabilitation serve the employment needs of adolescents and
adults with learning disabilities. They can refer adults to
free or subsidized health care, counseling, and high school
equivalence (GED) programs. They can assist in arranging for
job training that sidesteps the disability. For example, a
vocational counselor helped Wallace identify his aptitude for
car repair. To work around Wallace's language problems, the
counselor helped locate a job-training program that teaches
through demonstrations and active practice rather than
lectures.<p>
<p>
     State departments of vocational rehabilitation can also
assist in finding special equipment that can make it possible
for disabled individuals to receive training, retain a job, or
live on their own. For example, because Dennis couldn't read
the electronics manuals in his new job, a vocational
rehabilitation counselor helped him locate and purchase a
special computer that reads boo ks aloud.<p>
<p>
     Finally, state-run protection and advocacy agencies and
client assistance programs serve to protect these fights. As
experts on the laws, they offer legal assistance, as well as
information about local health, housing, and social services.<p>

<p><h3> <a name="What hope does research">What hope does research offer?</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
<p>
     Sophisticated brain imaging technology is now making it
possible to directly observe the brain at work and to detect
subtle malfunctions that could never be seen before. Other
techniques allow scientists to study the points of contact
among brain cells and the ways signals are transmitted from
cell to cell.<p>
<p>
     With this array of technology, NIMH is conducting research
to identify which parts of the brain are used during certain
activities, such as reading. For example, researchers are
comparing the brain processes of people with and without
dyslexia as they read. Research of this kind may eventually
associate portions of the brain with different reading
problems.                   <p>
<p>
     Clinical research also continues to amass data on the
causes of learning disorders. NIMH grantees at Yale are
examining the brain structures of children with different
combinations of learning disabilities. Such research will help
identify differences in the nervous system of children with
these related disorders. Eventually, scientists will know, for
example, whether children who have both dyslexia and an
attention disorder will benefit from the same treatment as
dyslexic children without an attention disorder.<p>
<p>
     Studies of identical and fraternal twins are also being
conducted. Identical twins have the same genetic makeup, while
fraternal twins do not. By studying if learning disabilities
are more likely to be shared by identical twins than fraternal
twins, researchers hope to determine whether these disorders
are influenced more by genetic or by environmental factors. One
such study is being conducted by scientists funded by the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. So
far, the research indicates that genes may, in fact, influence
the ability to sound out words.<p>
<p>
<p>
     By studying if learning disabilities are more likely to be

hope to determine whether these disorders are influenced more
by genetic or by environmental factors.<p>
<p>
<p>
     Animal studies also are adding to our knowledge of
learning disabilities in humans. Animal subjects make it
possible to study some of the possible causes of LD in ways
that can't be studied in humans. One NIMH grantee is
researching the effects of barbiturates and other drugs that
are sometimes prescribed during pregnancy. Another researcher
discovered through animal studies that certain prenatal viruses
can affect future learning. Research of this kind may someday
pinpoint prenatal problems that can trigger specific
disabilities and tell us how they can be prevented.<p>
<p>
     Animal research also allows the safety and effectiveness
of experimental new drugs to be tested long before they can be
tried on humans. One NIH-sponsored team is studying dogs to
learn how new stimulant drugs that are similar to Ritalin act
on the brain. Another is using mice to test a chemical that may
counter memory loss.<p>
<p>
     This accumulation of data sets the stage for applied
research. In the coming years, NIMH-sponsored research will
focus on identifying the conditions that are required for
learning and the best combination of instructional approaches
for each child.
<p>
     Piece by piece, using a myriad of research techniques and
technologies, scientists are beginning to solve the puzzle. As
research deepens our understanding, we approach a future where
we can prevent certain brain and mental disorders, make valid
diagnoses, and treat each effectively. This is the hope,
mission, and vision of the National Institute of Mental Health.<p>

<h2>Questions and Answers about Child Language</h2>
<h3>Courtesy of <br>
<a href="/ASHA/index.html">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association</a> </h3>
</center>

<H3>What is language?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Language is a code that we learn to use in order to communicate ideas and 
express our wants and needs. Reading, writing, speaking, and some gesture 
systems are all forms of language.
</ul>

<H3>What makes up this language code?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Language is made up of a series of rules for:<br><br>
 
<ul>
<li>creating words or signs from smaller units like sounds, letters, or 
body movements<br><br>

<li>modifying the meaning of root words (e.g., girl + -s = girls, walk + -ed 
= walked, teach +   -er = teacher, quick + ly = quickly, dis- +   obey = 
disobey)<br><br>

<li>combining words together (the grammar of   the language)
attaching meaning to words<br><br>

<li>holding a conversation; telling a story; and   using different forms of 
language for different  listeners, purposes, and situations.
</ul>
</ul>

<H3>What is speech?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Speech is the spoken form of language.
</ul>

<H3>How do children learn all these language rules?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Children learn language and speech by listening to the language around them and practicing what they hear. In this way, they figure out the  rules of the language code. It is not learned all   at once but in stages over time.
</ul>

<H3>How can parents help a child learn to talk?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Talk to the child. Read to the child. Encourage the child to talk, but don't demand speech.      Make talking fun.
</ul>

<H3>How do you know that a child's language and      speech are what they 
should be for a particular   age?</H3>

<ul>
<li>There are expected language behaviors for different ages. For example, by 1 year of age a  child should use one or two words, 
follow simple requests ("Come here"), and understand simple questions ("Where's your shoe?"). By 2 - 3 years of age, the child 
should be using two or three word sentences to talk about and ask for things 
and following two requests ("Get the ball and put it on the table"), Parents 
should also understand their child's speech most of the time.
<br><br>
<li>Children are individuals and do develop at slower or faster rates than 
expected. What is most important is that the child shows continuous language growth.
</ul>

<H3>When should I seek professional help?</H3>

<ul>
<li>When you become concerned. Don't delay.      No child is too young to be 
helped. If there is  a problem, early attention is important. If   there is no 
problem, you will be relieved of  worry.
</ul>

<H3>Will hearing problems affect speech and  language development?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Yes. The first years of life are particularly important for learning speech 
and language.      Even mild hearing losses may cause children      to miss 
much of the speech and language      around them and result in critical 
developmental delays. Parents should make sure that      their children receive a regular hearing      evaluation from an audiologist certified by      the 
American Speech-Language-Hearing      Association (ASHA), particularly if 
there is a  history of ear infections, frequent colds or  other upper 
respiratory infections, or allergies.

</ul>

<H3>Are there ever other physical causes of  language disability?</H3>

<ul>
<li>There are, but most often language disability   exists without any known 
physical cause.
</ul>

<H3>How about other causes?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes children are not exposed to enough language to learn the rules. Sometimes the child has no need to talk because parents respond to pointing and gestures instead of speech. But most language disabilities occur without an identifiable cause.
</ul>

<H3>What can be done about language disabilities?</H3>

<ul>
<li>A speech-language pathologist with experience   in child development can evaluate the child's  language development, design an organized  plan of language learning, and carry out the  plan in individual or small group sessions.      Educated at the master's or doctoral  level, certified by ASHA, and licensed in  almost all states, this professional will also  help you help your child.
</ul>

<H3>Where can I find a speech-language  pathologist?</H3>

<ul>
<li>Speech-language pathologists provide services  in schools, colleges and universities, hospitals,   clinics, private practices, and other settings. To      find a speech-language pathologist near you, write or call ASHA.
</ul>

<P> In its 1989 report, The Data Collection System of the AAPCC created a list of the 20 most frequently ingested plants.  Not suprisingly, there is a strong correlation between the list and top sellers in the plant industry.  Three of the listed plants genera, Toxicodendron, Phytolacca and Solanum are not commerically cultivated, but are extremely common in the wild. </p>
<p> These 20 plants are widely distributed on the continuum of toxic potential - from quite toxic to harmless - and thus show the full toxicity range of cultivated and wild plants.  Interestingly, while for the most part the listed plants are from widely divergent genera, several of the listed genera, Philodendron, Dieffenbachia, Brassaia and Spathiphyllum, are from the same Arum (Araceae) family.  The listed Arums, as well as many other plants from that family, tolerate the growing conditions in households well and thus are popular houseplants.  Arums also frequently contain calcium oxalate raphides in substantial quantities, as do all the listed Arums. </p>

<p> Listed below are the AAPCC's "Top 20", common names by which these plants are known, the frequency of ingestion, active toxins (if any) and toxic effects. The title of each is the botanical name. </p>

<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 6,1996 -- Two to four percent of America's children develop strabismus and/or amblyopia. The American Academy of Ophthalmology says early detection and treatment of these disorders during childhood are essential for preventing permanent vision loss.
</P>

<P>
<B>What Are Strabismus and Amblyopia?
</B></P>

<P>
 Strabismus is misalignment of the eyes. One eye may look straight ahead, while the other turns inward, outward, upward or downward. Although the problem appears to be improperly coordinated eye muscles, it is sometimes accompanied by vision loss.
</P>

<P>
 Amblyopia is reduced vision in one or both eyes as a consequence of failure to develop normal sight in early childhood. Amblyopia can result from a number of underlying abnormalities, including strabismus and focusing abnormalities.
</P>

<P>
<B>Detection of Amblyopia and Strabismus
</B></P>

<P>
 Vision screening can successfully detect reduced vision in one or both eyes resulting from amblyopia, strabismus, or focusing abnormalities. Pediatricians and other primary care physicians usually perform initial screening of babies and young children. Often, schools are responsible for detecting decreased vision in older children.
</P>

<P>
 Children with a family history of strabismus or amblyopia are at higher risk for development of these conditions and should see an ophthalmologist by the age of one.
</P>

<P>
 According to Dr. Susan Day, a San Francisco-based pediatric ophthalmologist and Academy spokesperson, the type of treatment that a child receives is dependent upon the underlying causes of amblyopia or strabismus. Prescription glasses often correct both misalignment of the eyes and visual disorders.
</P>

<P>
<B>Treatment Options
</B></P>

<P>
 Eye patching, also known as occlusion therapy, is another common treatment for amblyopia and strabismus. Patching a child's stronger eye forces him or her to use the weaker eye. Eye muscle surgery is another treatment option for some causes of strabismus. During the surgery, an ophthalmologist strengthens or weakens a patient's eye muscles. For some individuals, treatment with Botox, or botulinum toxin, is an alternative to eye muscle surgery. Botox injections weaken eye muscles pharmacologically, rather than surgically.
</P>

<P>
 As a general rule, all forms of treatment for strabismus and amblyopia work best when initiated in young patients. Regardless of their age, children should visit an ophthalmologist promptly if screening efforts indicate possible strabismus or amblyopia.
</P>

<P>
As Dr. Day emphasizes, &quot;No child is too young to receive treatment!&quot;
</P>

<P>
 For more information about amblyopia and strabismus, send a self- addressed, stamped envelope to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, P.O. Box 7424, San Francisco, CA 94120-7424.
</P>

<H4>Pragmatic Language Tips</H4>

<p>There are several ways parents and teachers can help children use language appropriately in social situations. Social language use is known as pragmatics.</p>

<p>Some general suggestions are provided to help children develop skills in three major pragmatic areas. These areas were discussed in a previous edition of Let's Talk (January, 1990). Although suggestions are geared primarily for preschool children, they can be modified for use with older children as well.</p>

<H4>Use of Different Language Functions</H4>


<ul>
<li>Ask questions or make
     suggestions to help a child use language for different purposes:

<ul>
<li>Desired Language Function	
<li>Suggested 	Question or 	Comment
</ul>


<ul> <li>Comment "What did you do"'  or "Tell me about ... 

    <li> Request"Tell your friend . . ."  or  "What do you want?"

    <li> Question " Ask me . ." 
</ul>
<br>
<li> Respond to a child's intended   message rather than correcting    the pronunciation or grammar;      but provide an appropriate      model in your own speech. For   example, if a child says, "That's how it doesn't go," respond, "You're right. That's not how it goes."

<br><br>
<li> Take advantage of naturally occurring interactions to increase use of different language functions. For example, practice greetings at the beginning of a day; have children ask peers what they want to eat for snacks; have children request necessary materials to complete an art project.
</ul>


<H4>Adaptive Language Use</H4>

<ul>
<li>Role play conversations that might occur with different   people in different situations.      For example, set up a situation      (or use one that occurs during      the course of a day) in which a      child has to explain the same      thing to different people. For      instance, a child might be asked
to teach the rules of a new
     game to a younger child and to an adult. If the child's explanations are the same for each listener, model different language patterns for an adult and a child listener.
<br><br>



<li>Encourage use of effective persuasion. Ask children what they would say, for example, to convince their parents to let them do something. Discuss
different ways to present a message:

<ul>
<li>polite ("Please may I go to the party?") vs. impolite ("You better let me go.");

<li>indirect ("That music is loud.") vs. direct ("Turn off the radio.").
</ul>


Discuss why some requests would be more persuasive than others.

</ul>

<H4>Conversation and Narration Skills</H4>

<ul>
<li>Comment on a child's topic of      conversation before introducing      a new topic. Add related      information. This will help a      child say more about a      particular topic.
<br><br>
<li>Provide visual prompts such as      pictures, objects, or a story      outline to help a child tell a      story in sequence.
<br><br>
<li>Encourage a child to rephrase      or revise an unclear word or      sentence. Provide an appropriate      revision by asking "Did you      mean . .
<br><br>
<li>Show how nonverbal signals are      important to communication.      For example, talk about what      happens when a facial      expression does not match the      emotion expressed in a verbal      message, e.g., using angry      words while smiling.
</ul>

<p>Use of suggestions such as these will help foster appropriate pragmatic language skills with children who might otherwise be at a disadvantage during social interactions.</p>

<H4>What is stuttering?</H4>

<ul><li>Stuttering is the condition in which the flow of speech is broken by abnormal stoppages (no sound), repetitions (st-st-stuttering), or prolongations (ssssstuttering) of sounds and syllables. There may also be unusual facial and body movements associated with the effort to speak.
</ul>


<H4>Aren't all people nonfluent to some extent?</H4>

<ul><li>Yes. Almost all children go through a      stage of frequent nonfluency in early      speech development. Adults may interject syllables ("uh") and occasionally      repeat words, phrases and sounds,      but these nonfluencies are accepted as      normal and usually are not a cause for      concern.
</ul>
<H4>Does stammering mean the same thing  as stuttering?</H4>

<ul><li>Most people use the terms
     interchangeably.
</ul>

<H4>What causes stuttering?</H4>

<ul><li>We still do not know for a fact what      causes stuttering. It may have different      causes in different people, or it may occur only when a combination of factors      comes together. It is also quite possible      that what causes stuttering is quite different from what makes it continue or      get worse. Possible influences include      incoordination of the speech muscles;      rate of language development; the way      parents and others talk to the child; and      other forms of communication and life      stress.
</ul>

<H4>Is stuttering caused by emotional or  psychological problems?</H4>

<ul><li>Children who stutter are no more likely      to have psychological problems than      children who do not stutter. In general,      there is no reason to believe that emotional trauma causes stuttering.
</ul>


<H4>At what age is stuttering likely to appear?</H4>

<ul><li>Stuttering typically begins at a very early age (usually between 2 and 5 years),      but will occasionally appear for the first      time in a school-age child and, more      rarely, in an adult.
</ul>

<H4>If I think my child is beginning to stutter, should I wait or seek help?</H4>

<ul><li>You should seek a professional evaluation as soon as you become concerned.      Most children outgrow their nonfluency,      but others will not. The problem of stuttering may be prevented from developing if treated early enough.
</ul>

<H4>Once stuttering has developed, can it be treated?</H4>

<ul><li>Yes, there are a variety of successful approaches for treating both children and      adults. There are no published scientific      data that indicate the general superiority of any one of these approaches.
</ul>

<H4>Can stuttering be "cured"?</H4>

<ul><li>It is best to avoid thinking in terms of an absolute "cure" for stuttering. Stuttering is not a disease. The goal should be to progress toward improved fluency  and success in communicating.
</ul>

<H4>What should I do when I hear a child speaking nonfluently?</H4>	


<ul><li>Children may be unaware that they are 	speaking nonfluently. Do not call attention to the nonfluent speech pattern. <br><br> 	

<li>Do not say "Stop and start over," 		"Think before you talk," "Talk slower," 		or "Cat got your tongue?" Listen patiently and carefully to what the child is 		saying, and do not focus on how it is 		being said.  	
</ul>

<H4>What should I do when I hear an adult stuttering?</H4>  	

<ul><li>Adults who stutter need the same patience and attention to their ideas as 		speakers who don't stutter. Don't look 		away and don't hurry them or fill in 		words. This attempt to help can create 		anxiety and self-consciousness and 		make the problem worse.  
</ul>

<H4>Who can help with this problem?</H4>  

<ul><li>A speech-language pathologist who has had experience in dealing with the stuttering problems of children and adults. The speech-language pathologist is the professional who is trained at the master's or doctoral degree level to evaluate the person who stutters and prepare a plan to improve speech.<br><br>

<li>Speech-language pathologists hold the Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) from the American Speech- Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and/or a license from your state.<BR><BR>

<H3>Children who read well tend to do well in school.</H3> 
<p>Those
who have trouble  reading, unless helped, generally have trouble with
school. But typically, parents must wait for low grades or notes from the
teacher to find out if their child is having trouble reading.<p>

<p>Now, new research from Boston University and Emerson College in Boston
suggests that a child's performance on certain language tasks may predict
later reading problems. This is true even when these children do not show
clear signs of language difficulties in daily life, say the researchers.<p>

 <p>    "Children who have trouble reading often have underlying
speech and language problems," says Paula Menyuk, professor of
developmental studies and applied linguistics at Boston University.<p>

<p>One hundred eighty children were tested three times between the ages of
1/2 and 7 1/2. The tests examined the children's performance at different
levels of language: sounds, words, sentences, and discourse. Then, when the
children reached first or second grade, they were tested for oral language,
reading, mathematics, and spelling abilities.<p>

<p>In the study, 48 children turned out to have reading problems. The
language tasks used by the Boston researchers in the first part of the
study identified 36 of these children.<p>

<p>Poor performance on three language tasks was an especially good
predictor of later reading problems:<p>

<ul>
<li> <STRONG>understanding complex sentences</STRONG>, such as "The boy who
kissed the girl ran away."
<p>
<li><STRONG>selecting missing words in sentences</STRONG>, such as "The
girls decorated the ______tree." (Christmas, big, bare)
<p>
<li> <STRONG>retrieving words rapidly</STRONG>, for example, quickly naming
a series of 36 unrelated pictures.
</ul>
<p> Some of the children who had reading problems had nothing remarkable in
their developmental histories except very low birthweight (under 1500
grams). Jacqueline Liebergott, professor of communication disorders at
Emerson, speculated that these early medical difficulties may have had an
effect on language development that was not apparent until the children
started to learn to read.<p>

<p>Being able to predict which children will have trouble reading would
allow speech-language pathologists and others to begin to work with them
before they fail, says Menvuk.<p>

<H4>What is language?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Language is a code that we learn to use in order to communicate ideas and 
express our wants and needs. Reading, writing, speaking, and some gesture 
systems are all forms of language.
</ul>

<H4>What makes up this language code?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Language is made up of a series of rules for:<br><br>
 
<ul>
<li>creating words or signs from smaller units like sounds, letters, or 
body movements<br><br>

<li>modifying the meaning of root words (e.g., girl + -s = girls, walk + -ed 
= walked, teach +   -er = teacher, quick + ly = quickly, dis- +   obey = 
disobey)<br><br>

<li>combining words together (the grammar of   the language)
attaching meaning to words<br><br>

<li>holding a conversation; telling a story; and   using different forms of 
language for different  listeners, purposes, and situations.
</ul>
</ul>

<H4>What is speech?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Speech is the spoken form of language.
</ul>

<H4>How do children learn all these language rules?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Children learn language and speech by listening to the language around them and practicing what they hear. In this way, they figure out the  rules of the language code. It is not learned all   at once but in stages over time.
</ul>

<H4>How can parents help a child learn to talk?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Talk to the child. Read to the child. Encourage the child to talk, but don't demand speech.      Make talking fun.
</ul>

<H4>How do you know that a child's language and      speech are what they 
should be for a particular   age?</H4>

<ul>
<li>There are expected language behaviors for different ages. For example, by 1 year of age a  child should use one or two words, 
follow simple requests ("Come here"), and understand simple questions ("Where's your shoe?"). By 2 - 3 years of age, the child 
should be using two or three word sentences to talk about and ask for things 
and following two requests ("Get the ball and put it on the table"), Parents 
should also understand their child's speech most of the time.
<br><br>
<li>Children are individuals and do develop at slower or faster rates than 
expected. What is most important is that the child shows continuous language growth.
</ul>

<H4>When should I seek professional help?</H4>

<ul>
<li>When you become concerned. Don't delay.      No child is too young to be 
helped. If there is  a problem, early attention is important. If   there is no 
problem, you will be relieved of  worry.
</ul>

<H4>Will hearing problems affect speech and language development?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Yes. The first years of life are particularly      important for learning speech 
and language.      Even mild hearing losses may cause children      to miss 
much of the speech and language      around them and result in critical 
developmental delays. Parents should make sure that      their children receive a regular hearing      evaluation from an audiologist certified by      the 
American Speech-Language-Hearing      Association (ASHA), particularly if 
there is a  history of ear infections, frequent colds or  other upper 
respiratory infections, or allergies.

</ul>

<H4>Are there ever other physical causes of   language disability?</H4>

<ul>
<li>There are, but most often language disability   exists without any known 
physical cause.
</ul>

<H4>How about other causes?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes children are not exposed to enough language to learn the rules. Sometimes the child has no need to talk because parents respond to pointing and gestures instead of speech. But most language disabilities occur without an identifiable cause.
</ul>

<H4>What can be done about language disabilities?</H4>

<ul>
<li>A speech-language pathologist with experience   in child development can evaluate the child's  language development, design an organized  plan of language learning, and carry out the  plan in individual or small group sessions.      Educated at the master's or doctoral  level, certified by ASHA, and licensed in  almost all states, this professional will also  help you help your child.
</ul>

<H4>Where can I find a speech-language  pathologist?</H4>

<ul>
<li>Speech-language pathologists provide services  in schools, colleges and universities, hospitals,   clinics, private practices, and other settings. To      find a speech-language pathologist near you, write or call ASHA.
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Keeping your child safe is a major priority for parents.  Here we have many excellent articles that will help parents protect their children.  They range from in-depth articles, to news items to checklists. Many of these are from the United States Consumer Safety Commission (CPSC). Unlike the other areas at KidSource, we're not rating these individually because we think they all are very important. <br><br>

Instead, we've sorted them by their primary area of interest:<br>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/kidsource/pages/health.pre.safety.in.html#home">Around the Home</a> </b>
<li> <b><a href="/kidsource/pages/health.pre.safety.in.html#clothing">Clothing </a></b>
<li> <b><a href="#poisoning">Poisoning </a></b>
<li> <b><a href="#Recreation">Recreation &amp; Travel </a></b>.
</ul>  

Or if it is of great interest for all parents, we've highlighted it in our Special Interest area.  
We suggest that you also refer to the <a href="/csps/recall.html"> Recall Notices </a> index for further safety related information. For additional information, refer to our overall list of <a href="/kidsource/pages/health.safety.in.html">Safety </a> articles.</p>

<P>Howard's teachers say he just isn't working up to
his ability.   He doesn't finish his assignments, or just
puts down answers without  showing his work; his
handwriting and spelling are poor.  He sits and  fidgets in
class, talks to others, and often disrupts class by
interrupting others.  He used to shout out the answers to
the  teachers' questions (they were usually right), but
now he day-dreams a  lot and seems distracted.  Does Howard
have Attention Deficit  Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
is he gifted, or both?   </P>
<P>     Frequently, bright children have been referred to
psychologists  or pediatricians because they exhibited
certain behaviors (e.g.,  restlessness, inattention,
impulsivity, high activity level,  day-dreaming)
commonly associated with a diagnosis of ADHD.  Formally,
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-III-R)  (American Psychiatric
Association) lists 14 characteristics that may  be found
in children diagnosed as having ADHD.  At least 8 of these
characteristics must be present, the onset must be
before age 7, and  they must be present for at least six
months. </P>

<a name="Diagnostic"></a>
<H3>DSM-III-R Diagnostic Criteria For Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder*</H3>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">

	<LI>  Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat (in
	adolescents may be limited to subjective feelings of
	restlessness).
	<LI>  Has difficulty remaining seated when required to.
	<LI>  Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli.
	<LI>  Has difficulty awaiting turns in games or group situations.
<LI>  Often blurts out answers to questions before they have
been  completed.
<LI>  Has difficulty following through on instructions
from others   (not due to oppositional behavior or failure
of comprehension).
<LI>  Has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play
activities.
<LI>  Often shifts from one uncompleted activity to
another.
<LI> Has difficulty playing quietly.
<LI> Often talks excessively.
<LI> Often interrupts or intrudes on others, e.g., butts
into other  people's games.
<LI>Often does not seem to listen to what is being said to
him or  her.
<LI>  Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities
at school  or at home (e.g., toys, pencils, books).
<LI>  Often engages in physically dangerous activities
without  considering possible consequences (not for the
purpose of  thrill-seeking), e.g., runs into street
without looking.
</OL>

<P>     Almost all of these behaviors, however, might be found in
bright,  talented, creative, gifted children.  Until
now, little attention has  been given to the similarities
and differences between the two groups,  thus raising the
potential for misidentification in both
areas-giftedness and ADHD.    </P>
<P>     Sometimes, professionals have diagnosed ADHD by simply
listening  to parent or teacher descriptions of the
child's behaviors along with  a brief observation of the
child.  Other times, brief screening  questionnaires are
used, although these questionnaires only quantify  the
parents' or teachers' descriptions of the behaviors
(Parker,  1992).  Children who are fortunate enough to
have a thorough physical  evaluation (which includes
screening for allergies and other metabolic  disorders)
and extensive psychological evaluations, which
include  assessment of intelligence, achievement, and
emotional status, have a  better chance of being
accurately identified.  A child may be gifted  and have
ADHD.  Without a thorough professional evaluation, it is
difficult to tell.  </P>

<a name="Situation"></a>
<H3>Consider the Situation and Setting</H3>
<P>     It is important to examine the situations in which a
child's  behaviors are problematic.  Gifted children
typically do not exhibit  problems in all situations.  For
example, they may be seen as  ADHD-like by one classroom
teacher, but not by another; or they may be  seen as ADHD at
school, but not by the scout leader or music teacher.
Close examination of the troublesome situation
generally reveals other  factors which are prompting the
problem behaviors.  By contrast,  children with ADHD
typically exhibit the problem behaviors in  virtually
all settings-including at home and at school-though the
extent of their problem behaviors may fluctuate
significantly from   setting to setting (Barkley, 1990),
depending largely on the structure  of that situation.
That is, the behaviors exist in all settings, but  are more
of a problem in some settings than in others. </P>
<P>     In the classroom, a gifted child's perceived inability
to stay on  task is likely to be related to boredom,
curriculum, mismatched  learning style, or other
environmental factors.  Gifted children may  spend from
one-fourth to one-half of their regular classroom time
waiting for others to catch up-even more if they are in a
heterogeneously grouped class.  Their specific level of
academic  achievement is often two to four grade levels
above their actual grade  placement.  Such children often
respond to non-challenging or  slow-moving classroom
situations by "off-task" behavior, disruptions,  or
other attempts at self-amusement.  This use of extra time
is often  the cause of the referral for an ADHD evaluation. </P>
<P>     Hyperactive is a word often used to describe gifted
children as  well as children with ADHD.  As with attention
span, children with  ADHD have a high activity level, but
this activity level is often  found across situations
(Barkley, 1990).  A large proportion of gifted  children
are highly active too.  As many as one-fourth may require
less sleep; however, their activity is generally
focused and directed  (Clark, 1992; Webb, Meckstroth, &amp;
Tolan, 1982), in contrast to the  behavior of children
with ADHD.  The intensity of gifted children's
concentration often permits them to spend long periods
of time and  much energy focusing on whatever truly
interests them.  Their specific  interests may not
coincide, however, with the desires and expectations  of
teachers or parents. </P>
<P>     While the child who is hyperactive has a very brief
attention  span in virtually every situation (usually
except for television or  computer games), children who
are gifted can concentrate comfortably  for long periods
on tasks that interest them, and do not require  immediate
completion of those tasks or immediate consequences.
The  activities of children with ADHD tend to be both
continual and random;  the gifted child's activity
usually is episodic and directed to  specific goals. </P>
<P>     While difficulties and adherence to rules and
regulations has  only begun to be accepted as a sign of ADHD
(Barkley, 1990), gifted  children may actively question
rules, customs and traditions,  sometimes creating
complex rules which they expect others to respect  or
obey. Some engage in power struggles. These behaviors
can cause  discomfort for parents, teachers, and peers. </P>
<P>     One characteristic of ADHD that does not have a
counterpart in  children who are gifted is variability of
task performance.  In almost  every setting, children
with ADHD tend to be highly inconsistent in  the quality of
their performance (i.e., grades, chores) and the amount
of time used to accomplish tasks (Barkley, 1990).
Children who are  gifted routinely maintain consistent
efforts and high grades in  classes when they like the
teacher and are intellectually challenged,  although
they may resist some aspects of the work, particularly
repetition of tasks perceived as dull.  Some gifted
children may  become intensely focused and determined
(an aspect of their  intensity) to produce a product that
meets their self-imposed  standards. </P>

<hr>

<a name="Teachers"></a>
<H3>What Teachers and Parents Can Do</H3>
<P>     Determining whether a child has ADHD can be particularly
difficult when that child is also gifted.  The use of many
instruments, including intelligence tests
administered by qualified  professionals, achievement
and personality tests, as well as parent  and teacher
rating scales, can help the professional determine the
subtle differences between ADHD and giftedness.
Individual evaluation  allows the professional to
establish maximum rapport with the child to  get the best
effort on the tests.  Since the test situation is
constant, it is possible to make better comparisons
among children.   Portions of the intellectual and
achievement tests will reveal  attention problems or
learning disabilities, whereas personality tests  are
designed to show whether emotional problems (e.g.,
depression or  anxiety) could be causing the problem
behaviors.  Evaluation should be  followed by
appropriate curricular and instructional
modifications  that account for advanced knowledge,
diverse learning styles, and  various types of
intelligence. </P>
<P>     Careful consideration and appropriate professional
evaluation are  necessary before concluding that
bright, creative, intense youngsters  like Howard have
ADHD.  Consider the characteristics of the
gifted/talented child and the child's situation.  Do not
hesitate to  raise the possibility of giftedness with any
professional who is  evaluating the child for ADHD;
however, do not be surprised if the  professional has had
little training in recognizing the  characteristics of
gifted/talented children (Webb, 1993).  It is  important
to make the correct diagnosis, and parents and teachers
may  need to provide information to others since
giftedness is often  neglected in professional
development programs. </P>

<H2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></H2>

     Imagine waking up one morning to find out that you have no
memory! You are not able to remember who you are or what
happened in your life, yesterday or the day before that. You
are unable to tell your children from total strangers, you
cannot communicate with people because you no longer know how
to greet them, or understand their conversation. You don't
remember what "the election," "war," or "the movies" mean.<br><br>

     Lack of historical memory is parallel to this loss of
individual memory. The link on which we depend every day
between the past and present would be lost if we had no memory
of our history. And we would miss a great source of enjoyment
that comes from piecing together the story of our past.<br><br>

     Today American educators are working to promote the study
of history in the schools and at home. Knowledge of our history
enables us to understand our nation's traditions, its
conflicts, and its central ideas and values. Knowledge of world
history enables us to understand other cultures.<br><br>

     We hope to encourage children to love history and to enjoy
learning about it. This booklet is a tool you can use to
stimulate your children's active involvement in the history
that surrounds them every day. It includes:<br><br>

<UL>
<LI>Basic information about history, and approaches to
     enjoying history with your children, aged 4-11;<br>

<LI>History activities that you and your children can do--at
     home, in your community, and out of town--for no or little
     cost; and<br>

<LI>History resources in your community and nationally, in
     bookstores, and libraries.

<H3>Children and History</H3>

     As parents we are in the best position to encourage our
children's natural interest in history. It is to us they
address their first historical questions: "Where did I come
from?" and "Was I always here?" These two questions contain
the two main meanings of "history": it is the story of people
and events, and it is the record of times past.<br><br>

     Now is the time to bring out the historical evidence and
to share family stories with your child. Birth and adoption
certificates, immunization records, first pieces of your
child's writing and art, as well as photographs all count as
historical sources that tell the story of your child.<br><br>

     The stories you tell and read to your children, or make up
with them, are part of their cultural heritage and reinforce
the two basic parts of history: "Once upon a time, and long
ago."<br><br>


 <H3>Parents Make a Difference</H3> 


     Your child is born into history. She has no memory of it,
yet she finds herself in the middle of a story that began
before she became one of its characters. She also wants to have
a place in it.<br><br>

     As parents we can prepare our children to achieve the
lifelong task of finding their place in history by helping them
to learn what shaped the world into which they were born.
Without information about their history, children don't "get" a
lot of what they hear and see around them.<br><br>

     Your attitude about history can also make a difference for
your child. Showing your interest in history--your belief that
knowing history makes a difference for your life--encourages
your child's own interest.<br><br>

     Many parents say they love history. If you are one of them
you can share your particular interests in history with your
children as well as help them develop their own.<br><br>

     Many other parents say they find history boring. If you
are among these, try one of the following: start writing your
own life story; read the diary of Anne Frank, or the
autobiography of Frederick Douglass; read the Declaration of
Independence, or rent a video about the Civil War. As you
rediscover history your children may be inspired by your
interest.<br><br>


 <H3>History Is a Habit </H3>

     The activities in this book can help you start doing
history with your child. You will probably get more ideas of
your own. In addition, you can develop some of the following
"history habits" that make history important not only during an
activity but every day.<br><br>


<B>History Habits for Parents</B><br><br>


     Habits are activities we do on a regular basis. We acquire
habits by choosing to make them a part of our life. It is worth
the time and effort to develop good habits because they enhance
our well-being. We suggest the following history habits to
enrich your life experience and your children's.<br><br>

     Share family history with your children, particularly your
memories. Help your own parents and other relatives know your
children and talk with them about family stories.<br><br>

     Participate in your community by voting and helping to
make changes in areas that interest you. Encourage your
children to vote in school elections, to present themselves as
candidates, and gain knowledge of history and the values and
behaviors that are the basis of their citizenship.<br><br>


     Read newspapers and news magazines, and watch television
news programs to maintain an informed judgment about the world.
Talk about current events and your ideas about them with your
children and other adults, and explore different points of
view. Check the encyclopedia or your local library for
additional historical information.<br><br>

     Watch television programs about important historical
topics with your family, and encourage conversation about the
program as you watch. Get library books on the same topic and
learn more about it. Check to see if the books and television
programs agree on significant issues, and discuss their
differences.<br><br>

     Read with your children about people and events that have
made a difference in the world, and discuss the readings
together. The list of publications at the end of this book
serves as a support to you for choosing materials.<br><br>

     Help children know that the makers of history are real
people like themselves, who have ideas, work hard, and
experience failure and success. Introduce them to local
community leaders in person if possible, and national and world
leaders via the media and biographies.<br><br>


     Make globes, maps, and encyclopedias available and use
every opportunity to refer to them. A reference to Africa in a
child's favorite story, or the red, white, and green stripes on
a box of spaghetti can be opportunities to learn more about the
world.<br><br>

     Have a collection of great speeches and written documents
to read from time to time with your child.<br><br>

     Your own involvement in history, in any of the forms
referred to in this book, is a good habit you can pass on to
your children.<br><br>


 <H3>Enjoying Your Child and History </H3>

     We have intentions of good fun as we plan any activity
with our children. We also want them to learn something from
most activities. They probably would say they want to have fun
and learn something new too. But sometimes the difference in
abilities between us and them, or the demands of time, end up
leaving us disappointed. Keeping the following in mind can help
keep your time together fun and productive:<br><br>

     You don't have to know all the facts or fully understand
history to help your children learn. Your willingness to learn
with them--to read, to ask questions, to search, and to make
mistakes--is the most important gift you can bring to the
process. By viewing their mistakes as sources of information
for future efforts, your children gain confidence to continue
learning.<br><br>

     Conversation gets you past the difficult moments. Keeping
open the communication between you and your children, and
encouraging continued discussion no matter how off the mark
your children may seem, tells them you take them seriously and
value their efforts to learn. The ability to have a conversation with your children profoundly affects what and how they learn.<br><br>

     Children have their own ideas and interests. By letting
them choose activities accordingly, you let them know their
ideas and interests are valuable. Often they will want to teach
you as a way to use what they know. Share their interests and
encourage them to learn more.<br><br>

     Make the most of everyday opportunities to do history:
visits from grandparents, reading books, telling stories,
holidays, elections, symbols like the flag, the national anthem
before sporting events, pictures in newspapers and magazines,
visits to museums. If your child asks about a person in a
painting, stop to find out who it is. Keep asking: "What does
this mean? How do I know?"<br><br>

     Choose your activities well. The activities in this
booklet are for children aged 4-11. Each of the activities can
be adapted to a child of any age and ability level. Even a
preschooler can "read" a newspaper with your help, for a short
period of time. While an activity that is too difficult will
frustrate your child, an activity that is too easy will lose
his interest. Challenges bring feelings of accomplishment.<br><br>

     Have a goal. When you choose or begin an activity you may
not have a clear idea of where it's going. But keep in mind
that the purpose of doing the activities in this book is to
learn something about history. The first section of this book,
the introduction to each activity, and the question boxes can
help you. As you complete each activity discuss with your child
what you learned together. Making bread is one thing, knowing
that bread has historical meaning is another. Achieving a goal
for an activity also helps your child sense the pleasure of a
completed project.<br><br>

 <H3>The Meanings of History</H3> 

     If you look for the meaning of "history" in the dictionary
you may be surprised to find that history is not simply the
past itself. The first meaning of history is "tale, story," and
the second meaning is "a chronological record of significant
past events." The opening of tales for children--"Once upon a
time"--captures both the story and time nature of history.<br><br>

     When we study history we are involved in a branch of
knowledge that records and explains past events. Many would say
that history is not just one branch of knowledge among others,
but that it is the most essential one because it is the
complete story of human endeavor. It happens that the word
"history" comes from the Greek "to know."<br><br>

     The activities in this book are organized according to the
two meanings of history as story and time in order to help you
explore these meanings with your child.<br><br>


<H4> The Story in History </H4>

     The work of doing history is to consider people and events
that are no longer in our presence. Unlike doing science, we do
history without being able to observe behavior and its results.<br><br>

     This work is fun when we make the past meaningful. We do
this by weaving together various pieces of information about
the past. In doing this we create a pattern that gives shape to
"just a bunch of facts." Doing history is a way of bringing the
past to life, in the best tradition of the storyteller.<br><br>

     But not just any story will do. While there are many
possible tales of the same event, good history is based on
evidence and several perspectives.<br><br>

     The history with which we are most familiar is political
history--the story of wars, peace treaties, and changes of
government. But anything that has a past has a history. This
includes the history of ideas, for example the concept of
freedom, and cultural history, for example the history of
music.<br><br>

     The story of history is interesting to us because it tells
us about real people who had ideas and beliefs, worked and
struggled to put them in action, and shaped the present in
which we find ourselves.<br><br>

 <H4>Time in History</H4> 

     Human events take place in time, one after the other. It
is important to learn the sequence of events in order to trace
them, reconstruct them, and weave the stories that tell of
their connections. Children need to learn the measures of time,
such as year, decade, generation, and century. When they hear
"Once upon a time in history" they need to be able to ask "When
did that happen?," and to know how to find the answer.<br><br>

     Time in history is a kind of relationship. We can look at
several events that all happened at the same time, and that
together tell a story about that period. Or we can look at the
development of an idea over time, and learn how and why it
changed. And we can consider the relationship between the past
and the present, or the future and the past (which is today!).
The present is the result of choices that people made and the
beliefs they held in the past, while the past, in being retold,
is in some way remade in the present. The future will be the
result of the coming together of several areas developing
today.<br><br>

     The main focus of history is the relationship between
continuity and change, and it is important that our children
understand the difference between them. For example, the
population of the United States has changed dramatically over
time with each wave of immigration. With the entry of these new
groups into American society, bringing their own ideas,
beliefs, and cultures, American democracy has continued and
grown stronger. It continues to function according to its
original purpose of safeguarding our basic values of freedom
and equality, even as the meanings and effects of these values
change.<br><br>


 <H3>A New Look at History </H3>

     History is now understood to be more than memorizing names
and dates. While being able to recall the details of great
people and events is important, the enjoyment of history is
enhanced by engaging in activities and experiencing history as
a "story well told."<br><br>

     Original sources and literature are real experiences.
Reading the actual words that changed the course of history,
and stories that focus on the details of time and place help
children know that history is about real people in real places
who made real choices that had some real consequences, and that
they could have made different choices.<br><br>

     Less can mean more. "A well-formed mind is better than a
well-stuffed mind," says an old proverb. Trying to learn the
entire history of the world is not only impossible, it feels
too hard and reduces our enthusiasm for history. In-depth study
of a few important events gives us a chance to understand the
many sides of a story. We can always add new facts.<br><br>

     History is hands-on work. Learning history is best done in
the same way we learn to use a new language, or to play
basketball: we do it as well as read about it. Doing history
means asking questions about historical events and characters;
searching our towns for signs of its history; talking with
others about current events and issues; writing our own stories
about the past.<br><br>

     There is no final word on history. There are good
storytellers and less good storytellers. And there are many
stories. But very rarely does any one storyteller "get it
right," or one story say it all. A good student of history will
always look for other points of view, knowing that our
understanding of history changes over time.<br><br>

     Your children do well to ask "So what?" Much that we take
for granted is not so obvious to our children. We should invite
them to clear up doubts they have about the reasons for
remembering certain things, getting facts right, and collecting
and judging evidence. At each step, asking "so what?" helps to
explain what is important and worth knowing, and to take the
next step with confidence.<br><br>


 <H3>Asking Questions </H3>
 
     At the end of each activity in this book, you will find a
series of questions that can help develop the critical thinking
skills children need to participate well in society, learn
history, and learn from history. The questions help them know
the difference between what is real, fantasy, and ideal, and
make the activity more interesting.<br><br>

     Critical thinking is judging the value of historical
evidence; judging claims about what is true or good; deciding
what information is important to have; looking at a topic from
different points of view; being curious enough to look further
into an event or topic; being skeptical enough to look for more
than one account of an event or life; and being aware that our
vision and thinking are often limited by our biases and
opinions.<br><br>

     The following two sections contain a sampling of history
activities, organized by the meanings of history as story and
time. Each group of activities is preceded by a review of three
elements of story and time from the perspective of history. The
review is meant to inform and support conversation between you
and your child, which is the most important step in each
activity by far.<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<H2><a name="Activities: History as Story">Activities: History as Story</a></H2>

<B>Records</B><br><br>

     History is a permanent written record of the past. Because
recording history is an essential part of doing history, a
"history log" is indicated for each activity. More recently,
history is also recorded on audio and video tape, and many of
the activities lend themselves to this type of recording as
well. Your children may be interested to know that the time of
their favorite dinosaurs is called "prehistory" because it is
unrecorded history. They should also know that some written
languages have been invented because telling stories orally,
without recording them in some form, is not by itself a sure
enough way to preserve the identity of a people.<br><br>


<B>Narration</B><br><br>

     George Washington, in his Farewell Address in 1796, said:
"Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am
unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too
sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have
committed many errors." This reflection is a good reminder that
history, with its facts and evidence, is also an interpretation
of the past. There is more than one cause for an event, more
than one kind of outcome, and more than one way of looking at
their relationship.<br><br>


<B>Evidence</B><br><br>

     All good histories are written on the basis of evidence.
Your children need to learn the importance of evidence, and to
distinguish it from biases, propaganda, stereotypes, and
opinion. They need to judge whether the many stories about John
F. Kennedy or World War I, for example, are based on solid
enough evidence to provide an accurate account of the life and
times.<br><br>

<a name="What's the Story"></a>
<H3>What's the Story</H3>

     History is a story well told. Through storytelling
children can understand what's involved in writing the stories
that make history.<br><br>

<B>What you'll need:</B><br><br>

<UL>
<LI>Family members and friends
<LI>A fairy tale or folk tale
<LI>History log
</UL>

<B>What to do</B><br><br>


 <OL>
<LI>  Tell a story of a person you know. Gather your children,
     other family members, and friends to have a storytelling
     session. Choose a person you know about whom the group
     will tell the story. Decide who will begin, and go
     clockwise from there with each person adding to the story.
     Set a time limit so that you must end the story somewhere.

<LI>  Read a folk story or fairy tale, for example, Little Red
     Riding Hood or The Story of Johnny Appleseed. Talk about 
     how the story begins and ends, who the characters are and
     what they feel, and what happens. Ask how this story based
     on fantasy is different from the story you told about the
     real person you know.

<LI>   Read a story about an historical event. Now pick a moment
     in world history, for example the fall of the Berlin Wall,
     the French and Indian War, or a current event in the news
     headlines. Ask the librarian for help in choosing material
     that is at your child's reading level.

<LI>   Help your child write in the history log about this
     storytelling experience.
</OL>

     In the storytelling session about the person you know, how
did you verify the "truth" when there were differences of
opinion about what "really happened"? If you were to write the
story of a real event for the newspaper, what would count for
you the most in preparing it? What else would you include?
Where would you get your information? How would you check the
accuracy of the information?<br><br>

<a name="Our Town"></a>
<H3>Our Town</H3>

     Your phone book, newspaper, and other resources can serve
as your best guide to history in your town. Not only does
referring to them save time, it teaches how to use tools to get
information.<br><br>

<B>What you'll need:</B><br><br>

<UL>
<LI>Phone books, both yellow and white pages
<LI>Daily city newspaper
<LI>Community newspaper
<LI>History log
</UL>

<B>What to do</B><br><br>

<ol>
  <li> Newspaper search. Look in your city and community
     newspapers. They list "things to do." Look for parades, 
     museum and art exhibits, music events, children's theater,
     history talks and walks.<br><br>

     Participate in an event and help your child write about it
     in the history log when you get back home.<br><br>

     For more help, call education services at your city 
     newspaper. Ask about their education programs that use
     newspapers.<br><br>

<li>  Phone book search. Look in your phone books under
     "History" or "Historical Places." You will find a few
     places under this heading but many more are listed
     elsewhere.<br><br>

     Brainstorm with your children about what other words to
     look under in the phone book to find local history.<br><br>

     Call the places you find. -Ask about their programs,
     hours, and upcoming special events. Ask to be put on their
     mailing list. Also ask where else you should go to learn
     about your town's history.<br><br>

     Your younger children should listen to your phone
     conversation. They learn how to ask for information by
     listening to you.<br><br>

 <li> Begin a list in the history log of local historical sites.
     Include phone numbers, addresses, hours of operation, and 
     other useful information for future visits.<br><br>

     Visit the historical places in your child's history book,
either in person or by collecting materials.<br><br>

<B>What you'll need:</B><br><br>

<UL>
<LI>Your child's history book
<LI>Maps, guidebooks
<LI>History log
</UL>

<B>What to do</B><br><br>

<ol>
  <li> Find out what historical events your child is studying in
     school. Perhaps a historical site is near your town.
     Choose a site of one of these events to visit in person or
     through the materials you collected.<br><br>

  <li> Prepare the trip together in advance. Ask the librarian to
     help you and your child find books and videos on the
     history of the town or the historical figures who lived
     there.<br><br>

  <li> Call the Chamber of Commerce of the area for maps and
     guidebooks.<br><br>

  <li> Make a list. Think of some questions you want answered on
     your trip.<br><br>

  <li> Talk about the place you are visiting.<br><br>

  <li> Have your child write about the trip in the history log.
     Include answers to the questions that were answered that
     day.<br><br>

  <li> Have your children make up a quiz for parents, or a game,
     based on the trip.<br><br>

  <li> Encourage your child to read more stories about the place
     you visited and the people who were part of its history,
     and historical documents that are associated with the
     site. For example, in visiting Akron, Ohio, the site of
     the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in 1851, you might read
     Sojourner Truth's address, known also as And Ain't I a
     Woman?<br><br>

<LI>Weekly news magazine
<LI>A daily national news program
<LI>Highlighter
<li>History log

<B>What to do</B><br><br>

<ol>
  <li> Decide on how often you will do this activity with your
     children--current events happen every day. This activity
     can be most useful to younger children if it is done from
     time to time to get them used to the idea of "news." Older
     children benefit from doing it more often, at least once a
     week if possible.<br><br>

 <li> Look through the newspaper or news magazine with your
     child. Ask him to decide what pictures or headlines are
     related to history. Highlight these references. Some
     examples are the Yalta Treaty, the French Revolution,
     Lenin, Pearl Harbor, or Brown v. Board of Education.<br><br>

 <li> Together read the articles you have chosen. Write down any
     references to events that did not happen today or
     yesterday, or to people who were not alive recently.<br><br>

  <li> Have a conversation with your child about what these past
     events and people have to do with what's happening today.
     Help your child write in the history log the connections
     you find between past and present.<br><br>

  <li> Watch the evening news or a morning news program together.
     Write down as many references as possible to past history
     and discuss the links you find between these references
     and the news story you heard.<br><br>

  <li> During another viewing, help your child focus on how the
     information was communicated: did the newscaster use
     interviews, books, historical records, written historical
     accounts, literature, paintings, photographs?<br><br>

  <li>. Help your child compare several accounts of a major news
     story from different news shows, newspapers, and news
     magazines.<br><br>

     time to obtain information brochures and a map. Living
     history museums are located in Williamsburg, VA and Old
     Sturbridge Village, MA, among other places.

  <LI> Plan how to actually "visit history." Pretend to be a
     family living in the historical place. What would it be
     like to be a family living in the place you choose to go?

  <LI> When you visit the museum, ask your child what his
     favorite object or activity is, and why.

  <LI> Help your children sketch something in the museum, and put
     it in the history log. Tell your children that this is the
     way history was visually recorded before there were
     cameras.

 <LI> Use your camera, if you have one, to make a "modern day"
     record of history, and create a scrapbook with the
     photographs of what you saw.

 <LI> When you get home, talk about what it would have been like
     to live in that historical place in that period of time.

<H3>Cooking Up History</H3>

     Every culture has its version of bread. "Eating it, one
feels that the taste one cannot quite put to words may almost
be the taste of history."* Children enjoy making this American
Indian fried bread.<br><br>

<B>What you'll need</B><br><br>

<UL>
<LI>2 1/2 cups all-purpose or wheat flour
<LI>1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
<LI>1 teaspoon salt
<LI>1 tablespoon dried skimmed milk powder
<LI>3/4 cup warm water
<LI>1 tablespoon vegetable oil
<LI>Oil for frying
<LI>
<LI>Mixing bowls and spoons, spatula
<LI>Large skillet
<LI>Cloth towels
<LI>Baking sheet
<LI>Paper towels
<LI>
<LI>History log
</UL>

<B>What to do</B><br><br>

<ol>
<li> In a large bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder,
     and salt.

<li>  In a small bowl, stir together the dried milk, water, and
     vegetable oil.

<li>  Pour this liquid over the dry ingredients and stir
     until the dough is smooth (1 or 2 minutes). Add 1
     tablespoon of flour if the dough is too soft.

<li>  Knead the dough in the bowl with your hands about
     30 seconds. Cover it with a cloth and let it sit 10
     minutes.

<li>  Line the baking sheet with paper towels to receive the
     finished loaves.

   * From Edward Behr (see Acknowledgments).

<li>  Divide the dough into eight sections. Take one section and
     keep the rest covered in the bowl.

 <li> Roll the dough into a ball and flatten with your hand.
     Then roll it into a very thin circle 8 to 10 inches
     across. The thinner the dough, the puffier the bread will
     be.

 <li> Cover this circle with a cloth.

 <li> Continue with the other seven sections of dough in the
     same way.

 <li> In the large frying pan or skillet, pour vegetable oil to
     about 1 inch deep.

 <li> As you begin to roll the last piece of dough, turn on the
     heat under the skillet. When the oil is hot, slip in a
     circle of dough. Fry for about 1 minute or until the
     bottom is golden brown. Reminder: Parental supervision is
     necessary at all times around a hot stove.

 <li> Turn the dough over with tongs or a spatula. Fry the other
     side for 1 minute.

 <li> Put the fried bread on the baking sheet and continue with
     the other rounds of dough.

 <li> Eat your fried bread while it is hot and crisp. Put honey
     on it if you like. Write in your history log what you
     learned about this bread and others you have tried.
</ol>

     How is this bread different from other breads you have
tried? Think of common expressions that use the word "bread."
For example, "the nation's breadbasket"; "I earn my bread and
butter"; or "breadlines of the 1920s." What does "bread" mean
in each of these? What place does bread have in your daily life
and in other cultures? <br><br>

     Younger children find rubbings great fun. Cornerstones and
plaques are interesting, and even coins will do. <br><br>

<B>What You'll Need</B> <br><br>

<ul>
<li>Tracing paper or other light weight paper
<li>Large crayons with the paper removed, fat lead pencil, colored
     pencils, or artist's charcoal
<li>History log
</ul>
[Graphic Omitted] <br><br>

<B>What to do</B> <br><br>

<ol>
 <li> Help your child make a kit to do rubbings. It could
     include the items listed. The paper should not tear easily
     but it should also be light enough so that the details of
     what is traced become visible.

  <li> Have children make a rubbing of a quarter or half dollar.
     Make the coin stable by supporting it with tape. Double
     the tape so that it sticks on both sides and place it on
     the bottom of the coin. Lay the paper on top of the coin,
     and rub across it with a pencil, crayon, or charcoal.
     Don't rub too hard. Rub until the coin's marks show up.

  <li> Go outside to do a rubbing. Look for
<ul>
  <li> Dates imprinted in cement sidewalks

  <li> Cornerstones and plaques on buildings

  <li> Decorative ironwork on buildings and lampposts

  <li> Art and lettering on monuments and around doorways
</ul>
  <li> Your child can ask family members to guess what each
     rubbing is.

  <li> Have the children tell about each rubbing. Tell them to
     look for designs and dates among the rubbings.

  <li> Children may want to cut some of their rubbings out to
     include in their history logs. Or they can fit several on
     one piece of paper to show a pattern of dates and designs.
</ol>

     What showed up in your rubbings? What did the date and
designs commemorate? Historical preservation groups in America
have worked to preserve old buildings and to install plaques on
public historical places. Is this interesting or important
work? Why have humans left their marks on the world from early

<H2><a name="Activities: History as Time">Activities: History as Time</a></H2>

<H4>Chronology</H4>

     While our children need the opportunity to study events in
depth to get an understanding of them, they also need to know
the sequence of historical events in time, and the names and
places associated with them. Being able to place events in
time, your child is better able to learn the relationships
among them. What came first? What was cause, and what was
effect? Without a sense of chronological order, events seem
like a big jumble, and we can't understand what happened in the
past. It matters, for example, that our children know that the
American and French Revolutions are related.<br><br>


<H4>Empathy</H4>

     Empathy is the ability to put ourselves in the place of
another person and time. Since history is the reconstruction of
the past, we must have an idea of what it was like "to be
there" in order to reconstruct it with some accuracy. For
example, in studying the westward expansion your children may
ask why people didn't fly across the country to avoid the
hazards of exposure on stagecoach trails. When you answer that
the airplane hadn't yet been invented, they may ask why not.
They need an understanding of how technology develops and its
state at the time. Using original source documents, such as
diaries, logs, and speeches, helps us guard against imposing
the present on the past, and allows us to see events through
the eyes of people who were there.<br><br>


<H4>Context</H4>

     Context is related to empathy. Context means "weave
together" and refers to the set of circumstances in several
areas that framed an event. To understand any historical period
or event our children should know how to weave together
politics (how a society was ruled), sociology (what groups
formed the society), economics (how people worked and what they
produced), and religion, literature, the arts, and philosophy
(what was valued and believed at the time). When they try to
understand World War II, for example, they will uncover a
complex set of events. And they will find that these events
draw their meaning from their context.<br><br>

     History means having a grand old time with new stories.
So, think about the relationship between history and time as
you do the following activities.<br><br>

<a name="Time Marches On"></a>
<H3>Time Marches On</H3>

     The stories of history have beginnings, middles, and ends
that show events, and suggest causes and effects. A personal
timeline helps your child picture these elements of story.<br><br>

<B>What you'll need</B><br><br>

<UL>
<LI>Paper for timeline
<LI>Colored pencils
<LI>Crayons
<LI>Shelf paper or computer paper
<LI>Removable tape
<li>History log (optional)
</UL>

<B>What to do</B><br><br>

<ol>
<li> Draw on a piece of paper, or in the history log, a
     vertical line for the timeline. Mark this line in even
     intervals for each year of your child's life.

<li> Help your child label the years with significant events,
     starting with your child's birthday.

<li> Review the timeline. Your child may want to erase and
     change an event for a particular year to include a more
     memorable or important one. (Historians also rethink their
     choices when they study history.)

 <li> For a timeline poster, use a long roll of shelf paper or
     computer paper. For a horizontal timeline, fasten it to
     the wall up high around the room using removable tape so
     that your child can take it down to add more events or
     drawings. For a vertical timeline, hang it next to the
     doorway in your child's room. Start with the birthday at
     the bottom. Your child can begin writing down events and
     add to it later.

 <li> For older children, have them do a timeline of what was
     happening in the world at the same time as each event of
     their life. To begin, they can use the library's
     collection of newspapers to find and record the headlines
     for each of their birthdays.
</OL>

     What is the most significant event on the timeline? What
effects did the event have on your child's life? What are the
connections between the events in your child's life and world
events at the time?<br><br>

     A history web is a way of connecting people and events. Is
there an old ball field in your town you've always wondered
about? Or did you ever wonder why there are so many war
memorials in your town? Then you need to do a history web!<br><br>

<B>What you'll need</B><br><br>

<UL>

<LI>Large piece of paper or poster board (at least
<LI>     3 1/2 x 2 1/2 ft.)
<LI>Colored pencils or markers
<LI>History log
</UL>

<B>What to do</B><br><br>

<ol>
<LI> Pick a place in your community that has always seemed
     mysterious to you--an old ball field, general or hardware
     store, house, or schoolhouse.

     Or ask yourself. "What are there lots of in my town?"
     Churches, fountains? Pick one of these historical
     "families."

<li> Go to one of these places. Jot down in your history log
     what you see and hear there. For example, look for marks
     on the buildings, such as dates and designs, or parts of
     the buildings, such as bleachers or bell towers.

<li> Find out other information about the place by asking a
     librarian for resources, or by searching the archives of
     your local newspaper. Look for major events that took
     place there, such as the setting of a world record or the
     visit of a famous person. Also look for other events that
     changed the place, such as modernization or dedications.

<li> Find people who have lived in your town a long time.
     Interview them using questions about these major and
     related events, and any others they remember.

<li> Draw a web, with the name of the place you studied in the
     middle (like the spider who weaves a "home").

<li> Draw several strands from the middle to show the major
      events in the life of the place.

<li> Connect the strands with cross lines to show other related
     events.

<Li> When the web is complete consider the relationships among
     the strands. (See parent box.)

 <LI> Ask the editor of your local newspaper to publish your
     web. Ask readers to contribute more information to add to
     it. This is exactly how history is written!
</ol>

     When was the place you picked built? If you picked a
"family" of places, when was each place built? If they were
built around the same time, what similarities and differences
do you notice about their features, such as style and what they
commemorate? How is the place you picked connected to other
events in history?<br><br>

 <H3>Quill Pens and Berry Ink </H3>

     Knowing how to write has been a valued skill throughout
history. History itself depends on writing, and writing has
changed over time from scratches on clay to computerized
letters.<br><br>

<B>What you'll need</B><br><br>

<ul>
<LI>For quill pen:<br><br>

     feather, scissors, a paper clip<br><br>

<LI>For berry ink:<br><br>

     1/2 cup of ripe berries, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon 
     vinegar, food strainer, bowl, wooden spoon, small jar with
     tight-fitting lid<br><br>

<LI>Paper
<LI>Paper towel
<LI>History log
</ul>

<B>What to do</B><br>

<ol>
<LI> Make the ink: Collect some berries for your ink. Consider
     what color you want your ink to be, and what berries are
     available. Blueberries, cherries, blackberries,
     strawberries, or raspberries work well. Fill the strainer
     with berries and hold it over the bowl. Crush the berries
     against the strainer with the wooden spoon so that the
     berry juice drips into the bowl. When all the juice is out
     of the berries, throw the pulp away. Add the salt and
     vinegar to the berry juice and stir well. If the ink is
     too thick, add a teaspoon or two of water, but don't add
     too much or you'll lose the color. Store the ink in a
     small jar with a tight-fitting lid. Make only as much as
     you think you will use at one time, because it will dry up
     quickly.

<LI> Make the pen: Find a feather. Form the pen point by
     cutting the fat end of the quill on an angle, curving the
     cut slightly. A good pair of scissors is safer than a
     knife. Clean out the inside of the quill so that the ink
     will flow to the point. Use the end of a paper clip if
     needed. You may want to cut a center slit in the point;
     however, if you press too hard on the pen when you write,
     it may split.

 <LI> Write with the pen: Dip just the tip of the pen in the
     ink, and keep a paper towel handy to use as an ink
     blotter. Experiment by drawing lines, curves, and single
     letters, and by holding the pen at different angles. Most
     people press too hard or stop too long in one spot.

 <LI> Practice signing your name, John Hancock style, with the
     early American letters shown here. Then write your
     signature in your history log.

 <LI> Write your name again using a pen or pencil. Compare the
     results.

<B>What to do</B><br><br>

<OL>
 <LI> Talk about what school was like when you were a child.
     Include how schools looked physically (e.g., one-room
     schoolhouse or campus?); what equipment teachers used
     (e.g., chalk boards or computers?); what subjects you
     studied; what choices you faced (e.g., transportation to
     and from school, extracurricular activities ); and
     favorite teachers.<BR><BR>

 <LI> Talk about what school was like 50 or 100 years ago. Ask
     your librarian for help in looking this up, and talk to
     older relatives.<br><br>

     Include the history of work in America and how this
     affects schooling. For example, when America was an
     agricultural society, children were needed to help plant
     and harvest crops. It was common then that children didn't
     go to school every day, or in the summer.<br><br>

     Have children draw a variety of crops or animals raised in
     the United States, including those grown in their own
     state or neighborhood. They can draw either right on the
     map or on paper that they will cut and paste on the
     appropriate state. The map can be traced from an atlas in
     the library or from a geography book. Talk about when
     various crops are planted and harvested, and the effects
     of growing seasons on migrant worker families.<br><br>

     Talk about another change in work in America and how it
     affected schooling. For example, when America was becoming
     a manufacturing economy, during the Industrial Revolution,
     laws were made against child labor and for mandatory
     schooling.<br><br>

     Help your child talk about how the work of parents in
     America today affects schooling, for example, the need for
     afterschool programs.<br><br>

 <LI> Imagine what school will be like in the future. Younger
     children may want to use blocks to build their future
     school, and older children may want to draw theirs.<BR><BR>
</ol>

     What has remained the same about school from the past to
the present? What has changed? If you could be the head of a
school 20 years from now, what would you keep and what would
you change based on your current school? How would you go about
making the changes?<br><br>

<B>What to do</B><br><br>

<OL>
  <LI>Have your children look at U.S. coins for the expression
     "E pluribus unum", and translate it for them: "One out of
     many." Explain to them that it refers to America as one
     nation with many peoples and cultures, and that it is not
     a common nationality but shared democratic values that
     bind us as a nation.<BR><BR>

  <LI> With your children talk about the following list of
     holidays celebrated in the United States. Look at a
     calendar to add other holidays, and next to each holiday
     write when it is celebrated and what is celebrated.<br><br>

 <LI> Use the opportunity of talking about what holidays
     celebrate to read original sources. For example: on
     Presidents' Day read one of the great presidential
     speeches such as the Gettysburg Address; on Martin Luther
     King's Day read the "I Have a Dream" speech.

  <LI>Find holidays celebrated in other nations. Classmates,
     neighbors, and relatives from other countries are good
     sources of information.

  <LI> Think and talk about other important holidays our nation
     should celebrate.

  <LI> Discuss what your family celebrates, and have your
     children write about the discussion in their history log.

     What kinds of accomplishments or events do we celebrate in
America? What similarities and differences did you find between
American holidays and holidays celebrated by people from other

     Reenactments of historical battles or periods, such as
colonial times, make our nation's history come alive. And they

     What was unusual or interesting about the reenactment?
What role did each of the reenactors play? If there was
conflict, what was shown or said about its causes? What
obstacles did the characters face? How did they overcome them?
What is the difference between the "real thing" and a
performance of it? What did you learn from the performance?<br><br>

<B>What to do</B><br><br>

<OL>
 <li> Find out where reenactments are held by looking in your
     local newspaper or calling your local historical society,
     State Park, or National Park Service.

 <LI> Choose one, and prepare your child to see it by visiting a
     local museum or historical site that relates to the
     reenactment, or by watching a television program about the
     event or period to be reenacted. Use your local librarian
     and TV guide as resources.

 <LI> Attend the reenactment and participate. Ask the reenactors
     questions about anything--from the kind of hat they are
     wearing to the meanings of the event or period for the
     development or transformation of America. Finally, help
     your child write about this experience in the history log.<BR><BR>

<H3>Parents and the Schools</H3>

     Educators and education policymakers at the national and
state levels support an expanded history curriculum in our
schools. Parents and schools can be partners in this endeavor
as they work toward their common goal of educating children.
Following are some well-proven measures for supporting your
children's study of history at school, and for forming
productive relationships with those responsible for their
education away from home:<br><br>
<OL>
<LI> Become familiar with your school's history program. Ask
yourself:<br><br>
<ul>
 <li> What do I see in my child's classroom that shows history
     is valued there? For example, are maps, globes, atlases,
     and original source documents visible?

  <LI> Are newspapers and current events media part of the
     curriculum? Are biographies, myths, and legends used to
     study history?

   <LI> Does my child regularly have history homework, and history
     projects periodically, including debates and mock trials?

  <LI> Are there field trips relating to history?

  <LI> Is my child encouraged to ask questions and look for
     answers from reliable sources?

  <LI> How is knowledge of history assessed in addition to tests
     based on the textbook?

  <LI> Are my children learning history in elementary and middle
     school, and are the history curriculums well coordinated?

  <LI> Does the history curriculum include world history as well
     as American history?

  <LI> Does my school require teachers to have studied history?
     Or does it assign history classes to teachers with little
     or no background?<br><BR>
</ul>

<LI> Talk often with your child's teachers.<br><BR>

<ul>
  <LI> Attend parent-teacher conferences early in the school
     year.

  <LI> Listen to what teachers say during these conferences, and
     take notes.

  <LI> Let teachers know that you expect your child to gain a
     knowledge of history, and that you appreciate their
     efforts towards this goal.

  <LI> Ask the teachers what their expectations of the class and
     your child are.

  <LI> Agree on a system of communication with the teachers for
     the year, either by phone or in writing twice a semester,
     and whenever you are concerned.

  <LI> Keep an open mind in discussing your child's education
     with teachers; ask questions about anything you don't
     understand; and be frank with them about your concerns.<br><BR>
</ul>

<LI> Help to improve history education in your child's school.<br><BR>

<ul>
  <LI> Volunteer in your children's history class, for example,
     to organize visits from the mayor or local historians, and
     to local historical sites.

   <LI> If you feel dissatisfied with the history program, talk to
     your children's teachers first, and then to the principal,
     history curriculum division, superintendent, and finally
     the school board. Also talk to other parents for their
     input.<BR><BR>

The first phase centered on the need for"computer literacy," generally defined as computer awareness andcomputer programming. At the height of the computer literacy debate,emphasis shifted to the role of the computer as a tool, and as amethod for teaching problem solving. Most recently, attention amongeducators has turned to yet a third phase. This third phase addressesissues related to computer applications in support of the curriculum.<p></P><P>Research studies (Reinking, 1988) indicate clearly that computerinstruction is effective for a wide variety of reading skill andconcept areas. The level of popularity of computer-based instructionin reading may vary, but few will dispute the fact that computers havewon a permanent place in most classrooms. The most common concerns ofeducators now have to do with the effectiveness of computer-basededucation, and with the appropriateness of the many possible rolescomputers can play in language arts instruction.<p></P><P>The emphasis should not be on using computers to increase reading andwriting achievement, but rather on whether teachers use computers formeaningful reading and writing instruction, or are locked intocomputer-based drill and practice software. This digest will focus onhow teachers can integrate computers into reading/writing instruction.<p></P><P>The following guidelines may also be used as a checklist to helpteachers of the language arts match their use of computers with whatis known about the reading/writing process. We hope that the checklistwill be used in a context where students are given opportunities towork in all the various computer modes: tool, tutor, and tutee.</P><a name="Guidelines"></a><H3>Guidelines For Computers and Reading</H3><OL Type= numeric><LI> Computer instruction in reading should focus on meaning and stressreading comprehension.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to work with whole, meaningfultexts. Programs that offer learners a chance to process large chunksof related text, rather than bits and pieces of unrelated languagefragments, allow students to use and extend what they know aboutreading comprehension.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to work with word-recognitionprograms that stress the use of word meanings in conjunction withphonics and structural analysis. Care must be taken to make sure that,when programs feature the study of individual words and phrases, theyare offered within a contextual framework that help them make sense tothe learner. Assessment programs for teachers should also be providedin meaningful context.<BR><BR>*Learners should have the opportunities to apply the skills beingtaught in some meaningful way. Programs that deny the learner anopportunity to make use of what is being "taught" are merelyassessment tools and do little to further the learner's growth.<BR><BR>*Learners should have the opportunity to work with computer materialsthat use content and language that are within the range of theirconceptual development. Tasks should be challenging but notfrustrating. Student interests, previous experiences, and purpose playa role in determining whether or not a computer task is comprehensibleand worthwhile.<BR><BR><LI> Computer instruction in reading should foster active involvementand stimulate thinking.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to discuss the purpose of thecomputer task or program as well as its nature. They should be awarenot only of what they are supposed to do but also of why doing it isimportant.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to make decisions that control orinfluence the computer task. Programs that build in opportunities forstudents to make choices and test predictions help them learn to thinkand act on their own rather than merely react to someone else'sthinking.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to monitor their own learning.Tasks that offer students opportunities to self-check and correcttheir own errors support the development of independent learners.<BR><BR><LI> Computer instruction in reading should support and extend students'knowledge of text structures.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to encounter a wide variety oftext structures upon which to apply and refine their comprehensionskill. A variety of narrative and expository structures should beprovided. Commercially prepared, teacher-authored, andstudent-authored materials should also be included. Readinginstruction can take place through all kinds of computer-basedmaterials, not merely those designated specifically for that purpose.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to experiment with text increative ways to suit their purposes. When students reorganize a storyor an informational piece on the computer, they are employing andstrengthening what they know about the structure of texts.<BR><BR><LI> Computer instruction in reading should make use of content from awide range of subject areas.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to use the computer as a means ofapplying reading strategies to all areas of the curriculum. Programsrelated to science, social studies, and math require the use ofstrategies for reading comprehension.<BR><BR>Unless students are being helped to use what they know about readingcomprehension under these circumstances, they are not progressing ascompetent readers.<BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to use the computer in conjunctionwith other modes of instruction. The computer should not operate as aseparate and isolated means of learning. Its use should be integratedwith that of books and other learning materials. Students need tothink of the computer as one additional means of sharing andretrieving information and practicing skills in interesting andmeaningful ways.<BR><BR><LI> Computer instruction in reading should link reading and writing. <BR><BR>*Learners should have opportunities to create text with the computerfor sharing and use by others. When students enter information intothe computer for someone else to retrieve and use, they must composewith the reader in mind. This frequently involves making explicit useof what they know about what makes a text comprehensible. Revision andproofreading strategies clearly involve the combined application orreading and writing skills.<BR><BR></OL><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="References"></a><H3>References</H3><P>Balajthy, Ernest (1987).

Curious George and the New Food Label

Curious George is always curious about food!  He has lots to tell boys 
and girls--and their families--about the new food label.<BR><BR> 

Read some labels with George.  And have fun as you learn about them 
together.<BR><BR>

Curious George doesn't monkey around with food!<BR><BR>

	Curious George always looks before he eats<BR>
	Breakfast, lunch, or tasty treats<BR><BR>

	Before it hits the table,<BR>
	He checks out the food label...<BR><BR>

	That food info label!<BR><BR>


Curious George is a smart monkey!  Labels help him learn about foods he 
eats.  Even his favorite foods have labels.  Your favorites do, too.<BR><BR>

From milk to marshmallows, labels tell about nutrients in all kinds of 
foods.  Curious George wants you to know about nutrients you see on food 
labels.<BR><BR>  

Look at the label for George's favorite treat--<B>Banana Munchie Crunchies.</B><BR><BR>

To stay healthy Curious George needs the right mix of these nutrients 
from foods during the day.  So do you!<BR><BR>

That's why George checks out food labels.  Then he picks foods for 
breakfast, lunch and his favorite treats.<BR><BR>

Like Curious George, read it before you eat it.<BR><BR>

	George reads the package sides and backs
	To find a food's Nutrition Facts.<BR><BR>

He sees the serving size,<BR>
	Then checks on nutrients inside...<BR><BR>      
	That food info label!<BR><BR>


Food labels give George the facts about the servings, calories and 
nutrients in food.  All the Nutrition Facts are just for one serving.<BR><BR>

That's how much energy Banana Munchie Crunchies gives.  If you're <B>seven 
to ten years old, you need about 2000 calories each day.</B><BR><BR>

Figure it out.  <B>How many calories do two servings have?</B><BR><BR>

<hr>

<B>Circle the % Daily Value on the label.</B>  The symbol % means percent, or 
part of the whole.  The % Daily Value column makes it easy to see if a 
food has a lot or a little of different nutrients such as fat or 
calcium.<BR><BR>

Here's how.  If the number in this column is 50% it would mean that one 
serving would be half the amount of fat for one day.  That's a lot.  For 
Banana Munchie Crunchies, the % Daily Value for fat is 5--that's a 
little.<BR><BR>

<hr>

Look at the percent column of the food label.  <B>In one serving how much 
of the following nutrients can you find?</B><BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>Fiber
<LI>Vitamin A
<LI>Iron
<LI>Calcium
<li>Fat
</UL>

<B>To learn about percents,</B> George took bites from a slice of bread.  The 
whole slice is 100%.  The small bite is 10%, or part, or the whole 
slice.  The bite that is 25% is bigger!<BR><BR>

<hr>

<B>Go label hunting </B>with Curious George.  Follow the maze in the 
Monkeyville Food Store to find him.  Look at the food labels along the 
way.<BR><BR>

Be like Curious George.  Go on a label hunt in the supermarket with 
someone in your family.<BR><BR>

In each part of the store, check food packages from top to bottom and 
side to side.  Find food labels with nutrition facts.<BR><BR> 

Look for nutrition facts on signs where fresh fruits, vegetables, meat 
and fish are sold, too.

What foods did you find in the store with nutrition facts?<BR><BR>

<hr>

Read the labels at the kitchen table!<BR><BR>

	
Now join George for some label fun<BR>
	With foods you find in your kitchen.<BR><BR>

	For favorites on your table,<BR>
	Read what's on the label...<BR><BR>
	That food info label!<BR><BR>


By reading food labels you see that foods aren't the same.  They have 
more of some nutrients and less of others.<BR><BR>

Hunt for food labels like Curious George does!<BR><BR>


	George finds food labels in the store<BR>
	On boxes, cans and jars galore.<BR><BR>

	Near fresh fruits, veggies, meats,<BR>
	The signs give facts on foods he eats...<BR>

<h3> <a name="Introduction">Introduction </a></h3>

<p>Brian is a 14-year-old who is repeating the seventh grade. Art is his
favorite and best subject. In other subjects, he struggles to maintain a
C average. His teachers comment about his lack of organization, his
difficulty following directions, and his 'class clown' behavior. He never
seems to quite fit in with the crowd. His level of frustration is rising
along with his truancy rate. Many things may be contributing to Brian's
difficulties, including a possible language disorder.<p>

<h3> <a name="Language Skills">Language Skills</a></h3>
<p>
<p>The ability to read and write is strongly influenced by the ability to
understand and use language. Students who are good listeners and speakers
tend to become strong readers and writers. Language has a major role in
all subjects including reading, math, history, geography, and even art.
The early school years emphasize language development, sociaI-emotional
growth and readiness skills. The middle grades emphasize specific
subjects. Mastery of language is assumed. Emphasis is placed on written
skills. The later grades involve more complex use of language by
students, including an increased vocabulary, more advanced sentence
structure, and different kinds of language for different situations.<p>

<p>The importance of early identification and remediation of language delays
or disorders in young children is well known. Less commonly known is the
importance of identifying and remediating language disorders in the
adolescent. Such disorders may lead to feelings of failure, low
self-esteem, poor academic and social success, and a high drop out rate.<p>

<p>
<li><STRONG>semantics (meaning)</STRONG>,
for    example, difficulty  understanding idioms: "It's  raining cats and dogs."
<p>
<li><STRONG>pragmatics (function)</STRONG>,
for  example, using language for  different purposes (promising,
requesting),  changing language for  listener needs (peer vs.teacher), or
following the rules of conversation (turn taking, introducing topics of
conversation, and staying on the topic).

<p>
<p>A student's understanding and use of language, hearing, thinking
abilities, emotional and social skills, desire to interact and
communicate with others, central and peripheral nervous system
functioning, and type of language models are assessed
in order to identify exactly any kind
of language disorder that exists and to rule out other causes of the
behaviors. The speech-language pathologist works closely with other
professionals, such as the school psychologist, to make these decisions.<p>

<p>     Intervention techniques may
focus on working to improve pragmatic skills and thinking skills. The
student will be taught strategies for learning new information and skills.<p>

<h3> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>The ability to pay attention is an important prerequisite to success in
school. Any difficulty with attending skills can have an adverse effect
on learning. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) refers to
the approximately 1 in every 20 (3-5%) of school-age children who have
significant difficulty with attention. Although the specific cause of
ADHD is still unknown, research has indicated the possibility of a
genetic or other prenatal cause.<p>

<p>The terms used to identify these children have changed as knowledge of
the.disorder has increased. In the past, terms such as minimal brain
damage or minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), learning disability (LI), or
hyperactive or hyperkinetic were used depending on the child's major area
of difficulty. Today, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is used to
recognize the important relationship between attending skills and the
ability to learn.<p>

<p>ADHD is the term used when the primary characteristic is significant
inattentiveness and impulsivity with or without hyperactivity. The child
often fails to finish projects, seems not to listen, is easily
distracted, and has difficulty concentrating even on a chosen task. Other
thoughts. sights, or sounds keep getting in the way, especially when the
task is difficult
or uninteresting. The child acts before thinking, switches from activity
to activity, needs a lot of supervision, and has difficulty with
organization of time, work, and belongings.<p>

<p>Hyperactivity often occurs with inattentiveness and impulsivity. The
child has difficulty sitting still, fidgets excessively, has difficulty
staying seated, and moves about excessively even during sleep. Onset
occurs before the age of 7 years. Behaviors are chronic (present
throughout the child's life), pervasive (present throughout the child's
day), and are not due to other factors such as anxiety or depression.<p>

<p>Attention deficit disorder
residual type (ADDRET) is sometimes used to indicate residual attention
deficit disorder (ADD) in older adolescents who were
previously identified as ADHD at a younger age but who no longer exhibit
hyperactivity. Approximately 50% of those with ADHD will mature out of
ADHD at puberty.<p>

<p>ADHD is present in children with average ability and in those who are
gifted. It affects boys and girls, but is more prevalent in boys. Most
often, these children appear restless and fidgety, but some children
appear lethargic, shy, and withdrawn. They may shout out answers in class
or respond reluctantly after prodding by the teacher. Work is often
incomplete and disorganized. At times, some children appear to be in
their own little world and are often falsely accused of not trying hard
enough, of being lazy, or of just not caring.
Social and emotional problems are common. They may be rejected by their
peers. Academic difficulties, behavioral problems, low, self-esteem,
aggressiveness, and, at times depression may occur.</p>

<h3> <a name="ADHD and Learning Disabilities">ADHD and Learning
Disabilities</a></h3>

<p>ADHD and learning disabilities frequently occur together, however, they
are not the same. Learning disabilities include difficulty with
receiving, organizing,
understanding, remembering, and offering information.  ADHD involves
difficulty with paying attention to information. Between 10 and 20% of
all school-aged children have learning disabilities. of those with LD,
about 20 to 25% will also have ADHD.<p>

<h3> <a name="Identification">Identification</a></h3>
<p>
<p>Behavioral problems, poor
school work, and learning difficulties may be the first indicators of a
need for evaluation. Diagnosis is based on the history of the problem or
behavior, and whether it is chronic and pervasive. A complete evaluation
includes a
team review of the child's medical, psychological, educational, and
behavioral strengths and areas of difficulty by audiologists,
speech-language pathologists, pediatricians, psychologists. special
educators, psychiatrists, and neurologists.<p>
<p>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<h3> <a name="Treatment">Treatment</a></h3>
<p>
 <p>Audiologists and speech -language pathologists are specialists in human
communication.
An audiologist should be consulted to measure hearing ability, evaluate
auditory skills, identify the presence and severity of any problem, and
provide appropriate recommendations. A speech- language pathologist
should be consulted to evaluate speech and language skills, identify
areas of strength and weakness in communication, and provide appropriate
recommendations and treatment, if indicated.<p>

<p>Medication (such as Toframil, Desipramine, Catapress, Tegretol,
Dexedrine, Ritalin, and Cylert) may be prescribed to control or treat
symptoms by a physician who is familiar with ADHD.<p>

<p>Educational interventions such
as accommodations within the regular education classroom (for example,
preferential seating in the classroom and elimination of distraction),
compensatory educational instruction (for example, repeating and
simplifying instructions, tutoring,  and use of a daily assignment
notebook), or placement in special education programs may be suggested.<p>

<p>Family and/or individual treatment may help to deal with aggression,
frustration, and disappointment, and feelings of failure in getting along
with family, school personnel, and peers.<p>

<p>Previous treatment approaches including food-additive-free diet,
elimination of sugar and megavitamin treatment have been found to be of
little value.<p>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What Is Attention  Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?</H3>

<blockquote>
<P>ADHD is a disorder characterized by three behaviors:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
 	<LI>HYPERACTIVITY
 	<LI>DISTRACTIBILITY 
 	<LI>IMPULSIVITY 
</UL>

<P>You may see one or more of these behaviors. It is not necessary to have all three to have ADHD: e.g., one does not have to be hyperactive.</P>

<P>ADHD is related, to but different than, learning disabilities (LD). Some people only have learning disabilities. Some have ADHD only. Some have both. A number of professionals  believe that as many as 50%-80% of those with ADHD will have LD. There is an overlap. It is important to remember each disorder requires different treatment.</P>

<a name="Are"></a>
<H3>What Are These Three Behaviors?</H3>

<blockquote>
<P><B>Hyperactivity:</B> The child exhibits an unusual degree of activity. Most are fidgety;
something is always in motion - fingers, pencil, feet. They squirm in their seat, or cannot remain seated, etc. </P>

<P><B>Distractibility:</B> The child has difficulty blocking out unnecessary input from the environment.</P>

<P><B>Auditorily  Distractible </B></P>

<P>Means paying attention to all sounds, not just appropriate ones, e.g., voices in  halls, ringing of
telephone.</P>

</blockquote>

<P><B>Visually  Distractible </B></P>
<blockquote>
<P>Means paying attention to all things seen rather than the appropriate items, e.g., clouds, rug,
pictures. </P>

<P><B>Impulsivity:</B> The child does not think before acting or talking and does not consider the impact of his/her actions on others. Thus, they do not learn from experience. This child may be accident prone because of impulsive behavior combined with poor judgment. </P>

</blockquote>

<hr>

<a name="The"></a>
<H3>Who Makes The Diagnosis?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Parents, teachers, and professionals may find evidence suggesting ADHD. However a physician usually confirms the diagnosis.</P>
</blockquote>
<H3>How Is The Diagnosis Made?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>ADHD is the least common reason for hyperactivity, distractibility or impulsivity. The most common causes for these behaviors are anxiety or depression.</P>

<P>The history of the problem is the best indication. If the behaviors have been chronic, that is, present almost since birth, and pervasive, present all day, every day, it is probably ADHD.</P>

<P>Check list and rating scales can be of assistance. However, the history of the behavior combined with clinical observations remain the best procedure for establishing the diagnosis of ADHD. </P>

<a name="Causes"></a>
<H3>What Causes ADHD?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>The final answer is not known. Current research strongly suggests that ADHD is due to a deficiency in a specific neurotransmitter in the lower area of the brain. Research should lead to a greater understanding of this disorder in coming years.</P>
</blockquote>

<H3>How Long Does It Last?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Current information suggests about 50% of children with ADHD will no longer have ADHD by puberty. The  remainder will continue into adolescence and possibly into adulthood.</P>
</blockquote>

<H3>How Is ADHD Treated?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Behavioral approaches can be attempted to help the child concentrate on sitting still, staying on task or thinking before acting. Most of these are effective for short periods of time. </P>

<P>Several nutritional approaches have been proposed. The Feingold Diet appears to work at best for 1-2% of children with ADHD. Too much refined sugar can increase hyperactivity in some children.</P>

<P>The generally accepted treatment in this country is the use of medications.</P>
</blockquote>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Treatment"></a>
<H3>Treatment With Medication:</H3>
<blockquote>
Each medication has its own characteristics, effects and possible side effects. Thus, the physician should review these issues with the parents before beginning any medication. The goal is to decrease or stop the behavior without side effects.

<P>Medications have been used since 1937 and are considered to be safe and effective. These medications do not "drug" or "alter the mind" of the child.  Rather, research suggests that each medication increases the amount of the chemical that is deficient in the brain, allowing the brain to function normally; therefore, the behaviors are diminished. Thus, the child becomes less active, less distractible and more able to think before acting.</P>

<P>The current approach is to use one of three groups of medications. The physician will generally begin with Group One progressing to the others if no improvement is seen or side effects occur.</P>

<P>Since ADHD can interfere with classroom work, peer interactions and family life, it is  recommended that the child be on medication throughout each day, not just during school hours.</P>

<H4>Group One medications are:</H4>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Ritalin (methylpenidate)

	<LI>Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)

	<LI>Cylert (pemoline)	 
</UL>

<H4> Group Two medications are </H4>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Tofranil (imipramine)

	<LI>Noripane (desipramine)
</UL>

 <H4>Group Three medications are:</H4>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
 	<LI>Mellaril (thioridazine)	 

 	<LI>Tegretol (carbamazepine)	 
</UL>


<P>Clonidine may be used with Group One or Two  medications to increase their effectiveness.</P>

<a name="Remember"></a>
 <H3>Remember The Total Child: </H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Many children with ADHD also have learning  disabilities. Treating the ADHD will not treat the learning disabilities. Each must be treated if the child is to make sufficient progress.</P>

<P>If children have ADHD and learning disabilities they may develop emotional, social and family  problems. Each must be recognized and helped. Unless the total child, in his or her total environment is considered, neither the child nor the family will make as much improvement as necessary.</P>

<p>HEATH provides the following as a service to readers who write 
papers, present conference sessions, apply for funds, address public 
policy makers, and otherwise need to "make a case" concerning the 
education after high school of students with disabilities.  You may 
quote exactly what is stated here and cite the sources as noted under 
the facts, or obtain the sources and select the statistics you need.  
Readers are welcome to call HEATH and talk about these data to 
Rhona Hartman or Laura Samberg. </p>

<a name="College"></a>
<H3>College Freshmen with Disabilities</H3>

<ul>
<li>The percentage of first-time, full-time freshmen reporting 
disabilities has increased significantly since the later 1970s.  In 1991, 
8.8 percent of all freshmen reported having some types of disability, 
compared with 2.6 percent in 1978.

<li>Sight and learning disabilities were identified most frequently 
by freshmen with disabilities in 1991, with about 25 percent 
reporting each type.  (Chart not available in on-line version)

<li>The proportion of freshmen with disabilities citing learning 
disabilities increased from 15 percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 1991.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to be male and 
older than non-disabled students.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities expected to take longer than the 
normal time to complete their degrees and were more likely to select 
a college based on its special program offerings.

<li>Women were more likely than men to have sight and health-related disabilities and need math and science tutoring.

<li>Freshmen with orthopedic disabilities tended to be older than 
other disabled students and more likely to have finished high school 
some years before entering college or to have passed the GED exam.

<li>Freshmen with learning disabilities were most likely to be 
enrolled in two-year campuses (59 percent), while another two-fifths 
(40 percent) were enrolled at universities and four-year colleges.  
One percent were enrolled at historically black colleges and 
universities.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities who were enrolled in historically 
black colleges and universities were more likely to report being blind 
or partially sighted, or having a health related disability.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to come from 
lower-income families and less likely to have received financial 
assistance from their families than non-disabled students.  In 
addition, disabled freshmen were less likely to contribute savings  
from summer work the previous summer.  Both disabled and non-
disabled received help from federal financial aid programs, private 
grants, and institutionally financed college loans.

<li>Across most major fields of study, disabled and other students 
expressed similar expectations.  Where they differed: students with 
disabilities were more interested in technical fields than their non-
disabled peers and less interested in being business majors.

<a name="Basis"></a>
<H3>Basis of exit for high school students, 1989-90</H3>

<ul>
<li>Over 220,000 students with disabilities left the special 
education system in 1989-90.

<li>More than four in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a diploma.

<li>More than one in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a certificate.

<li>One quarter of the students with disabilities, age 14 or older, 
dropped out of high school before completion.

<li>Students with specific learning disabilities represent the 
largest (129,000) number of the "exiting" population.  Slightly more 
than half of them (52%) were reported to have earned diplomas.  
Other groups in which more than half of the departing students 
obtained diplomas were those with visual impairment (61%), deaf-
blindness (61%), hearing impairment (59%), and orthopedic 
impairment (58%)

<a name="National"></a>
<H3>National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education 
Students</H3>

<p>The following data are taken from the National Longitudinal 
Transition Study of Special Education Students, conducted by SRI 
International under contract with the Office of Special Education 
Programs within the U.S. Department of Education.  The SRI data are 
based on a sample of over 8,000 special education students aged 13 
to 23 between the years 1987 to 1989.  Data was first collected in 
1987 from parent interviews, contacts with educators, and 
information from the students' school records.  Data collection was 
repeated in 1990 to track changes in experiences over time.  The 
data below highlight some of the changes in the area of participation 
in postsecondary education. </p>

<H4>Postsecondary education participation </H4>

<ul>
<li>Within the first two years after exiting high school, 15% of students 
with disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 27% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li> Comparatively, two years after leaving school, 56% of students 
without disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 68% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li>Thus, many disabled and non-disabled students alike who did not 
enroll in postsecondary education immediately after high school, do 
attend at a future date.  For both students with and without 
disabilities, enrollment rates are 12% higher three to five years after 
high school than they were two years after high school.  Students 
with disabilities are almost twice as likely to enroll in postsecondary 
education three to five years after high school as they are two years 
after high school.  However, there is still a gap in enrollment rates 
between students with disabilities and students without disabilities; 
at both time intervals, students with disabilities enroll in 
postsecondary education at significantly lower rates than do students 
without disabilities.
</ul>

<H4>Enrollment trends by disability category</H4>

<ul>
<li>Among the different disability categories, there is a great deal of 
variation in postsecondary education participation rates.  

<li>Two years after leaving high school, the participation rates for 
students who are deaf were the highest (36.4); the next largest rates 
were for students with speech impairments (34.0); and students with 
visual impairments (33.0).

<li>Three to five years after leaving high school, the participation rates 
in postsecondary education were the highest for students who are 
hard of hearing (60.4); the next highest rates were for students who 
are deaf (60.0); and students with visual impairments (57.0).

<li>Of all students with disabilities, students with sensory impairments 
attend postsecondary education at rates most similar to students 
without disabilities.

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) today released the results of a
report indicating that public playground equipment could have chipping and peeling lead paint, which is a potential
lead poisoning hazard primarily for children six years old and younger. </P>

<P>Children six years old and younger could ingest lead by getting paint chips or dust on their hands and then putting
their hands in their mouths. Older children and adults are less likely to be at risk because they generally do not
exhibit this same behavior. </P>

<P>CPSC tested and analyzed paint from 26 playgrounds in 13 cities. Of those, 16 playgrounds in 11 cities had levels
of lead found in the paint on playground equipment that are high enough to be recognized as a federal priority for
lead hazard control measures.</P>

<P>In addition to collecting its own data, CPSC also received reports from local communities of lead paint on 125
playgrounds in 11 additional cities. Several of these cities have already begun addressing the lead paint hazard from
their playgrounds.</P>

<P>While deteriorating lead paint in homes is the leading cause of lead poisoning in children, the effects of ingesting
lead are cumulative. Therefore, exposure to lead paint from playground equipment can contribute to the lead
poisoning hazard. </P>

<P>CPSC does not consider playground equipment with lead paint that is intact and in good condition a hazard.
However, paint will deteriorate from exposure to sunlight, heat, moisture, and normal wear and tear to form chips
and dust. If that paint contains lead, it does present a hazard once it deteriorates. </P>

<P>The 1992 Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act sets 0.5 percent lead by weight as the level of lead in
paint that should be targeted for lead hazard control. In accordance with this law, CPSC is recommending that local
and state jurisdictions give high priority to controlling the lead paint hazard from playground equipment with
chipping and peeling paint containing lead at or above the 0.5 percent level.</P>

<P>Lead poisoning in children is associated with behavioral problems, learning disabilities, hearing problems, and
stunted growth. CPSC found that in some of the paint chips from playground equipment, the levels of lead were
high enough that a child ingesting a paint chip one-tenth of a square inch -- about the size that could fit on the tip of
a pencil eraser -- each day for about 15 to 30 days could have blood lead levels at or above the 10 microgram per
deciliter amount considered dangerous for children especially those six years old and younger. </P>

<P>In addition to its investigation of older playground equipment, CPSC is testing the paint on recently manufactured
equipment. CPSC is making sure that these products are in compliance with the agency's requirements for painted
playground equipment. </P>

<P>In the report released today, CPSC is providing information for cities and states to use in addressing the lead hazard
on playground equipment on a case-by-case basis.</P>

<P>CPSC recommends that individual cities take measures to address the lead hazard in playgrounds based on a variety
of factors. These factors include: condition of the paint; percent of lead in the paint; age of the playground
equipment; location, use and overall safety of the equipment; the financial resources available to address this and
other lead paint hazards; the relative costs of control measures; and regulatory requirements pertinent to the local or
state jurisdictions. </P>

<P>If states, cities, or local communities suspect they may have playground equipment painted with lead paint, CPSC
recommends they test the equipment using an accredited laboratory. CPSC does not recommend using lead test kits
on playground equipment since CPSC, HUD, and EPA have found these test kits unreliable.</P>

<P>Parents concerned about this hazard can look for deteriorating paint on playground equipment. If they find
deteriorating paint, they should contact the playground's owner or local officials and ask them to test the paint.
Parents should also make sure that children do not put their hands in their mouths while playing on equipment with
deteriorating paint and wash their hands thoroughly afterward. </P>

<P>If your child's playground is found to have high levels of lead, community, city, state, or school officials should
take appropriate control measures. Parents who are concerned about whether their child has lead poisoning should
consult with the child's physician. CPSC has no reports of children with lead poisoning from paint on playground
equipment. </P>

<P>For questions about lead on playground equipment that are not about the status of individual playgrounds,
consumers can call CPSC's toll-free hotline at (800) 638-2772 Ext.274. To order this information from CPSC's
fax-on-demand system, call (301) 504-0051 from the handset of a fax machine, and press 6005 when prompted to
enter a document number. </P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000 types of
consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury and for information on
CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To order a press
release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release number. Consumers can
obtain this release and recall information via Internet gopher services at <A HREF="gopher://cpsc.gov">cpsc.gov</A> or report product hazards to <a href="mailto:info@cpsc.gov">info@cpsc.gov</a> </P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) warns that
inline roller skating--a popular new sport--can be hazardous if
skaters do not wear helmets and other protective equipment or do
not learn to skate and stop safely. As use of in-line roller
skates has increased, it appears that the number of injuries also
has increased.</P>

<P>CPSC recommends these safety tips to help prevent injuries with
inline roller skates:</P>
<p>
<ul>

<li> Wear a helmet, intended for use with skateboards or roller
skates, along with knee pads, elbow pads, and gloves. <br><br>

<li>Skate on smooth, paved surfaces without any traffic. Avoid
skating on streets, driveways, or surfaces with water, sand,
gravel, or dirt.<br><br>

<li> Learn to stop safely using the brake pads at the heel of most
inline roller skates. With one foot somewhat in front of the
other, raise the toes of the front foot and push, down on the
heel brake.
<br><br>
<li> Do not skate at night because of your difficulty in being seen
and your difficulty seeing obstacles or other skaters.

<P>     Kids all across the country have opinions about bike
helmets.  Some kids wear them.  Others don't.  And many kids have
ideas on how to get others to wear bike helmets more often.</P>

<P>     We asked 282 kids, ages 8 to 13, from schools in
Pennsylvania, Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Mexico, New York,
Nebraska, and Washington, just what they thought about bike
helmets.</P>

<P>Look what they had to say!</P>

<a name="Crash"></a>
<H3>What Could Happen If You Were Had a Bike Crash and
Weren't Wearing a Helmet?</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>"You could be paralyzed, killed, or you could suffer damage."
	<LI>"You could bust your head open on the sidewalk or a rock."
	<LI>"You could go into a coma."
	<LI>"You could break your neck or crack your head."
	<LI>"You could have serious brain damage and you might have to
	     learn all you know over again."
</UL>

<H4>FACTS</H4>

<P>     You may think you're a pretty good biker, but crashes happen
all the time to very good riders.  In fact:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    Wearing a bike helmet is the single most important thing you
     can do to protect your brain - and your life - when you ride
     your bike.
     
<LI>    Children between ages 5 and 14 have the highest rate of
     injury of all bicycle riders.
     
<LI>    Each year, more than 500,000 children go to hospital
     emergency rooms or doctors' offices due to bicycle injuries.
     
<LI>    More than half of these collisions happen on neighborhood
     streets, sidewalks, or playgrounds.
</UL>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a>

<a name="Wearing"></a>
<H3>Why Do You Wear a Bike Helmet?</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    "I wear a helmet because I had an accident and I was wearing
     a helmet and my head felt fine."
<LI>    "Because it looks cool and it keeps my head safe."
<LI>    "Because I don't want to hurt my head like my cousin (who
    almost died in a bike accident)."
<LI>    "I wear my helmet most of the time because there is law
     about helmets."
<LI>    "I wear my helmet all the time because 1) my parents make me
     and 2) I don't want to get any head injuries."
<LI>    "You should always wear them because they keep you and your
     brain safe."
</UL>

<H4>FACTS</H4>
<P>     Nationally, only about 15 percent of all kids wear bike
helmets.  In this AAA survey of school children, here's how often
kids wore bike helmets:</P>

</TABLE>


<P>     Helmet usage of the surveyed kids is better than the
national average.  Even so, more than half of the children
surveyed don't wear bike helmets most of the time.  This means
lots of these kids could be injured riding bikes.</P>

<H3>What Would Get Your Best Find to Wear a Bike Helmet More Often?</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>    "You could make a commercial with a famous person wearing a
     helmet and kids could use them as role modes."
<LI>    "Put baseball, football and race driver numbers and names on
     helmets.
<LI>    "Show pros wearing helmets and being cool."
<LI>    "Put extra padding inside of it to make it more
     comfortable."
<LI>    "Put little compartments on the helmets"
<LI>    "Make helmets for girls with ponytails."
<LI>    "You could have a bike-a-thon to encourage kids to wear
     helmets."
<LI>    "If you wear one, you get a free pizza.
<LI>    "Tell them it's the law and if they don't they will have to
     eat spinach."
<LI>    "Have kids who wouldn't wear helmets and got in serious
     collisions go and talk to other kids who won't wear

<a name="Save"></a>
<H3>What You Can Do To Help Save Lives</H3>

<UL TYPE=DIS>
<LI>    Always wear your bike helmet - and make sure your brothers
     and sisters do, too.
<LI>    Make a deal with your best friend to always wear your
     helmets when you ride together.
<LI>    Talk to your parents or teachers to help organize projects
     with your school, safety patrol, Scout troop, religious
     organization, or other group that will encourage kids to
     wear bike helmets.
<LI>    Ask local businesses to sell bikes only with bike helmets or
     set up bike-helmet giveaway or discount-coupon programs.
</UL>
                               

<P>Ten tips for safe bike riding:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>Always wear a bike helmet.
	<LI>Stop and check traffic before riding into a street.
	<LI>Don't ride at night.
	<LI>Obey traffic signs and signals.
	<LI>Ride on the right-hand side of the street.
	<LI>Check your brakes before riding.
	<LI>Give cars and pedestrians the right-of-way.
	<LI>Wear light or bright-colored clothing so that motorists can
	     see you.
	<LI>Be extra careful turning left - motorists don't expect it.
	<LI>Avoid broken pavement, loose gravel and leaves - which can
     cause you to lose control of your bike.

<b> The EDUNET and The Alif laila Children's Educational Complex </b>
<br>
Hi!
Following is an introduction of our special educational programs in pakistan. This is to request you for help in finding corporations / sponsors who could donate old computer equipment to us. I am representing my organization and am currently in the united states.... will be here for another 10 days or so.... within this period, I would take care of the shipping completely, any donations that may materialise after this can be collected somewhere in SFransisco and then we would arrange to have them shipped.
<br>
As you will read in the following introduction, our program is completely dependent on donations / grants... and this particular project, i.e EDUNET, requires as many computers as it can get for installation in schools.
<br>
<br>
The EDUNET (Educational Computer Resource Network), is run by the Education Support Trust, a non-governmental, non-profit organization working for the educational uplift of the lower income group children in Pakistan.
<br>
Since public schools in most third world countries are extremely short on resources, it is hard to come across good quality primary and secondary education in these schools. Teachers are overworked, students suffer from a lack of motivation and eventually end up dropping out..... it is in this manner that generations have been deprived of the enlightenment that comes from education....
<br>
<br>
The Education Support Trust and it's sister organization, The Alif laila, have been working to promote libraries, project based learning, improved syllabi development and audio visual facilities for children for the last 18 years. We now run two libraries, a project based learning centre where children are taught computers, mechanics, electronics, aeronautics, woodwork, puppetry, arts and craft and photography... and several small home schools for children coming from financially destitute families, often children of drug-addicted parents. In a year's time, we would have expanded to other cities of the country also... Presently, we cater to about 4,000 children in the libraries, 600 in the schools and about 1,800 children at the project based learning centre... Everything we provide for children is absolutely free of cost.
<br>
<br>
Though these figures may seem large, they are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the total population of school going children in Pakistan. Infact, it is impossible for us to cater to even a significant portion of those children, because of lack of funds. Since we are a non-profit organization, our work depends completely on donations. 
<br>
<br>
Realizing this, we have initiated the EDUNET project. To widen our reach to schools everywhere in the country, we have centralised all the research, the educational resource materials, syllabi, new ways to teach, project based learning activities, ready made and oft revised class lectures etc... and put them into a central computer system so that they can be accessed by children and teachers. The ready made lessons ensure a minumum quality in the educational system and they also reduce the workload on the teacher... similarily, our research team can be contacted through the EDUNET and children can get help on their school projects and assignments. In short, we have attempted to revamp the entire educational structure of our country with the minimum cost overheads. 
<br>
<br>
Now, all that schools need to access the EDUNET is a <b> computer and a modem </B>. Nothing fancy, mind you, even an old 286 machine would do, since all that it will be used for is connecting to our online service and downloading material from there. We will install the machines in schools, provide free training, maintenance and technical support to them. However, we are unfortunately not in a position to provide computers, and it is for this reason that we seek your aid. If you have any old computer equipment or any books that you do not need anymore, please let us know so that public schools can use them to gain access to a wealth of educational resources.
<br>
<br>
I have been sent to the US by the Alif laila and the Education Support Trust to ask you friends for your help. I will be in the United states for another 2 weeks, and within this period, can take care of the shipping and transportation of the donated equipment. 
<br>
Looking forward to your early replies,
<br>
best regards, Amir Husain.

<h2> Early Ways To  Predict Poor Readers</h2>

<H3>Children who read well tend to do well in school.</H3> 
<p>Those
who have trouble  reading, unless helped, generally have trouble with
school. But typically, parents must wait for low grades or notes from the
teacher to find out if their child is having trouble reading.<p>

<p>Now, new research from Boston University and Emerson College in Boston
suggests that a child's performance on certain language tasks may predict
later reading problems. This is true even when these children do not show
clear signs of language difficulties in daily life, say the researchers.<p>

 <p>    "Children who have trouble reading often have underlying
speech and language problems," says Paula Menyuk, professor of
developmental studies and applied linguistics at Boston University.<p>

<p>One hundred eighty children were tested three times between the ages of
1/2 and 7 1/2. The tests examined the children's performance at different
levels of language: sounds, words, sentences, and discourse. Then, when the
children reached first or second grade, they were tested for oral language,
reading, mathematics, and spelling abilities.<p>

<p>In the study, 48 children turned out to have reading problems. The
language tasks used by the Boston researchers in the first part of the
study identified 36 of these children.<p>

<p>Poor performance on three language tasks was an especially good
predictor of later reading problems:<p>

<ul>
<li> <STRONG>understanding complex sentences</STRONG>, such as "The boy who
kissed the girl ran away."
<p>
<li><STRONG>selecting missing words in sentences</STRONG>, such as "The
girls decorated the ______tree." (Christmas, big, bare)
<p>
<li> <STRONG>retrieving words rapidly</STRONG>, for example, quickly naming
a series of 36 unrelated pictures.
</ul>
<p> Some of the children who had reading problems had nothing remarkable in
their developmental histories except very low birthweight (under 1500
grams). Jacqueline Liebergott, professor of communication disorders at
Emerson, speculated that these early medical difficulties may have had an
effect on language development that was not apparent until the children
started to learn to read.<p>

<p>Being able to predict which children will have trouble reading would
allow speech-language pathologists and others to begin to work with them
before they fail, says Menvuk.<p>

<h2> <a name="Introduction">Introduction </a></h2>

<p>Brian is a 14-year-old who is repeating the seventh grade. Art is his
favorite and best subject. In other subjects, he struggles to maintain a
C average. His teachers comment about his lack of organization, his
difficulty following directions, and his 'class clown' behavior. He never
seems to quite fit in with the crowd. His level of frustration is rising
along with his truancy rate. Many things may be contributing to Brian's
difficulties, including a possible language disorder.<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Language Skills">Language Skills </a></h2>
<p>
<p>The ability to read and write is strongly influenced by the ability to
understand and use language. Students who are good listeners and speakers
tend to become strong readers and writers. Language has a major role in
all subjects including reading, math, history, geography, and even art.
The early school years emphasize language development, sociaI-emotional
growth and readiness skills. The middle grades emphasize specific
subjects. Mastery of language is assumed. Emphasis is placed on written
skills. The later grades involve more complex use of language by
students, including an increased vocabulary, more advanced sentence
structure, and different kinds of language for different situations.<p>

<p>The importance of early identification and remediation of language delays
or disorders in young children is well known. Less commonly known is the
importance of identifying and remediating language disorders in the
adolescent. Such disorders may lead to feelings of failure, low
self-esteem, poor academic and social success, and a high drop out rate.<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Language Disorders">Language Disorders</a></h2>
<p>
<p>Language disorder refers to any impairment in
<ol>
<li><STRONG>form</STRONG>
including phonology, morphology, and syntax, for  example, misuse or
misunderstanding of the information provided by  word endings: "The
boy eat his dinner."
<p>
<li><STRONG>semantics (meaning)</STRONG>,
for    example, difficulty  understanding idioms: "It's  raining cats and dogs."
<p>
<li><STRONG>pragmatics (function)</STRONG>,
for  example, using language for  different purposes (promising,
requesting),  changing language for  listener needs (peer vs.teacher), or
following the rules of conversation (turn taking, introducing topics of
conversation, and staying on the topic).
</ol>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Adolescents With Language Disorder">Adolescents With Language
Disorder</a></h2>
<p>
 Adolescents identified with
language disorders include:
<ol>     <li>those initially identified      through early intervention
programs. Although they      have received treatment and      treatment
may have reduced      the severity of the problem,      some language
difficulties      persist;
<p>
    <li>those who received no      intervention;
<p>
    <li>those who had normal      language development but
experienced a disruption      because of some physical,      emotional,
or traumatic      event; and
<p>
    <li>those who have been      identified as having a      learning
disability.
</ol>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Evaluation">Evaluation</a></h2>
<p>
<p>A student's understanding and use of language, hearing, thinking
abilities, emotional and social skills, desire to interact and
communicate with others, central and peripheral nervous system
functioning, and type of language models are assessed
in order to identify exactly any kind
of language disorder that exists and to rule out other causes of the
behaviors. The speech-language pathologist works closely with other
professionals, such as the school psychologist, to make these decisions.<p>

<p>     Intervention techniques may
focus on working to improve pragmatic skills and thinking skills. The
student will be taught strategies for learning new information and skills.<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="What Can You Do">What Can You Do?</a></h2>
<p>
<p>If you recognize the
characteristic behaviors of language disorders in an adolescent or if you
have concerns, consult a speech- language pathologist. If you need a
referral, call the <STRONG>toll-free HELPLINE (1-800-638-8255) </STRONG>or
write to<p>

<h2> <a name="Introduction">Introduction </a> </h2>
<p>The ability to pay attention is an important prerequisite to success in
school. Any difficulty with attending skills can have an adverse effect
on learning. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) refers to
the approximately 1 in every 20 (3-5%) of school-age children who have
significant difficulty with attention. Although the specific cause of
ADHD is still unknown, research has indicated the possibility of a
genetic or other prenatal cause.<p>

<p>The terms used to identify these children have changed as knowledge of
the.disorder has increased. In the past, terms such as minimal brain
damage or minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), learning disability (LI), or
hyperactive or hyperkinetic were used depending on the child's major area
of difficulty. Today, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is used to
recognize the important relationship between attending skills and the
ability to learn.<p>

<p>ADHD is the term used when the primary characteristic is significant
inattentiveness and impulsivity with or without hyperactivity. The child
often fails to finish projects, seems not to listen, is easily
distracted, and has difficulty concentrating even on a chosen task. Other
thoughts. sights, or sounds keep getting in the way, especially when the
task is difficult
or uninteresting. The child acts before thinking, switches from activity
to activity, needs a lot of supervision, and has difficulty with
organization of time, work, and belongings.<p>

<p>Hyperactivity often occurs with inattentiveness and impulsivity. The
child has difficulty sitting still, fidgets excessively, has difficulty
staying seated, and moves about excessively even during sleep. Onset
occurs before the age of 7 years. Behaviors are chronic (present
throughout the child's life), pervasive (present throughout the child's
day), and are not due to other factors such as anxiety or depression.<p>

<p>Attention deficit disorder
residual type (ADDRET) is sometimes used to indicate residual attention
deficit disorder (ADD) in older adolescents who were
previously identified as ADHD at a younger age but who no longer exhibit
hyperactivity. Approximately 50% of those with ADHD will mature out of
ADHD at puberty.<p>

<p>ADHD is present in children with average ability and in those who are
gifted. It affects boys and girls, but is more prevalent in boys. Most
often, these children appear restless and fidgety, but some children
appear lethargic, shy, and withdrawn. They may shout out answers in class
or respond reluctantly after prodding by the teacher. Work is often
incomplete and disorganized. At times, some children appear to be in
their own little world and are often falsely accused of not trying hard
enough, of being lazy, or of just not caring.
Social and emotional problems are common. They may be rejected by their
peers. Academic difficulties, behavioral problems, low, self-esteem,
aggressiveness, and, at times depression may occur.<p>

<h2> <a name="ADHD and Learning Disabilities">ADHD and Learning
Disabilities </a> </h2>

<p>ADHD and learning disabilities frequently occur together, however, they
are not the same. Learning disabilities include difficulty with
receiving, organizing,
understanding, remembering, and offering information.  ADHD involves
difficulty with paying attention to information. Between 10 and 20% of
all school-aged children have learning disabilities. of those with LD,
about 20 to 25% will also have ADHD.<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Identification">Identification</a> </h2>
<p>
<p>Behavioral problems, poor
school work, and learning difficulties may be the first indicators of a
need for evaluation. Diagnosis is based on the history of the problem or
behavior, and whether it is chronic and pervasive. A complete evaluation
includes a
team review of the child's medical, psychological, educational, and
behavioral strengths and areas of difficulty by audiologists,
speech-language pathologists, pediatricians, psychologists. special
educators, psychiatrists, and neurologists.<p>
<p>
<h2> <a name="Treatment">Treatment</a> </h2>
<p>
 <p>Audiologists and speech -language pathologists are specialists in human
communication.
An audiologist should be consulted to measure hearing ability, evaluate
auditory skills, identify the presence and severity of any problem, and
provide appropriate recommendations. A speech- language pathologist
should be consulted to evaluate speech and language skills, identify
areas of strength and weakness in communication, and provide appropriate
recommendations and treatment, if indicated.<p>

<p>Medication (such as Toframil, Desipramine, Catapress, Tegretol,
Dexedrine, Ritalin, and Cylert) may be prescribed to control or treat
symptoms by a physician who is familiar with ADHD.<p>

<p>Educational interventions such
as accommodations within the regular education classroom (for example,
preferential seating in the classroom and elimination of distraction),
compensatory educational instruction (for example, repeating and
simplifying instructions, tutoring,  and use of a daily assignment
notebook), or placement in special education programs may be suggested.<p>

<p>Family and/or individual treatment may help to deal with aggression,
frustration, and disappointment, and feelings of failure in getting along
with family, school personnel, and peers.<p>

<p>Previous treatment approaches including food-additive-free diet,
elimination of sugar and megavitamin treatment have been found to be of
little value.<p>

<P>No parent likes to have to choose drug therapy for their child. As anxious as parents and teachers are to get children's behavior and learning on track, drug therapy has a major drawback -- it's not addressing the cause of the problem. Many experts believe there may be various causes. Until we know exactly what they are, looking at what triggers attention, behavior and learning problems is important. Parents all over the world have noted that certain environmental agents can trigger their children's symptoms. For many families, managing the symptoms lies in making some changes in diet.</P>

<P>How many children fit into this group? One double blind, placebo-controlled study of children with ADHD who also had signs of allergy showed that 73% responded favorably to treatment with a multiple-item elimination diet. (Boris and Mandel, Annals of Allergy, May 1994.)</P>

<P>If you think your child does not have allergies, consider that allergy can show up as ear infections, nasal symptoms, skin rashes, red ears or cheeks, puffiness or circles under the eyes, gastro-intestinal problems, asthma or frequent upper respiratory infections.</P>

<P>The Feingold Association can help determine if food chemicals and natural salicylates are a trigger of behavior, learning or attention problems. They are a world-wide, nonprofit organization, dedicated to helping people know if there is a connection for them or their child with symptoms of:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>ADD, ADHD,</B>
	<LI><B>Learning Disabilities and</B>
	<LI><B>PDD (Pervasive Developmental Delay) and Autism </B>
</UL>

<P>They also assist people in determining</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>sensitivities to natural salicylates (a relative of aspirin) </B>
</UL>
<P>and help people to make the transition to foods without certain chemicals.</P>

<P>The Feingold Programs has as its foundation an elimination diet developed by Ben F. Feingold, MD in the 1970's at Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco. Dr. Feingold, noted pediatrician and allergist, pioneered this work linking behavior, attention and learning problems in children to the ingestion of natural or synthetic chemicals.</P>

<P>The Feingold Program is the choosing of products and foods without synthetic (artificial) colors, synthetic (artificial) flavors, antioxidant preservatives BHA, BHT, &amp; TBHQ and, for a trial period, foods which contain natural salicylates (such as apples,oranges &amp; tomatoes) and aspirin and medication containing aspirin.</P>

<P>After a favorable response, the salicylate-containing foods and medications can be added back into the diet one at a time and any reactions noted.</P>

<P>Support groups of parents who saw a difference in their children sprang up around the world after his book <I>Why Your Child is Hyperactive</I> was published in 1975. These organizations exist today as the Feingold Associations of the United States.</P>

<H3>Who supports the diet-behavior connection?</H3>

<P>Published Research supports it:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>"Dietary factors may plan a significant role in the the etiology of the majority of children with ADHD", Boris and Mandel, Annals of Allergy, May 1994. "...the suggestion that diet may contribute to behavior disorders in children must be taken seriously." Egger, et al, Lancet, March 9, 1985.<BR><BR>

	<LI>"These results suggest that pediatricians and other practitioners might consider dietary modification worth trying, particularly in younger children." Kaplan et al, Journal of Pediatrics, 83 (January 1989), pp. 7-17.<BR><BR>

	<LI>"This study demonstrated a functional relation between the ingestion of a synthetic food color (tartrazine) and behavioral change..." Rowe and Rowe, Journal of Pediatrics, 125 (November 1994) pp. 691-8. <BR><BR>
	<LI>For a complete bibliography on ADD, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to the Feingold Association, Bibliography (indicates ADD or autism) 127 E. Main St., Riverhead, NY 11901<BR><BR>
</UL>

<P>Parents who have seen it work support it: </P>
<P>For over two decades families and thousands of people of all ages have been dramatically helped by this program. Many have been able to eliminate or reduce medication, including Ritalin and other amphetamine-like drugs.</P>

<P>The Feingold Program is made easier to use by the Feingold Association of the United States through the excellent materials it provides and the help it offers from families who are using it. Updates to the product lists are made through the newsletter which also reports on the breaking research in the areas of ADD, ADHD, autism and other developmental delays. The Programs are based on published research and the reported results in the homes of thousands of families.</P>

<P>Believed to be on the same continuum as ADD/ADHD are PDD (Pervasive Developmental Delay) and Autistic-like symptoms. The rates of diagnosed PDD and Autism are increasing an an alarming rate. For some, a metabolic connection has been found.</P>

<P>The Feingold Association's Autism, Intolerance and Allergy Program can help parents become "detectives" in tracking down biochemical connections to autistic-like behavior. They work with the leading doctors world wide involved in this cutting edge research. Many families report a decrease in symptoms when they follow the Autism, Intolerance and Allergy (AIA) Program. The following are symptoms that are addressed by the AIA Program. Please note: All children exhibit these at one time or another. It is the persistence and the intensity that are cause for concern. Check with your doctor.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Unaware of the world 
	<LI>Lack of eye contact 
	<LI>General learning disability 
	<LI>Difficulty relating to others 
	<LI>Hyperactivity 
	<LI>Withdrawn and miserable 
	<LI>Repetitive behavior/speech 
	<LI>Fixation on one object 
	<LI>Sleep problems 
	<LI>Obsessively spinning objects or self 
	<LI>Compulsively touching smooth objects 
	<LI>Fascination with lights 
	<LI>Arm flapping with excited 
	<LI>Jumping up and down 
	<LI>Walking on tiptoes 
	<LI>Giggling and/or screaming for no apparent reason 
	<LI>Eating strange substances (earth, sand, paper, toothpaste, etc.)
</UL>

<P>The Feingold Associations are supported almost entirely by memberships and donations from families for whom the Feingold Program offered help for their child. Contact them for free information at 1(800) 321-3287 or e-mail feingold@php.com.</P>

<P>IMPORTANT NOTES: If you have tried the Feingold Program on your own, you probably missed many hidden additives. Without the benefit of Feingold Association materials, including the most current, updated approved product list, you cannot be assured of the maximum response. Membership in the Feingold Association will provide you with the necessary materials, and a newsletter to keep them and you up to date. Members support is offered to help make the change and to customize the program to your individual needs. This information is not meant to replace medical evaluation. Behavior, attention or learning problems can be triggered by many factors. Parents need to document any triggers and work in partnership with their doctor.</P>

<p>HEATH provides the following as a service to readers who write 
papers, present conference sessions, apply for funds, address public 
policy makers, and otherwise need to "make a case" concerning the 
education after high school of students with disabilities.  You may

<H3>College Freshmen with Disabilities</H3>

<ul>
<li>The percentage of first-time, full-time freshmen reporting 
disabilities has increased significantly since the later 1970s.  In 1991, 
8.8 percent of all freshmen reported having some types of disability, 
compared with 2.6 percent in 1978.

<li>Sight and learning disabilities were identified most frequently 
by freshmen with disabilities in 1991, with about 25 percent 
reporting each type.  (Chart not available in on-line version)

<li>The proportion of freshmen with disabilities citing learning 
disabilities increased from 15 percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 1991.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to be male and 
older than non-disabled students.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities expected to take longer than the 
normal time to complete their degrees and were more likely to select 
a college based on its special program offerings.

<li>Women were more likely than men to have sight and health-related disabilities and need math and science tutoring.

<li>Freshmen with orthopedic disabilities tended to be older than 
other disabled students and more likely to have finished high school 
some years before entering college or to have passed the GED exam.

<li>Freshmen with learning disabilities were most likely to be 
enrolled in two-year campuses (59 percent), while another two-fifths 
(40 percent) were enrolled at universities and four-year colleges.  
One percent were enrolled at historically black colleges and 
universities.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities who were enrolled in historically 
black colleges and universities were more likely to report being blind 
or partially sighted, or having a health related disability.

<li>Freshmen with disabilities were more likely to come from 
lower-income families and less likely to have received financial 
assistance from their families than non-disabled students.  In 
addition, disabled freshmen were less likely to contribute savings  
from summer work the previous summer.  Both disabled and non-
disabled received help from federal financial aid programs, private 
grants, and institutionally financed college loans.

<li>Across most major fields of study, disabled and other students 
expressed similar expectations.  Where they differed: students with 
disabilities were more interested in technical fields than their non-
disabled peers and less interested in being business majors.

</ul>

<H3>Basis of exit for high school students, 1989-90</H3>

<ul>
<li>Over 220,000 students with disabilities left the special 
education system in 1989-90.

<li>More than four in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a diploma.

<li>More than one in ten students with disabilities, age 14 or 
older, graduated from high school with a certificate.

<li>One quarter of the students with disabilities, age 14 or older, 
dropped out of high school before completion.

<li>Students with specific learning disabilities represent the 
largest (129,000) number of the "exiting" population.  Slightly more 
than half of them (52%) were reported to have earned diplomas.  
Other groups in which more than half of the departing students 
obtained diplomas were those with visual impairment (61%), deaf-
blindness (61%), hearing impairment (59%), and orthopedic 
impairment (58%)

<H3>National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education 
Students</H3>

<p>The following data are taken from the National Longitudinal 
Transition Study of Special Education Students, conducted by SRI 
International under contract with the Office of Special Education 
Programs within the U.S. Department of Education.  The SRI data are 
based on a sample of over 8,000 special education students aged 13 
to 23 between the years 1987 to 1989.  Data was first collected in 
1987 from parent interviews, contacts with educators, and 
information from the students' school records.  Data collection was 
repeated in 1990 to track changes in experiences over time.  The 
data below highlight some of the changes in the area of participation 
in postsecondary education. </p>

<H4>Postsecondary education participation </H4>

<ul>
<li>Within the first two years after exiting high school, 15% of students 
with disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 27% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li> Comparatively, two years after leaving school, 56% of students 
without disabilities had attended postsecondary school during the 
preceding year; three to five years after leaving school, 68% of 
students with disabilities had ever attended postsecondary 
education.

<li>Thus, many disabled and non-disabled students alike who did not 
enroll in postsecondary education immediately after high school, do 
attend at a future date.  For both students with and without 
disabilities, enrollment rates are 12% higher three to five years after 
high school than they were two years after high school.  Students 
with disabilities are almost twice as likely to enroll in postsecondary 
education three to five years after high school as they are two years 
after high school.  However, there is still a gap in enrollment rates 
between students with disabilities and students without disabilities; 
at both time intervals, students with disabilities enroll in 
postsecondary education at significantly lower rates than do students 
without disabilities.
</ul>

<H4>Enrollment trends by disability category</H4>

<ul>
<li>Among the different disability categories, there is a great deal of 
variation in postsecondary education participation rates.  

<li>Two years after leaving high school, the participation rates for 
students who are deaf were the highest (36.4); the next largest rates 
were for students with speech impairments (34.0); and students with 
visual impairments (33.0).

<li>Three to five years after leaving high school, the participation rates 
in postsecondary education were the highest for students who are 
hard of hearing (60.4); the next highest rates were for students who 
are deaf (60.0); and students with visual impairments (57.0).

<li>Of all students with disabilities, students with sensory impairments 
attend postsecondary education at rates most similar to students 
without disabilities.
</ul>

<h2>Students with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)</h2>
<h3>Courtesy of <br>
<a href="/heath/index.html">HEATH Resource Center</a> </h3>
</center>
<p>
The HEATH Resource Center has recently received a number of requests for 
information on issues associated with postsecondary education for 
individuals with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  In order to collect 
information on this emerging topic, the HEATH staff contacted Chesapeake 
Psychological Services, one of several Washington, DC metropolitan area 
resources offering comprehensive testing and follow-up support to 
individuals with varying types of disabilities.  Chesapeake Psychological 
Services has an Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Clinic, which offers 
a full range of treatment services - from educational recommendations to 
consultation with physicians. As a result of that contact, Dr. Susan Biggs and 
Dr. Kathleen Nadeau on staff at Chesapeake Psychological Services accepted 
the invitation to present a professional development program to the 
members of  the Nation's Capital Area Disability Support Services Coalition.  
What follows is a summary of the Biggs-Nadeau presentation in December 
1992. </p>

<H3>Defining ADD</H3>
<p>
The basic characteristics of adults with ADD include inattention and 
impulsivity.  Adults with ADD may be disorganized, may lose things 
frequently, and may be easily distracted from the task-at-hand.  Impulsiveness  may include a perceived need to move on immediately to a new task, thus  leaving another unfinished (they may be enthusiastic beginners but poor  completers); impatience in waiting situations, such as in stalled traffic or  standing in a slow-moving line;  a short temper; or the tendency to respond  poorly to stress and thus become easily hassled. </p>

<p>The education community divides ADD, by definition, into two similar yet 
slightly different groups.  Individuals may be defined as having either ADD 
- Attention Deficit Disorder, or ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder, or attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity.  Adults with ADD 
or ADHD may be either slow and lethargic, or restless and fidgety.  Medical 
researchers now believe that differences in chemistry in the parts of the brain  which control inhibition may cause ADD, and may be inherited.</p>  

<H3>Historical Trends</H3>
<p>Medical and educational researchers over the past century have addressed 
various aspects of attention-related disability.  In the early 1900's,  attention- related patterns and behavior problems following brain injury were the focus  of research.  During the 1930's and 1940's, attention-related characteristics  among individuals who had not sustained brain injury or brain damage were  recognized and studied.  Our knowledge became much more defined in the  1960's, with the awareness of some of the components that play a part in an attention-related disability, such as learning disabilities, neurologic dysfunction, or behavioral symptoms.  More precision regarding the 
definition of behavioral characteristics became possible in the 1970's.  Finally,  in the 1980's, the definition of ADD was included in the Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of the Mental Disorders (DSM-III).  The DSM-III is the 
official glossary of descriptions of mental health diagnosis.  The addition of 
ADD to the DSM-III led to wide recognition of it as a specific disorder.
</p>

<H3>ADD and Adults</H3>
<p>
It is becoming clear that ADD is not a disability limited to childhood or 
adolescence.  More and more adults are discovering that they have ADD; 
current estimates are that between eight and 15 million American adults 
have the disability.  It is a high frequency and low visibility disability, 
meaning that many individuals have the disability, but its characteristics are 
not readily apparent. </p>
<p>
Some report that between one-third and one-half of children with ADD grow 
up to be adults with ADD.  While adults may be more likely to have an 
attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity, the adult will likely continue 
to experience difficulties with concentration; achieving his or her potential; 
impulsivity; behavior problems at home, school, or work; or will use poor 
judgment or have self-destructive tendencies.  Adults with ADD often 
present additional diagnoses as well, such as mild chronic depression, mood 
and energy swings, nervousness, sleep disorders, muscular tension, and/or 
learning disabilities. </p>

<p>The presence within a person of an ADD is pervasive.  It is more likely to 
affect many, or all, of an individual's life areas, rather than just one isolated 
area.  As a result, adults with ADD may experience difficulties with most life 
issues.  Some adults may be unable to complete formal education or may do 
so only with overwhelming drive.  Others may have trouble with 
interpersonal relationships.  Career problems may be present for others with 
ADD.  Career-related problems may stem from frequent job terminations 
because of poor job performance, attention and/or organization problems, 
interpersonal problems with supervisors and/or co-workers, or becoming 
easily bored and quitting a job.  Regardless of the life area in which  an adult 
with ADD is experiencing difficulties, each is likely to feel that he or she is not 
living up to his or her potential.  For relief, some may turn to intense 
physical or mental activity; others may use drugs or alcohol for self-
medication.
</p>

<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
<p>Psycho-educational  diagnosticians use a system similar to the six steps 
described below when evaluating for ADD or ADHD. </p>
  
<ol><li><h4>Understanding Current Concerns and History</h4> 
<p>Diagnosticians interview the student, and possibly his or her family in order 
to garner as much information as possible.  Given the field's emerging 
knowledge about heredity and ADD, a diagnostician may look for clues to 
indicate if characteristics were present early in an individual's life, regardless 
of whether or not the individual and/or his or her family were identified as 
having any of the characteristics of this disability. </p>

<p>Some diagnosticians develop a questionnaire, such as one described by Biggs 
and Nadeau, during this phase of the evaluation process to elicit information 
about ADD or ADHD.  Such questions as "Do you feel that you are 
organized?", or "Would you describe for me your method of organization?" 
begin to provide diagnosticians with useful insights.  Throughout the 
individual's responses, the diagnostician looks for evidence that ADD 
characteristics seem to be present in situations both in and out of the school 
or campus environment.  Questions are asked to discover the areas affected by 
ADD including reading and writing skills, mathematics, attention and 
concentration abilities, language processing, visual and spatial abilities, 
memory, processing speed, social skills, and general concerns. </p>

<li><h4>Selecting Appropriate Measures to Address Concerns</h4>
<p>Diagnosticians select tests from a large inventory of assessment tools.  The  selection is based on questions raised from the client's history.  For example,  during the evaluation process, a diagnostician may administer tests which 
will produce information about the possibilities of ADD or ADHD, learning 
disabilities, emotional problems, and/or neurological issues. </p>

<li><h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
Since each individual is unique, there is no pre-determined number of tests 
that a psychlogist or psychiatrist may administer in order to assess for ADD or 
ADHD.  
The assessments usually cover the following areas: intelligence, 
cognitive/information processing, personality, and educational - if learning 
disability is suspected. </p>

<li><h4>Analysis</h4>
<p>
During this stage of the evaluation process, the diagnosticians "play 
detective" and "put clues together." </P>
  
<li><h4>Treatment Planning Conference</h4>
<p>
The treatment planning conference always includes the diagnostician and the 
student, but may also include parents, spouse, and/or an educational 
specialist.  In the conference, test results are shared and interpreted and 
recommendations are discussed.  These may include specific 
recommendations to the student regarding study skills, and 
recommendations to the college regarding needed supports and 
accommodations.  It may include recommendations for a medication 
evaluation, for psychological counseling, and/or for tutoring.  School 
placement issues may be discussed if the student is not satisfied with his or 
her current school.  For a working adult, both school and career issues may be 
discussed. </p>

<li><h4>Written Report</h4>
<p>
The diagnostician completes a full written report, including sections that list 
the tests which were given and the scores obtained, the interpretation of those 
scores, and individualized educational recommendations based on the 
students strengths and weaknesses.  Students should review the report 
thoroughly and ask any questions that they may have, or ask for the 
diagnostician to go over the report with them.  Most diagnosticians will 
schedule a follow-up appointment with the student, after he or she has 
received the written report and has had a chance to review it.  It is extremely 
important that the student understand the full contents of the report, as such 
an understanding will help the student advocate for his or her future needs.  
In addition, students should always keep a copy of the report, as well as any 
other relevant information, for their personal reference or future need. </p>
</ul>

<p>Costs of thorough evaluations, such as the six-step process described above, do 
vary and students are encouraged to become familiar with all options 
available to them before making a final choice.  Students should also check 
with their health insurance companies to see if such an evaluation is covered 
under their policy.</p>

<H3>Relevance to Campus Disability Support Services</H3>
<p>College Offices for Disability Support Services are likely to see an increase in 
requests for services for students with ADD or ADHD.  The disability is now 
recognized in the K-12 school system and public awareness about it has been 
raised by popular media. Accommodations commonly provided by colleges 
and universities, based on the student's functional limitations, include 
extending time to complete exams or papers; using notetakers, tutors, or 
organizational supports; carrying reduced courseloads; and preferential 
registration for smaller classes. </p>

<li><p>ADD and the College Student -A Guide for High School and College 
Students with Attention Deficit Disorder (1994), by Patricia O. Quinn, M.D. 
(editor), is a 113-page compilation of user-friendly information. While ADD 
and the College Student begins by stating that it has been written for high 
school juniors and seniors and college students with attention deficit disorder  (ADD), a diverse audience can benefit from the collection of easy-to-read 
practical advice, including adults who suspect that they may have ADD, 
family members of individuals with ADD, postsecondary service providers, 
psychologists, diagnosticians, vocational rehabilitation workers, as well as 
high school teachers and college counselors. <br><br>
The first half of this 12-chapter book answers commonly asked quesitons, lists 
the major symptoms of ADD, and contains a checklist that can be used to help 
evaluate various symptoms, gain self-awareness, and provide guidance 
regarding the necessity of seeking a professional assessment. The 
biochemistry of ADD, medication, and other treatments for ADD also are 
covered. While Dr. Quinn states that she cannot endorse any of the 
alternative therapies at this point in time, she explains the basics of 
biofeedback therapy, self-control or cognitive therapy, and diet and 
megavitamin therapy. How ADD Affects You focuses on the most common 
issues faced by adolescents with ADD, both academic and social, and ends 
with personal commentaries from two college students with ADD. <br><br>

The second half of ADD and the College Student begins with Preparing for 
College: A Mother's Perspective. This personal story concludes with helpful 
hints for college students with ADD and for their parents. The remainder of 
the book leads readers through senior year at high school, college programs, 
and accommodations for students with ADD. The support services that 
postsecondary students with ADD may find helpful are described. Dr. Quinn 
points out that students can best understand which support services may be 
most helpful to them only after they understand their own learning strengths 
and weaknesses. She discusses common academic and emotional difficulties 
and then goes on to offer suggested accommodations. Quinn explains the 
three major sources from which the rights of college students with ADD 
stem: the Constitution, statues and regulations that prohibit discrimination, 
and cases decided by the courts. ADD and the College Student concludes with 
Commonly Asked Questions, which cover medicaiton, treatment programs, 
college admission and SAT's, parent involvement, learning 
accommodations, and legal issues. References to other relevant publications 
and organizations also are provided, as are the definitions of ADHD 
(Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder) used by both the American 
Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
ADD and the College Student is available from MAGINATION PRESS, 19 
Union Square West, New York, NY 10003. (800) 825-3089. The cost is $13.95, 
plus a shipping and handling fee of $2.75.

</p>

<li><p>Approaching College for the Student with ADD is one in a series of videos 
that seeks to inform students with ADD and their parents about the paths to 
success in college. In Approaching College for the Student with ADD, Dr. 
Patricia Quinn dispels the myth that ADD students could do better in school if 
only they tried harder. Quinn argues that many of these students already are 
putting considerable effort into their studies, and that for student with ADD, 
they key to success lies in developing and putting into practice strategies for 
time management, considering medication options, and continuing to seek 
supportive services. In the video, Quinn cautions students that the transition 
from high school and home to college involves enough major changes 
without making a clean break from medication or deciding to "turn over a 
new leaf" by attempting to handle course work without support services. 
Comments from Quinn are augmented by the remarks of several students 
with ADD, whose advice lends a "front  lines" pragmatism to the video. 
These students recount experiences with teachers and administrators and 
offer suggestions for effectively discussing the need for special 
accommodations. </p>

<li><p>In ADD and the College Student, another video in the series, Quinn provides 
a comprehensive list of personality traits associated with attention deficit 
disorder. For someone recently diagnosed with ADD, or for someone who 
suspects the presence of ADD, Quinn's overview of the disability is 
particularly informative. Her description of the disability emphasizes the 
increased tasks and responsibilities of personal care and academic workload 
that are associated with college life. Quinn's assessment provides a positive 
framework for understanding the disability and for developing strategies for 
the college student with ADD. <br><br>
Ann McCormick, an advisor at the American University (Washington, DC), 
follows Dr. Quinn's discussion of symptoms with examples of 
accommodations that her office commonly employs in providing for the 
needs of students with ADD. McCormick provides practical advice on 
choosing a college, and her presentation on accommodations is helpful in 
that it prepares a student with ADD for the kind of dialogue that must take 
place for an effective accommodation program to be developed. This 
discussion includes pragmatic strategies that a student with ADD can employ 
to improve his or her chances of succeeding in a college environment.
The cost of each video is $29.95. To order, prepay the Pediatric Development 
Center, 3262 Arcadia Place, NW, Washington, D.C. 20015. (202) 966-1561.
</p>

<li><p>The ABC's of ADD (1993) is a 30-minute videotape that contains basic 
information for adults with ADD, those who suspect they have ADD, family 
members of individuals with ADD, or any of the many professionals who 
may be interested in the issues associated with adults with ADD. The adult 
focus of the video is conveyed from the start of the tape, which begins with 
snippets of personal stories told by three young adults with ADD and 
segments from various professionals speaking to an audience at an earlier 
conference. <br><br>
Each section is brief, conveying basic information. First, the primary 
symptoms of ADD, including some of the most characteristic symptoms of 
both children and adults with ADD, are discussed. The video expands upon 
this discussion by presenting characteristic secondary symptoms of 
individuals with ADD. Each of the medications most commonly prescribed to 
individuals with ADD is discussed briefly and some of the common side-
effects of the various medications are mentioned. The young adults with 
ADD who appeared at the beginning of the video tell longer versions of their 
own personal stories, touching on issues associated with postsecondary 
education and employment. Common characteristics of adults with ADD also 
are presented in a personal story format. A section on legal rights concludes 
the tape, briefly laying a foundation for understanding the legislation that has 
helped prevent discrimination against individuals with disabilities.
The ABC's of ADD is available from JKL Communications, P.O. Box 41057, 
Washington, DC 20016. The cost is $29.

<P>	Take a moment to determine whether or not your child is able to accomplish the following items.</P>

<ol>

<li>Recite his or her full name, address and telephone number including area code, city and state?

<br><br><li>Use a phone to make long distance call, dial direct or get operator assistance?

<br><br><li>Does your child know to never enter anyone's home without your permission?

<br><br><li>Knows of any certain home where they are not to enter under any circumstances?

<br><br><li>If separated from you in a store, would your child go to the nearest check-out clerk?

<br><br><li>Could he or she verify that the person is in fact an employee of the store?

<br><br><li>Would he or she go into the parking lot either alone or if encouraged by an adult?

<br><br><li>Knows always to play with others - to go places on the "buddy-system?"

<br><br><li>Knows that adults seldom ask for directions from children and that if approached by a car, they should never go near or get in an automobile with a stranger?

<br><br><li>Does your child know not to accept rides from a stranger or even acquaintances without your specific permission?

<br><br><li>If home alone, knows not to answer the door or tell anyone over the phone that they are alone?

<br><br><li>If followed by an adult or stranger, would your child know to proceed immediately to a place where there are other people; e.g., a store or a neighbor's house?

<br><br><li>Would your child yell "No" and create a scene in public if they were being subjected to bad touches?

<br><br><li>Do you and your child have a code word to exchange if your plans changes?

<br><br><li>Does your child know never to talk or accept gifts of any kind from strangers?

</ol>

<P>	Every "NO" answer indicates an area of risk for your child. It is probably a good idea to ask your child these questions in a modified form as an added precaution.</P>

<P>	Never leave your child unattended. Never leave a child alone in a car. Remember, someone with experience can break into your car in less than thirty seconds.</P>

<P>	Listen when your child tells you he or she does not want to be with someone. Direct questioning may reveal something you should know about.</P>

<P>	Be involved in your child's activities. Know your child's friends.</P>

<P>	Pay attention when someone shows greater than normal interest in your child. Find out why. Be doubly cautious in this situation. Don't allow opportunities for that adult to have your child alone.</P>

<P>	Be sensitive to changes in your child's behavior or attitudes. Be especially alert for any talk betraying premature sexual understanding. Never belittle any fear or concern on the part of your children.</P>

<P>Avoid communicating hysteria or excessive fear for their safety.</P>

<P>	Be prepared to describe your children accurately; including clothing, visible identifying marks or special characteristics. Think of those items now and write them down. It may be more difficult to concentrate in a time of extreme stress.</P>

<P>	Develop a set procedure should you and your child become separated while away from home. (Example, both may call a trusted friend and leave an address and telephone number to call back. Then wait at the phone until reunited.)</P>

<P>	Do not buy items which visibly display your child's name. It could give an abductor the advantage of seeming to know your child. ("Hey, Billy, your Mom's been in an accident. We need to rush to the hospital. Jump in the car!")</P>

<P>	Take a photograph of your child each year (4 times each year if under age 2). Have several copies on hand in case your child turns up missing</P>

<P>	Be sure your child's school or day care center will not release him or her to anyone other than you or someone you officially designate.</P>

<P>	Instruct the school to contact you immediately if your child is absent, or if someone other than you arrives to pick up him or her without advance notice from you.</P>

<H2> Anno's Learning Games</H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 6-10<br> 	
Category: Math Explorations</H3>

<p>We originally rated this imaginative math title among <EM>The Computer Museum Guide's</EM> "best" products.  But when its publisher, Putnam New Media, left the software business, its future was uncertain.   We've now learned that Putnam is still selling this title. If your child loves puzzles and math challenges, Anno's is a good addition to your software library. </p>

<p>Based on the simple, fanciful artistry of picture book author/illustrator Mitsumasa Anno, <EM>Anno's Learning Games</EM> lets kids explore important mathematical relationships - without racing a clock or facing a quiz.  The product  has a quiet, water-color feel to it; animations are low-key yet clever.</p>  

<p>Seven activities allow kids to play with and master basic concepts.  Help is always at hand in the form of two quirky elves, Kriss and Kross, who introduce each game, provide explanations and often get into the act.</p>

<p><EM>Anno's</EM> most inventive game is Guess My Rule.  The fun starts with a single object (a winged horse, perhaps) that exemplifies two unstated attributes.  Kids then puzzle out the rules for categorizing six other objects and ask Kriss and Kross to test their guesses.  Tangrams, a puzzle-making and puzzle-solving activity, is another favorite.  Tangrams are ancient Chinese puzzles, consisting of seven shapes or <EM>tans</EM> cut from a square, which are then used to create new shapes.  What's that have to do with math?</p>

<p>Well, one element of math is spatial visualization; and so are tangrams. These puzzle pieces are very popular among teachers who use manipulatives to teach math, and playing with them on the computer is a wonderful at-home complement to classroom activity.</p>   

<p>The bottom line:  playing the games in <EM>Anno's</EM> really gives kids tangible insights into mathematical concepts.  A good complement to <EM>Math Workshop</EM>, because it approaches different concepts with the same spirit of fun and discovery.</p>

<p>What do preschoolers need?  Rich environments where they can explore in their own way, at their own pace.  Look for friendly characters and simple activities with lots of verbal encouragement.  But beware:  too much multimedia can overwhelm small children.  The best programs offer an uncluttered screen with navigation buttons large enough for little hands to find. </p>

<H2>Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo <img src="/images/guide-4stars-lg.gif"></H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 3-5<br> 	
Category: Fun and Games</H3>
 		
<p>We've never met a child who didn't adore playing this pint-sized, problem-solving adventure.  Perhaps it's the appeal of Putt-Putt, a cute little purple car.  Perhaps it's the involvement kids feel as they direct the story.  Whatever the reasons, the challenge of getting Putt-Putt to the zoo or the parade or back to Earth is somehow deeply satisfying for little kids.</p>

<p><EM>Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo</EM> is the newest and best-looking title in this series.  (If you're buying your first<EM> Putt-Putt</EM>, start with this one.) In this story, kids help Putt-Putt find missing animals and return them safely to the zoo.  To rescue the animals - like a lion cub perched on a ledge midway down a roaring waterfall - kids really have to think and explore and experiment.</p> 

<p>You won't find any educational agenda in the<EM> Putt-Putt</EM> titles, but there is educational value.  Kids often stick with the challenge for 45 minutes at a stretch(!), following directions, identifying numerals, matching colors and thinking their way through Putt-Putt's little problems.  And playing<EM> Putt-Putt</EM> together has been known to spark a spirited collaboration in young siblings!</p>

<p>The programs' staying power depends on your child's personality.  Some kids, once they figure out how to get Putt-Putt to the parade or back to Earth, never come back for more.  But others return again and again, much as they re-read a well-thumbed picture book you thought they'd outgrown.

<p>The bottom line:  tremendously satisfying and absorbing for many youngsters.

<H2> What's the Secret?
<img src="/images/guide-4stars-lg.gif"></H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 7-12 <br> 	
Category: Explorations ... Into Science, Nature and Beyond</H3>
  
 		
<p> What's the secret to great kids' software?  You'll find the answer by clicking around this CD-ROM.  It's the best science discovery program we've seen. <EM>What's the Secret?</EM> gives kids a real feel for doing ... and understanding ... and enjoying ... science.</p>   

<p><EM>What's the Secret?</EM> invites kids to explore the answers to 12 familiar but intriguing questions, plus a host of related ones:  when a train passes by, why does the sound change?  What keeps a roller coaster going? (Can it fall off?  Why do I get queasy?)   Why do bears hibernate?  What makes my heart beat?  (In answering that question, by the way, <EM>What's the Secret?</EM>  does a far better job than any of the dozens of anatomy titles available.)</P>

<p>Playing with <EM>What's the Secret?</EM>  is a little like taking a field trip.  But when kids get interested in something, they can stick around (instead of sticking to the teacher's timetable) and delve as deeply as they want.  Each topic holds a little universe of information that kids can explore in several ways.  There's simple but accurate text to read.  There are real-life scientists to listen to, illustrations to scrutinize, animations to probe, video clips to watch, and fun experiments to conduct, both on the computer and off.  Along the way, What's the Secret? poses lots of related questions,  so kids can take off on as many excursions as they want.</p>
<p>
<EM>What's the Secret?</EM> does a great job of making meaningful connections between science and other disciplines.  Take the What Makes My Heart Beat? area, for example.  Kids might find themselves experimenting with the systolic and diastolic components of blood pressure.  Or, they might find themselves reading about how (and why) the word "heart" pervades the English language.</p>

<p>The bottom line:  the best software to get kids really excited about science.  Based on the award-winning science TV show "Newton's Apple," <EM>What's the Secret?</EM>  is part adventure, part live-action lab and 100% terrific.  Volume 1 and 2 are both recommended.

<H2>Thinkin' Things Collection 3 </H2> 	  
<H3> For Kids 7-13 <br> 	
Category: Playing to Learn</H3>
 	 	

<p>As kids hit the double-digit ages, it gets harder and harder to find good software.  Only a handful of titles pass muster with both parents and their increasingly independent-minded offspring.  <EM>Thinkin' Things Collection 3</EM> is one of those rarities.</p>

<p>In Edmark's newest product, kids ages 7-13 encounter five thought-provoking activities and puzzles, which they tackle through a process of trial and error, developing and testing hypotheses and discovering for themselves what works - or doesn't work .  They can try their hand as detectives, commodity brokers and directors of a wild half-time football show, explore special visual effects and conduct "virtual" physics experiments.</p>

<p>As with many of the best products for this age range, <EM>Thinkin' Things Collection 3</EM> has no explicit instructions or rules.  Kids have to figure out WHAT they're supposed to be doing.  Next they have to figure out HOW to do it.  Then, there's the additional pleasure of figuring out how to do it better (and how to stump parents, siblings or friends).  As kids master one level of challenge, they can move the "Grow Slide" to a more advanced level.</p> 

<p>The bottom line:  an outstanding collection of activities that really challenge kids to think.  Great for collaborative problem solving- or solo play.  If your kids enjoyed <EM>Thinkin' Things Collection 1 and 2</EM>, they'll find plenty of fresh new challenges in <EM>Collection 3</EM>.  But no previous experience is required to jump into the quick-witted fun of  <EM>Thinkin' Things Collection 3</EM>.</p>

<p>  Best geography game to come along since <EM>Carmen Sandiego</EM>.

<EM>Travelrama</EM> is quick to hook kids with its good looks, lively music and an appealing challenge:  hit the road to collect five postcards ... before your opponents get their postcards ... and before your mileage meter runs out.</p> 

<p>Besides sheer fun, this cross-country adventure for one to four players gives kids a fairly rigorous workout not only in U.S. geography but also in problem-solving, map-reading, math and strategic thinking.  If kids don't know which states are represented by the postcards on their list, they have to figure it out.  (Players who opt for the Learner's Permit playing level get a few hints; players who select the Driver's License level have to use their wits, the resources of the <EM>Travelrama</EM> album, or outside references to pick the right destinations.)  Kids also have to pick an advantageous starting point (a good choice may net two, or even three, postcards right off the bat).  They have to map out the shortest route to other states.  And they have to outthink their opponents, too.</P>

<p>Younger players might want to play solo at first to become familiar with the game and to hone their geographical know-how before taking on opponents.  Or, they might team up with an older sibling, friend or parent. The game is most fun when lots of people play.</p>

<p>The bottom line:  a great family game since each player can compete at a different skill level.  Unlike <EM>Carmen</EM>, T<EM>ravelrama</EM> has good multimedia resources <EM>within</EM> the program for kids to learn things they don't know.<p>

<H2> Widget Workshop
<img src="/images/guide-2stars-lg.gif"></H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 10 and Up <br> 	
Category: Explorations ... Into Science, Nature and Beyond</H3>
  
 		
<p> An intriguing hands-on science kit, for use on the computer and off.  <EM>Widget Workshop</EM> lets kids devise gadgets and puzzles and "what if?" experiments, by connecting up widgets and seeing what happens.  It pushes them to think harder than most other software.  But it's so challenging that many kids will need your help to take advantage of everything it offers.</p>

,p>In <EM>Widget Workshop</EM>, kids build things simply by clicking among a wide array of widget parts - like timers, sounds, and switches  - dragging them into an on-screen workspace and clicking to connect them all.  Click a keypad widget, for example, and click again to connect it to the solar system "superpart."  Click and connect a "multiplier." Then, push the green "Go" button and watch the results.  Kids jump right into this kind of trial-and-error discovery without hesitation (although our testers recommend working through the software tutorial, too).</p> 

<p>Beside making their own inventions, kids can tackle one of 25 challenging puzzle widgets or 30 experiments in the Workshop Activities book.  Using both the software and the tools packaged with it - magnifier, thermometer, spinning top and more - kids can explore distance, speed, gravity, sound, light and weather, computer programming and a lot of math.  Starting with simple constructions, <EM>Widget Workshop</EM> takes kids into abstractions like digital data, logic gates, flow charts, and mathematical formulas.</p> 

<p>The bottom line:  a good program for children who love mental challenges and for families that like to explore science together.</p>

<h2><a name = "learning"> Learning</h2>

<p>We've discovered that a great many wonderful-sounding titles actually offer little more than mindless point-and-click activities.  They call themselves interactive.  But in reality, they promote passive viewing.</p>

<p>The child's experience with them is often not much more demanding that surfing TV channels with the remote control.  Lots of reference products fall prey to this problem.  So do products that co-opt footage from movies, TV shows or comic books.  So does a lot of storybook software.</p>

<p>To help your child avoid brainless pointing-and-clicking, here are some questions you can ask about a program's learning experience:<p>
<ul>
<li>	Does it invite active participation, exploration and discovery?<br>
<li>	Does it inspire kids to put their new-found knowledge to work?
</ul>

<br>
<h2><a name = "looks"> Looks</h2>
 

<p>Multimedia, we think, is a real step forward since it offers kids multiple ways to learn: through words, music and sound, animation, video.</p>

<p>But too many titles fall prey to the multimedia-for-multimedia's-sake syndrome.  Confronted with overabundant special effects, kids often lose track of what they're doing and why.</p>     

<p>So it's important to step back from the technology and ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Does it achieve the best possible balance of multimedia elements?
<li>	Does its use of multimedia really enhance the learning experience?
</ul>


<br>
<h2><a name = "longevity"> Longevity</h2>
  

<p>We like to see kids come back to good software the way they come back to a good book.  (And we like to see parents get their money's worth, too.)  So we tested every title for replay value.  We asked ourselves and our test families:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Is this a program kids come back to again and again?
<li>	Or do they lose interest once the novelty wears off?
</ul>
<p>We found that the more a program asks of a child, the more a child gets out of it.  Many of the best programs are "tools" that let kids create something new and unique every time they play.  Like art or story writing programs.  For older kids, the challenge of a mystery or a quest to solve keeps them coming back - far more than a click-and-browse-type activity does.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name = "new">A New Dimension</h2>  

<p>Here's the acid test for evaluating kids' software.  It's the Museum's most distinctive question:  does the software use technology to add a new dimension to the learning experience ... something kids couldn't get in any other way?</p>  

<p>The Sim series from Maxis is a good example.   Kids 10 and up are ready for SimCity or the newer SimTower, especially if you help them get started.  Younger kids can start with SimTown.  These computer models of real-life situations let kids step into different roles, experiment with decision-making and experience the consequences of their choices.  And these are experiences that kids can only have with the computer.</p>

<p> Take a look at the previews of <a href="/kidsource/software/casper.html">Casper Brainy Book </a> or <a href="/kidsource/software/ocean.html">Ocean Planet Smithsonian</a> in the Reviews section of this site for examples of titles that fail to meet the Museum's high standards for the best kids' software.

<H2>What's The Computer Museum?</H2>  

<p><a href= "http://www.tcm.org">The Computer Museum </a> in Boston is the country's only museum focused exclusively on computer technology.   It's introduced more kids and families to computers than any other place in the world.</p>  

<p>With record numbers of computers being purchased for home use - they're selling at the rate of two per second right now! - the Museum was seeing more and more families introduce their kids to computing.  Lots of families were looking for advice.  And parents told the Museum they wanted a software review as reliable as Consumer Reports and as lively and down-to-earth as Siskel and Ebert. 
</p>
<p>So in partnership with the Museum, authors Cathy Miranker and Alison Elliott put its decade of experience to work  to answer parents' questions.

<H2>Kids and Computers: What's the Museum's Vision?</H2> 

<p>Thanks to the Museum's years of creating and testing interactive learning exhibits, the Computer Museum Guide has a unique perspective - and exceptionally high expectations - about children's software.</p>  

<p>We believe the computer can be far more - and far better - than a quiz master, drilling kids on math facts or state capitals.</p>

<p>We favor software that uses technology to let kids learn by doing ... that encourages kids to create ... to experiment ... to make choices ... to solve problems (or better still, to create problems to solve!) ... that creates a compelling environment for exploration.  That stimulates kids' natural curiosity and satisfies their intrinsic need to learn.</p>

<p>Guided by expectations like these, the Museum created a book that serves as a road map to the best things a child can do with a computer.  We think you'll find that The Computer Museum Guide charts a quick route to the best titles for your child's age, interests and learning style.</p>

<h2> How Do We Evaluate Children's Software?</h2> 

<p>There were three stages to our evaluation process.</p>
<ul>
<li>	First we worked with Museum experts to develop an exacting set of standards.<br>

<li>	Next we personally tested close to 1,000 titles against those ideals.<br>

<li>	Then, programs that made it past this first level of scrutiny were turned over to the toughest critics of all, our test families.  These families used the software in their homes over several months.  And we spent lots of time talking with kids and parents, one on one, to understand what they liked and why.<br>
</ul>
<p>We'd like to give you a closer look at the questions we asked during every evaluation, so you can begin subjecting programs to the same kind of scrutiny.</p>

<p>Our criteria sound simple enough:   
<ul><li><a href="/kidsource/software/learning.html">Learning</a> 
<li><a href="/kidsource/software/looks.html">Looks</a>
<li><a href="/kidsource/software/longevity.html">Longevity </a>   
</ul>

But we read a lot into these words, as you'll see.</p>

<p>And finally, we asked the most important question of all:  does the software bring a truly <a href ="/kidsource/software/dimension.html">new dimension </a> <!--[A-7]--> to learning?<p>

<h2> Looks</h2>
 

<p>Multimedia, we think, is a real step forward since it offers kids multiple ways to learn: through words, music and sound, animation, video.</p>

<p>But too many titles fall prey to the multimedia-for-multimedia's-sake syndrome.  Confronted with overabundant special effects, kids often lose track of what they're doing and why.</p>     

<p>So it's important to step back from the technology and ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Does it achieve the best possible balance of multimedia elements?
<li>	Does its use of multimedia really enhance the learning experience?
</ul>

<h2> Longevity</h2>
  

<p>We like to see kids come back to good software the way they come back to a good book.  (And we like to see parents get their money's worth, too.)  So we tested every title for replay value.  We asked ourselves and our test families:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Is this a program kids come back to again and again?
<li>	Or do they lose interest once the novelty wears off?
</ul>
<p>We found that the more a program asks of a child, the more a child gets out of it.  Many of the best programs are "tools" that let kids create something new and unique every time they play.  Like art or story writing programs.  For older kids, the challenge of a mystery or a quest to solve keeps them coming back - far more than a click-and-browse-type activity does.</p>

<h2>A New Dimension</h2>  

<p>Here's the acid test for evaluating kids' software.  It's the Museum's most distinctive question:  does the software use technology to add a new dimension to the learning experience ... something kids couldn't get in any other way?</p>  

<p>The Sim series from Maxis is a good example.   Kids 10 and up are ready for SimCity or the newer SimTower, especially if you help them get started.  Younger kids can start with SimTown.  These computer models of real-life situations let kids step into different roles, experiment with decision-making and experience the consequences of their choices.  And these are experiences that kids can only have with the computer.</p>

<p> Take a look at the previews of <a href="/kidsource/software/casper.html">Casper Brainy Book </a> or <a href="/kidsource/software/ocean.html">Ocean Planet Smithsonian</a> in the Reviews section of this site for examples of titles that fail to meet the Museum's high standards for the best kids' software.

<H2>Finding the Best Software for Different Ages </H2> 

<p>When you're raising kids, you quickly discover that each age brings its own special delights and challenges.  And the best kids' software developers, like astute parents and teachers, understand what kids of different ages like to do, how they learn, what makes them laugh.

<p>But the age ranges on a software package can sometimes be misleading.  Not surprisingly, software publishers label their products with the widest possible age range.  Our suggestion:  Buy at the bottom of the range so your kids will get the most play time out of the software.

<p>Here's what we look for in software at different ages, along with some of our favorite "age appropriate" titles.  For more software recommendations for each age group, check out The Best Lists section in <EM>The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids</EM>.

<H3>For 2-3 Year Olds</H3>  Remember that little kids learn through play.  So programs that foster playful, imaginative activities are best. <a href="/kidsource/software/putt.html"> Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo </a> by Humongous lets kids help a cute purple car named Putt-Putt rescue missing animals and return them to the zoo. If your kids are still mastering the mouse, let them point the way while you do the clicking.

<H3><b>For 4-5 Year Olds </b></H3>  Young learners love a combination of open-ended exploration plus the satisfaction of accomplishing manageable tasks.  And for kids this age, don't forget the silliness factor.  One program that really gets kids giggling is AlphaBonk Farm from <a href="http://www.headbone.com"> Headbone Interactive </a>.  As kids explore the program's strikingly original activities, they also get lots of exposure to letter recognition and pre-reading skills. 

<H3><b>For 6-7 Year Olds </b></H3> This is the age when kids begin their love affair with games.  Naturally they prefer to win.  And happily the computer lets kids play over and over until they do.  One of the best computer games ever created - Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? - is now available in a Junior Detective Edition from <a href="http://www.broderbund.com">Broderbund</a>.  Beside the fun of tracking Carmen across the continents, first- and second-graders get to exercise their visual memory and practice reasoning skills. 

<H3><b>For 8-9 Year Olds </b></H3> Kids are instinctive storytellers and at this age, they can handle some fairly elaborate tools for creating artwork and expressing themselves.  One of our favorites, Imagination Express  from Edmark, lets kids create the best-looking books - on screen or in print - we've ever seen  from a computer.

<H3><b>For 10-12 Year Olds </b></H3> Older kids need the challenge of a quest, a mystery, or a problem-solving game.  Software simulations, where they step into someone else's shoes, make decisions and experience the consequences, are especially good.  With <!--<a href="/kidsource/software/sim.html">--><b>SimTower</b>  from <a href="http://www.maxis.com/maxhome.html"> Maxis </a>, kids are in charge of creating and managing a vertical city.  Be prepared to lend a hand with younger kids and first-time players.  And don't be surprised if you get hooked on this high-rise adventure, too.

<H2>Baby ROM</H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 6 months-48 months<br> 	
Category:  Playing to Learn</H3>
  
 		
<p>Software for babies?  We kid you not.  <EM>Baby ROM</EM> is lap-ware designed for you and your baby to play together.  And as your baby grows, this CD-ROM offers charming new ways for your child to explore numbers, letters, shapes, and colors.   
</p>  
 
<p>Start your littlest one in "BabyTalk," a kind of interactive board-book filled with pictures of other babies.  Touching any keyboard key fills the screen with a video of a baby laughing, crying, giggling or eating.  As your child gains hand-eye coordination, you'll find activities that introduce numbers (find the key that corresponds to the number on the screen),  letters (press the L key and see a picture-book illustration of  a lawnmower or a lemon), and body parts (click on a little boy's nose and watch it lengthen like Pinocchio's).   
</p>

<p>Because <EM>Baby ROM</EM>  has three levels of play, children can continue to play it up through the ages of 3 or 4.   But even when your child takes over the mouse, parents should stay close.  Like reading a book together, what happens between you and your child at the computer is just as important as what they see on the screen.</p>

<H2>Circus!</H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 4-8<br> 	
Category:  Playing to Learn</H3>
  
 		
<p>The best mix of intuitive learning and exuberance we've seen. <EM>Circus!</EM> invites children into the world of a one-ring circus, where they can participate in backstage and bigtop activities, enjoy catchy music, and discover hidden surprises.   
</p>  
 
<p>Almost everywhere kids click, there are silly antics to watch.  But there's plenty of opportunity to get into the act, too - eight different acts, in fact.  Seemingly simple, these circus acts pose a real imaginative challenge for kids (and adults).  You think it's easy measuring out the right combination of kazoom powder (for height) and shazzam powder (for speed) to blast a clown out of a cannon in just the right direction to snatch a parrot off a trapeze?  Figure it out, and the hapless human cannonball will stop barreling through the tent, and your kids will learn something about physics, too.</p>

<p>Teaching the baby elephants to waltz is also harder than it looks.  And unless your kids have a perfect eye for complex sequences, freeing the clowns that Rex the magician traps in a fiendish cylinder may take hours of clicking and experimenting.</p> 
 
<p>For the youngest players, there are plenty of innocent pleasures.  In the clown's camper backstage, they can toy with theatrical makeup to create dozens of different clown 
faces or dress up circus performers for the big parade.  In the Music Tent, they can strike up a tune on the instruments, and watch as magic emerges with every note!</p>   

<p>The bottom line:  spirited fun with strong appeal for kids across a wide age range. </p>

<H2> Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show</H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids Ages 5 and up<br> 	
Category: Fun and Games</H3>
  
 		
<p>   Generations of little girls have delighted in Madeline, the petite Parisian schoolgirl with a mind of her own .  Madeline has been electronic for while, with her own videotapes, and a TV cartoon series.  Now she has her first CD-ROM.</P>   

<p><EM>Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show</EM> is not the usual electronic storybook , in which text and illustrations  are replicated on the screen.  Instead, this CD-ROM creates  an original story that kids help to develop.  Happily,  the artwork and storyline - along with the heroine's plucky spirit - are pleasingly true to the gentle spirit of the originals. Lively music and the suave narration of Christopher Plummer (both featured in the TV cartoons and videotapes) add to the multimedia pleasures of this  attractive CD-ROM.  <EM>Mais c'est dommage!</EM>  The program does not live up to the "educational" promises  that it will introduce beginning French, Spanish, and spelling skills.</p>

<p>The story:  Madeline's kindly old neighbor Mr Benet (along with his large menagerie of animals) face eviction by a greedy landlord.  True to character, Madeline jumps in with plans to save the day:  She and her classmates will give a puppet show to raise money to pay the rent.  Your child's mission:  Guide Madeline on a quest for all the things she'll need to make the puppets and organize the show.</p>  

<p>The software lets children wander in and out of the rooms in Madeline's large home and through her Parisian neighborhood.  Kids  interpret verbal clues to figure out what they must find - invitations to the show, balloons, a cape to serve as the theater's curtain.  As they click,  they trigger animations (statues speak, chandeliers spin) and collect various objects (a loaf of bread, a jump rope) that are stored for future use.   (If this sounds a bit like the Putt-Putt adventures from Humongous, you're right;  Madeline was designed by the same team.)    Along the way, kids also encounter activities like painting backdrops and making puppets as well as a matching game that introduces the French and Spanish words for lamp, stairs, rug, chandelier and clock.</p>

<p>While the product's click-and-explore gameplay is on target for 5-year-old  fans of Madeline,  there's a major flaw in this CD-ROM adventure:  the age appropriateness of its activities is all mixed up.  Kids from 5 to 7 will enjoy the hide-and-seek explorations; but older kids expect a more compelling challenge.  Older kids might get some benefit from the  limited vocabulary lessons; but beginning readers will be in the dark after the first level because the software fails to read the words out loud.  And while the game's "creative" activities support the storyline, they are sadly limited. Clicking on a choice of  a simple costume for a puppet is more suited to a 3 year old than a child 5 and above.   (A more thoughtfullly designed creative adventure would  let kids print out the invitations they create, the puppet theater they design and all the Madeline characters  so they could create their own adventures off the screen.)</p>

<p>The bottom line:  good fun for young Madeline fans.  But parents looking for long-lasting creative challenges and an adventure that fosters real learning skills should make another choice.</p>

<p>The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids uses a two-step process to evaluate software.  The first step:  the Guide's authors evaluate a program against the Museum's standards for learning, looks and longevity.  The second step:  families use the program at home and share their experience and opinions.  In the Guide's reviews, you'll find this family perspective reflected in a program's description and its star rating.  Previews, on the other hand, alert you to new programs that meet -- or fail to meet-- the Museum's criteria for excellence before they have been fully kid-tested and rated.

<p>As children move into elementary school, many parents look for software that supports the reading and math skills kids are developing in school.  Happily, the best software programs offer creative activities or engaging games in which kids have fun while they practice. Try to strike a balance between directed activities where kids must respond in a prescribed way and more open-ended tools where a child's imagination and self expression 
take the lead. </p>

<p>While much of the creative energy in the software industry is directed at little kids, we're finding some exciting new products for the older-elementary and middle-school crowd  They're creative, funky, tremendously challenging-and still very educational.  As you look for other titles, bear in mind that kids in the double-digit ages need engaging products that are more than just drill-and-practice or reference works for helping with homework.  They love simulations, adventures, brain teasers, quests and games.  And many are ready for adult software.

<p>One of the best ways to ensure that your home computer doesn't become an electronic baby-sitter is to stay closely involved with your kids' computing activities.  Make time to watch them use their programs, play with them, collaborate, compete and talk about their on-screen endeavors.  We're constantly on the look-out for titles that families can use together-the way you'd pore over a coffee-table book together, watch a video or shout out answers to a TV quiz show.   Titles like these make the family computer a new focus for together-time.

<H2> Anno's Learning Games</H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 6-10<br> 	
Category: Math Explorations</H3>

<p>We originally rated this imaginative math title among <EM>The Computer Museum Guide's</EM> "best" products.  But when its publisher, Putnam New Media, left the software business, its future was uncertain.   We've now learned that Putnam is still selling this title. If your child loves puzzles and math challenges, Anno's is a good addition to your software library. </p>

<p>Based on the simple, fanciful artistry of picture book author/illustrator Mitsumasa Anno, <EM>Anno's Learning Games</EM> lets kids explore important mathematical relationships - without racing a clock or facing a quiz.  The product  has a quiet, water-color feel to it; animations are low-key yet clever.</p>  

<p>Seven activities allow kids to play with and master basic concepts.  Help is always at hand in the form of two quirky elves, Kriss and Kross, who introduce each game, provide explanations and often get into the act.</p>

<p><EM>Anno's</EM> most inventive game is Guess My Rule.  The fun starts with a single object (a winged horse, perhaps) that exemplifies two unstated attributes.  Kids then puzzle out the rules for categorizing six other objects and ask Kriss and Kross to test their guesses.  Tangrams, a puzzle-making and puzzle-solving activity, is another favorite.  Tangrams are ancient Chinese puzzles, consisting of seven shapes or <EM>tans</EM> cut from a square, which are then used to create new shapes.  What's that have to do with math?</p>

<p>Well, one element of math is spatial visualization; and so are tangrams. These puzzle pieces are very popular among teachers who use manipulatives to teach math, and playing with them on the computer is a wonderful at-home complement to classroom activity.</p>   

<p>The bottom line:  playing the games in <EM>Anno's</EM> really gives kids tangible insights into mathematical concepts.  A good complement to <EM>Math Workshop</EM>, because it approaches different concepts with the same spirit of fun and discovery.</p>

<p>The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids is filled with useful lists that help parents quickly find the Museum's best programs by age or subject.  Since Kidsource parents appreciate the efficiency of "recommendation" lists, we've included two of the Guide's most unique "Best Lists."   We hope these inspire you with new ways to think about software for your kids. </p>

<p><EM>The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids</EM> is filled with useful lists that help parents quickly find the Museum's best programs by age or subject.  Since Kidsource parents appreciate the efficiency of "recommendation" lists, we've included two of <EM>the Guide's</EM> most unique "Best Lists."   We hope these inspire you with new ways to think about software for your kids. You'll see these lists best with a browser that supports tables.  If your browser doesn't, then view <a href="/kidsource/software/bestalt.html"> our alternate format</a></p>

<H2>Casper Brainy Book</H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 4 - 8  <br> 	
Category: Stories on Screen</H3>	

<!-- [F-1] 	Casper Brainy Book Ages 4 - 8 New But Not So Notable -->

<p>Companies that make kids'  products know that "licensed" characters sell.  Add Simba to a towel or Big Bird to a pair of pajamas, and kids love it.  So don't be surprised if your kids pull <EM>Casper Brainy Book</EM> off the shelf and tell you it's the software they really want!</p>  

<p>Casper Brainy Book is a 12-page interactive story, plus three reading games and full-motion video clips from the movie (in case your kids would rather watch than read).  The story is rather short on words - each page includes only a line or two of text - and the animated illustrations do not measure up to the usually delightful artistic standards of childrens' storybooks.  We've found that <EM>Stories on Screen</EM> often lead kids back to reading the book.  In fact, all Living Books titles come with a copy of the book right in the software package.   But with <EM>Casper</EM>, no book is included.</p>

<p>The <EM>Casper</EM> games don't do much to inspire kids with the joys of reading, either.  One game is simply a series of visual puzzles, an activity which we've found works better for most kids the old-fashioned way, off the computer.  Another is a concentration game where kids match words to pictures.  In the third,  kids place falling, Tetris-like letters into a word by pushing the arrow keys.</p>

<p>Casper may be a friendly ghost, but our kid testers found this program to be decidedly<EM> unfriendly</EM>.  Eager to begin, they raced through every page and then turned to the games.  But before they could play, the software required them to "unlock" each game with a set of keys hidden among the pages of the story.  Unhappily, they discovered that the keys could be found only by listening to every page of the (not too interesting) story all over again.  One test family was appalled when their 5-year-old collapsed in tears of frustration.  Although she recognized every letter in the falling letter game, she couldn't move the mouse or tap the arrow keys fast enough to get them in the right place.</p>

<p>The bottom line:  If you're looking for an interactive storybook to inspire young readers, this is <EM>not</EM> your best choice.  Casper fans - stick with the movie version!  Get the <EM>Guide</EM> for reviews of some great interactive stories in our <EM>Stories on Screen</EM> and <EM>New and Notable </EM>chapters.</p>

<H2>Ocean Planet Smithsonian</H2> 	  
<H3>For All ages</H3>
	

<p>Good TV show, mediocre software.</p>

<p>Thanks to The Computer Museum's years of creating and testing interactive learning exhibits, <EM>The Computer Museum Guide</EM> has a unique perspective - and exceptionally high expectations - about children's software.  We favor software that uses technology to let kids learn by doing ... that encourages kids to create ...  to experiment ...  to make choices ...  to solve problems (or better still, to create problems to solve!) ...  that creates a compelling environment for exploration.  And for fun.</p> 

<p>We're continually surprised at how many software publishers miss the mark.  Too many simply co-opt content from movies, TV or books, add some buttons and menus, and call it interactive learning.  In reality, the experience they've created is often not much more challenging than surfing TV channels with the remote control.  There's lots of pointing and clicking, but not much thinking going on.</p>  

<p>The CD-ROM programs produced by the Discovery Channel are a case in point.  <EM>Ocean Planet Smithsonian, Nile: Passage to Egypt, Sharks! and In the Company of Whales</EM> all make use of existing video footage from some of Discovery's excellent cable TV documentaries.  And then they essentially "deconstruct" the shows, chopping the original programs into their component parts.  What started out as a cohesive narrative turns into nuggets of information, sound bytes and video clips that kids can click in any order.</p>

<p>Individually, some of these snippets are commendable.  The video selections in Ocean Planet's "undersea theatre" are interesting.  A panel of ocean experts provides informative answers to questions.   The "oceanic library" offers reasonably detailed text.</p>

<p>Most snippets, however, yield up very little information despite the tedious amount of pointing and clicking it takes to get there.  Here's the result of clicking into the "Ocean Food Web" topic:  "Isn't it amazing that something as big as this whale eats something as small as these plankton?"  Click on "A Sun for All Seasons" and you hear this:  "You may not always need sunglasses but the sun always affects the weather in our atmosphere."</p>  

<p>When kids click a topic titled "Land Down Under," they see a few seconds of video and hear this voice-over:  "Imagine draining the water from the oceans.  What would you see?  The same thing you'd see on land:  canyons, mountains, deserts."  The video ends, the sound of the waves fades, the narrator falls silent.  And kids are faced with a choice.  Should they click back and choose another topic in the "Land Under Water" section? Should they click the "Related Topics" button?  Should they click the "Article" button?  The "History" button?  If they opt for a related topic, should it be the next one on the list - Plate Tectonics - or a different one?</p>

<p>Yes, the kids have total control.  But what they don't have is a context for understanding the oceans of information they click.  There's no way for kids to assess the value of what they see and hear.  There's no way to know whether one choice is better than another or which choice they should make first ...  or second ...  or third.  There's no way for kids to know the relative importance of the different topics. There's no thoughtful agenda to provoke challenging questions and rigorous answers.</p>

<p>Programs like these are little more than random collections of facts.  And the kids' "interactive" involvement is nothing more than deciding where to point and click. Stick to the TV shows.</p>

<H2>With Open Eyes </H2> 	  
<H3>For All ages<br> 	
Category:  Family Fun</H3>							     
<p>Attention art lovers!</p>  

<p>If you're the kind of family that loves <EM>I Spy</EM> books, check out this imaginative new CD-ROM from the Art Institute of Chicago and Voyager.  <EM>With Open Eyes</EM> lets you and your kids explore great works of art - up close - without the lurking presence of cautious guards, ready to pounce when your kids threaten to touch!</p>

<p><EM>With Open Eyes</EM> is filled with beautiful pictures of more than 200 works representing diverse art forms from different cultures and time periods.   They're all mixed up in an eclectic flow of images that jump from a Peruvian portrait vessel to a Renaissance madonna to a Duchamps sculpture to a Chinese brush painting to an Egyptian mummy case to Monet's water lilies.  Large, colorful icons let kids explore the art in different ways.  They can click on a magnifying glass to zoom in on details or click on a ruler to view a work as it is displayed in the museum.</p>

<p>Best of all,  the program genuinely involves kids - much like a clever docent with a sense of humor and respect for a child's point of view.  Each image is accompanied by a voice-over peppered with leading questions:  "Is this sculpture supposed to be a horse or a train or both?"  "Is this a painting of a painter or a photo of a photographer? "  Clicking on the game button lets kids explore in other ways:  reconstructing a puzzle or figuring out what's missing from the picture, for example.</p>

<p>Like a visit to a museum, <EM>With Open Eyes</EM> works best as a shared experience.  Left on their own, most kids quickly run through all the hot spots and lose interest.  But accompanied by an enthusiastic adult,  kids of all ages will respond to the rich images,  ponder the intriguing questions and raise many of their own.  "Was that before the dinosaurs?" queried my 5-year-old as we viewed a statue created 4,000 years ago.  "Are angels always babies?"  asked her 4-year-old sister.   Be prepared for serious conversation.  In viewing great art, kids can't help but encounter war, religion, birth and death- the universal themes of human existence. </p>

<H2> Davidson's Kid Phonics
<img src="/images/guide-3stars-lg.gif"></H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 4-6 <br> 	
Category: Reading Skills</H3>
  
 		
<p>A clever and effective program that uses the computer's audio capabilities to help beginning readers fine-tune their awareness of letter sounds.  Filled with sounds, songs, and rhymes, <EM>Davidson's Kid Phonics</EM> provides a wealth of appealing opportunities to discover how sounds and letters knit themselves into words and sentences.</p>  
 
<p>In the Sound Buster game, kids hear sound clues and click on different critters called Busters to find a matching sound.  Challenges include identifying sounds, songs,  rhyming words, words that will end a nursery rhyme, and more.  (Try a couple yourself; they're not as easy as you may think!)</p>

<p>Every right answer reveals a bit of a hidden scene.  When the whole scene appears, kids can choose a picture and build the word it represents, again by clicking different Busters to hear various phonetic possibilities and dragging the right pieces together.  Once the word is correctly spelled, kids can easily build sentences around it (some silly, some sensible) by clicking on different verbs, objects and adjectives.  Finally, they can color the picture and print the page for their personal word dictionary.</p> 
 
<p>In the Word Builder, kids pick one of 200 pictures and again build the word it represents by finding and assembling the right sounds.  Its "Show Me" button is a terrific, animated tutor that steps kids through the process of putting letters where they belong and then sounding them out, individually and in combination.</p>   

<p>The bottom line:  excellent use of multimedia to enliven the mechanics of reading.  A good follow-up to <EM>Bailey's Book House</EM>, and a nice balance to <EM>Stories on Screen</EM> titles.

<h2>Pantsylvania </h2>
<H3>For Kids 4-8<br> 	
 Category: Playing to Learn</H3>

<p>The folks at Headbone Interactive are back again with their refreshingly original approach to kids' software.  Like its predecessor, <EM>AlphaBonk Farm</EM>, this imaginative CD-ROM is part exploration and part escapade, topped with visual pizzazz and loads of silly fun. </p>  

<p>This time the action moves to Pantsylvania, home of the Fancypants and their befuddled leader, Kingamajig.  Kids can visit 10 different locations in this wacky world - the factory, Symfunny Hall, Kid U., the House of Beauty, the hub of Pantsportation, and more - all with plenty of songs, rhymes, stories, and games.  At the Pants Factory, for example, kids can learn fun facts about famous inventions like the wheel or the computer.  They can hunt for hidden numbers in the machine shop.  Or they can run the See'em-Hear'em-Move'em-izer, a wild invention that lets kids select attributes to transform the ordinary ( cats or hedgehogs, for example) into the extraordinary (like a glow-in-the-dark cat that meows like an electric guitar and moves like a rocket ship).</p>  

<p>Parents will be pleased to know that amid all this madcap fun, kids are learning, too.  Pantsylvania provides up-close, hands-on (and humorous) experience with places like schools, factories, restaurants, and parks and their related cultural and social functions.

<H2>Zurk's Alaskan Trek</H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 6-10<br> 	
Category: Explorations...Into Science</H3>	
       

<p>When The Computer Museum evaluates children's software, we ask one over-riding question:  Does it use technology to add a valuable new dimension to the learning experience... something that kids can't get in quite any other way?</p>

<p>When it comes to <EM>Zurk's Alaskan Trek</EM>, the answer is a resounding 'Yes.'  The latest in the <EM>Zurk's</EM> series takes 6-10-year-olds to the 49th state where they can discover and experiment with the real-life interactions of animals and plants in three different ecosystems.</p>

<p>The software's technology underpinnings are truly inventive:  there's a kind of  "intelligence" built into every plant and animal in this title.  Wolves, for example, are programmed with a predatory instinct while hares head for their burrows at the first sign of danger.</p>

<p>Using these "intelligent," animated building blocks,  children can populate scenes with animals and plants against the backdrop of the Denali region, tundra or ice floes.  Then they can observe as animal instincts trigger true-to-life interactions.  (Yes, we're talking nature red in tooth and claw.)  Kids can capture these natural dramas as animated stories.  And they can write accompanying scripts, too, drawing on a built-in field guide for information.  In a nice touch, kids can even alter Nature's script, turning prey into predator for a change.</p>

<p>Like the other <EM>Zurk's</EM> titles, this one does a masterful job of integrating math, life-sciences and language-arts activities into an exotic natural setting.  Underlying the movie-making and scripting activities, for example, are early programming skills and implicit lessons in sentence structure and composition.  Math comes into play, too, when the animals from the Denali and tundra reappear in a hands-on activity that introduces equations while kids weigh different animals.</p>

<p>The bottom line:  The best of the <EM>Zurk's</EM> titles.  A visually stunning product that uses a powerful technology to create a unique, challenging and playful environment.</p>

<H2>Hollywood</H2> 	  
<H3>For Kids 9 and Up<br> 	
Categories: Wordplay and Storytelling</H3>
  
<p>A sophisticated, entertaining, and instructive tool for creating animated stories.  <EM>Hollywood</EM> inspires kids to write because they can instantly see their words come alive on the screen.  Not only do their characters move, but they also speak the lines that kids write.</p>

<p>Twenty different backdrops inspire the action:   a talk show set, a diner, a sports arena, a space ship.  Kids can cast up to 10 off-beat characters in a show and develop their personalities by making choices about occupations (rock star or doctor, for example), hobbies (sky-diving or bowling, perhaps), moods (from paranoid to happy) and voices (whispery, commanding, and more).  To move a character, kids simply click and drag it into position.  An array of facial expressions, body language, and  actions (talking on the phone or eating a pizza, for example) can be connected with a character.  And, of course, kids can add sound effects and theme music.</p>

<p>Click any character, and kids  instantly become scriptwriters.  <EM>Hollywood's</EM> smartest feature:  The software seems to "know" every character (as well as who they're with and where they are) and makes customized suggestions for story starters, plot twists, and dialog any time kids want help.  It automatically incorporates stage directions like entrances and exits as well as the narration and dialog kids write.   Any change in the script is instantly reflected in the action, and any change in the action produces an instant update in the script.  And during both the creative process and the performance, <EM>Hollywood</EM> lip-synchs the dialog and reads the characters' lines with one of the best text-to-speech voice generators we've heard.</p>   

<p>Add-on story packs with new settings and characters extend the life of the software. <p>

<H2>The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain </H2>	
<H3>For Kids 9 and Up
<br>Category: 	Fun and Games </H3> 

<p>One of the most challenging and addictive set of brain teasers to come along since <EM>Myst</EM>.  Hundreds of word and logic puzzles, memory and strategy games, problem-solving  adventures, visualization and musical challenges - each at three levels of difficulty - make playing <EM>The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain</EM> a great activity for everyone in the family.</p>

<p>The story is hokey but appealing:  Dr. Brain has inadvertently transferred his mind into Rathbone, his laboratory rat.  To reverse the brain drain - and win the game -players have to complete brain teasers in 10 different puzzle areas.  In the Music Region, for example, kids have to unscramble mixed-up musical measures, flipping measures horizontally and vertically at the Expert and Genius levels of play.  (For parents, it's a pleasure to hear substantial passages from classical composers in this musical memory game.)  In the Motor Programming game, kids select a series of commands - and learn the rudiments of programming in the process - in order to maneuver around a maze. 

With its stress on diverse intellectual challenges, Dr. Brain is a good companion to <EM>Thinkin' Things Collection 2 </EM>(Page 34) and <EM>Thinkin' Things Collection 3 </EM>(Page 34).  Dr. Brain addicts may also enjoy the earlier games in this series, <EM>The Island of Dr. Brain</EM> and <EM>The Castle of Dr. Brain.</EM>  The newest title, however, features the best graphics, animation, and music in the series.

<P>
LANCASTER, Pa., March 5 -- One in 20 American
children has a serious eye disorder.  Without early intervention and treatment,
those children -- approximately 1.2 million kids -- will suffer permanent vision
damage.  Earlier vision testing enables treatment when it is still effective. 
Unfortunately, current testing methods pediatricians and other primary care
doctors use for preverbal children (age 3 and under) will often miss serious eye
problems.</P>
<P>
Most American children get their first full vision examination when they start
school and are old enough to read an eye chart.  Sadly, that is usually too late
for effective treatment of serious eye disorders such as amblyopia ("lazy eye").
 The best age to detect and treat such conditions is between one and three
years.  The sooner a problem is detected, the easier it is to treat -- or even
cure.</P>
<P>
Refractive errors, astigmatism, cataracts and strabismus can lead to amblyopia,
which is a loss of vision caused by uneven strength of the eyes.  Amblyopia is
treatable if caught early.  Treatment involves wearing glasses, patching the
eye, eye drops, or surgery.  Children who receive early treatment often go on to
enjoy a lifetime of good vision. However, if treatment is not started early,
vision damage is permanent and can even lead to blindness.  In fact, amblyopia
is the leading cause of monocular blindness today.</P>
<P>
It is an insidious condition.  In a recent article on amblyopia, Dr. James D.
Reynolds of the University of Arkansas School of Medicine writes, "Amblyopia is
a very common, serious disease of childhood that often has no signs or symptoms.
 Without early and proper treatment, it can produce a lifetime visual
disability."</P>
<P>
But a revolutionary new camera, the MTI PhotoScreener, can effectively screen
preverbal children for eye problems.  This camera, which works on children as
young as six months, takes special Polaroid photographs that show if a youngster
has a vision disorder.  The PhotoScreener test takes less than two minutes,
produces instant results, doesn't require messy eye drops or restraints and is
painless. That means that pediatricians, family physicians, eye care
professionals and health screening organizations can easily add it to their
routine testing procedures for young children.</P>
<P>
The MTI PhotoScreener takes a special photograph of a child's eyes that detect
vision problems.  Any potential disorder shows up as a crescent on the
photograph.  The PhotoScreener does not take the place of a full ophthalmic
exam; if a problem is detected, the child should receive further testing from an
eye care professional.</P>
<P>
Comprehensive research conducted by the University of Iowa proves the MTI
PhotoScreener works.  Dr. Bill Scott, author of the study, has said, "The MTI
PhotoScreener is an accurate and reliable device designed to detect amblyogenic
factors in young children.  The camera offers promise as a mass-screening
tool."</P>
<P>
Developed by a pediatric surgeon and an ophthalmologist, the MTI PhotoScreener
is now being distributed around the world.  Primary care doctors, eye care
specialists, hospitals and health screening groups are using this new FDA
cleared camera to check for vision problems in preverbal children.</P>
<P>
The product is manufactured by Medical Technology and Innovations, Inc., a
publicly traded firm based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  For more information,
