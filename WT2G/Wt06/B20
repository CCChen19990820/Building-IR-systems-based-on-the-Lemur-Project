The following individuals made helpful comments on earlier drafts of this working paper: Emily Mathis, Martha Gardner, Ingrid Liiv, Sarah Uhl, Elaine D. Gustafson, Amy Gerstein, and Phil Stone. The authors would like to thank the teachers and administrators at our eight study schools for their openness to our presence and their careful attention to multiple drafts of our work. Agreements designed to protect the individuals' and schools' identities preclude our mentioning any of them by name. We could not have done our work without their cooperation and participation; we hope that our findings are of some use to them. We realize it would not be difficult to identify the study schools, but ask that readers respect their wish for anonymity as we have. Finally, we thank the members of the Coalition Central Staff and, particularly, Ted Sizer for their willingness to allow a long-term study of the Coalition to occur.<p><a name="contents"><hr><p><h2>Table of Contents:</h2><p><ul><li><a href="#intr">Introduction</a>	<ul>	<li><a href="#tcoe">The Coalition of Essential Schools</a>	<li><a href="#tsep">The School Ethnography Project</a>	<li><a href="#tss">The Study Schools</a>	</ul><li><a href="#sfcr">Support for Coalition Reform</a>	<ul>	<li><a href="#pt">Professional Transformation</a>	<li><a href="#ptal">Personalizing Teaching and Learning</a>	<li><a href="#giot">Grassroots Involvement of Teachers</a>	<li><a href="#rtds">Reorganizing the Daily Schedule</a>	<li><a href="#sipd">Self-Initiated Professional Development Opportunities</a>	<li><a href="#anno">A National Network of Coalition-Affiliated Schools</a>	<li><a href="#mraa">More Reflection About a Vision for the School</a>	</ul><li><a href="#otcr">Oppposition to Coalition Reform</a>	<ul>	<li><a href="#sac">Skepticism about Change</a>	<li><a href="#pwsc">Problems with Specific Common Principles</a>	<li><a href="#ttte">The Threat to Electives and Jobs</a>	<li><a href="#po">Political Opposition</a>	<li><a href="#tet">The Emotional Toll</a>	<li><a href="#iw">Increased Workload</a>	<li><a href="#disi">Disillusionment</a>	<li><a href="#back">Backsliding</a>	</ul><li><a href="#rotf">Reflections on the Findings</a><li><a href="#note">Notes</a><li><a href="#refe">References</a></ul><p><a name="intr">		<hr><center><h2>Introduction</h2></center><hr>When the students are involved, they learn a lot more, and they learn a lot more from each other. There's a lot of things that are not traditional content but that can be very worthwhile experiences for students. . . . I'd say the insides of an earthworm really aren't important anymore.<p>-- <i>Biology Teacher</i><p>I have more job satisfaction this year. I mostly feel that it's because of the feedback that I get from students. These are low-level things, but they smile when they see you instead of growling. They'll talk to you. They will respond when you reach out. They want to be acknowledged and helped. They don't have that hostile veneer. . . . I'm not sure if this is because of the Essential school, but I feel a real satisfaction when I develop an activity and the kids like it, because hours and hours went into it. And that motivates a teacher to continue working hard like that.<p><i>-- Science Teacher</i><p>"The shopping mall high school" -- that's exactly the kind of high school I went to. You could take anything. Everything was offered. . . . I had a great time in high school -- and I loved every teacher I had. I had the best music teacher, the best art teachers, I really had good math, good history teachers. I had a great time in high school and it was one of those huge, three-thousand-kid high schools, but I loved it. At this school, unlike "the shopping mall high school," we have eliminated to the bone. These kids don't have anything extra. <p><i>-- Art Teacher</i><p>To a degree, "We can do better" was the statement. But I think really the message that people seemed to get was, "What you're doing is all wrong." It was a negative message rather than a positive message and it really put people on the defensive.<p><i>-- English Teacher</i><p><p><p>In this paper we provide an overview of the main reasons why teachers supported their school's efforts at educational reform through membership in the Coalition of Essential Schools. In a sample of eight study schools, the primary reasons for support were the personal transformations teachers experienced and the benefits they felt students derived from a more personalized approach to teaching and learning. <p>	Although many individual teachers supported Coalition philosophy, in most of our study schools there was no consensus regarding the need for change nor the appropriateness of Coalition philosophy. Further, some teachers -- although supportive in principle -- became opposed as they worked to implement the Common Principles in their classrooms and to shape policy schoolwide. Therefore, we also examine teachers' opposition to membership and several problems that arose at our study schools after they joined the Coalition of Essential Schools and as faculty realized what Coalition membership meant in practice. <p>	The teachers whose voices we present were selected because they represent opinions widely held across numerous school sites. To provide some context for the teachers' remarks that follow, we provide brief descriptions of the Coalition of Essential Schools, the School Ethnography Project, and our eight study schools.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcoe"><h3>The Coalition of Essential Schools </h3>The Coalition of Essential Schools was founded in 1984 by Theodore R. Sizer, former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and former headmaster at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Coalition philosophy is the product of thinking, research, and writing that emerged from A Study of High Schools, a five-year, multisite study of American secondary schools.1 Drawing on his experiences in schools and the general shortcomings he perceived in American education, Sizer wrote a compelling narrative about his findings, <i>Horace's Compromise</i>, and devised a philosophy, codified in the Common Principles (see Appendix A), which formed the basis of the Coalition. <p>	Prior to and at the time of his book's publication, Sizer and his associates made numerous speeches promoting his philosophy. Based on what he perceived as an enthusiastic reception for his ideas among the teachers and school administrators he met, Sizer recruited schools willing to experiment with his philosophy and put together a small, university-based staff to assist this effort. From an initial membership of twelve "charter" schools and a Central Staff of three persons in December 1985, the Coalition grew to include more than four hundred schools nationwide and a Central Staff of more than forty by the end of 1992. <p>	In part, this expansion resulted from a partnership called Re:Learning, which the Coalition initiated with the Denver-based Education Commission of the States (ECS), a "non-profit, nationwide interstate compact formed to help governors, state legislators, state education officials and others develop policies to improve education" (Re:Learning 1989:6). The Coalition focused on school-site reform, while ECS worked with state and local governmental agencies to create a policy environment conducive to school-site change. Most of the recent Coalition member schools joined through states that are part of the Re:Learning partnership. <p>	All of the study schools described in this paper were charter member schools and, while two are located in Re:Learning states, all of their Coalition memberships predate Re:Learning.<p>	In proclaiming the diversity of its membership, the Coalition stresses that it is a grassroots reform movement focused on improving classroom teaching and learning and helping students to "use their minds well." Unlike many reform efforts, the Coalition emphatically rejects centralized and standardized solutions to school problems. Moreover, the nine Common Principles that form the foundation of this reform are ambiguous by design: each member school is to interpret and act upon the principles within its own cultural and institutional context. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tsep"><h3>The School Ethnography Project </h3>In August of 1986, the School Ethnography Project began a multiyear ethnographic documentation and research project focused on the schools and staff that were partners in the Coalition of Essential Schools. At this time the schools were still in the initial stages of their restructuring efforts. Data collection continued until June of 1990. <p>	Specifically, our research entailed observing classes, after-school activities, planning meetings, and other school-based activities. We interviewed students, teachers, and administrators about their work, about proposed or implemented changes, and about their future plans. We conducted a survey of 1,500 students in eleven Essential schools and collected related data about the schools -- such as newspaper articles, yearbooks, and other school publications, faculty- and student-authored materials, and materials stored in Coalition archives about individual schools. <p>	Although our research focused primarily on school sites, we also attended Coalition staff meetings, conferences, and workshops; interviewed Central Staff members; and generally stayed abreast of developments within the Central Staff. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tss"><h3>The Study Schools</h3>Of our eight study schools, six were public high schools (three urban, two suburban, one rural), one was a private secondary school, and one was a newly created secondary school. All were located in eastern states. Changing demographics were at issue in most of our study schools. For example, at one school the student population fell by as much as 30 percent over the course of our research. <p>	Prior to joining the Coalition, the schools varied in their commitment to change. Only two of the eight schools had held faculty referenda on Coalition membership before joining. The other six schools joined primarily because of the initiative of the principal or superintendent. Three of the eight schools continue to be identified by the Coalition as schools that are sustaining and deepening their change efforts.<p>	Under our agreement with the study schools, we have used pseudonyms to protect the identities of the schools and their staffs.<p><h4>Barrett </h4>Barrett Preparatory School is a small, private, K-12 school in a large, multicultural metropolitan area. A strong commitment to minority recruitment on the part of the administration has meant that the sizable Greek, Italian, and Soviet Jewish populations at the school have been complemented by an increasing number of African-American students. The student body is heterogeneous in ability as well. Most students plan to attend college, and increasingly the school has placed students in desirable colleges and universities. <p>	In the spring of 1985, after consulting with interested faculty, the headmaster prepared the Barrett Educational Plan, a statement of the school's new guiding philosophy, which paralleled the Coalition's Common Principles in many ways. It was then discussed among the faculty and formally accepted by the school's Board of Trustees. Barrett joined the Coalition as one of the earliest member schools in 1985. Although initially enthusiastic, for various reasons many faculty became resistant to the changes as they were implemented. At this time, Barrett has limited involvement with the Coalition.<p><h4>Elliston </h4>Elliston High School is a suburban high school whose primary clientele are the children of executives who work in local divisions of several large corporations in a nearby city of approximately 240,000. The school district serves two neighboring communities, Elliston and nearby Parkview, whose residents often purchase homes in these towns with the expectation that their children will receive an excellent public education. Elliston is a sprawling suburban community with numerous subdivisions, in close proximity to the urban center and to several local, exclusive country clubs. Parents are actively involved in the education of their children. <p>	Elliston High School has an excellent academic reputation; the school has won numerous awards for excellence, including being ranked first in the nation in an independent survey of public high schools in 1988. The approximately 1,000-student high school offers students an array of courses, including a large selection of electives. Additionally, there are numerous "tracks" for students, intended to allow teachers to tailor their content and pace of instruction to meet students' varying needs. Most Elliston students are white, although as the school is a voluntary participant in the nearby urban center's educational opportunities program, urban students -- primarily minority (most often African-American) -- can elect to be bused to Elliston High. <p>	Many of Elliston's students expect to work hard, do well, and attend prestigious colleges and universities. Virtually all students complete high school and most (85-90 percent) pursue higher education. Elliston joined the Coalition in 1985 and spent the next three years engaged in a long, thoughtful process of determining what, if anything, it wished to change. Ultimately, the faculty decided to withdraw from the Coalition in 1989, affirming aspects of their current practice and philosophy, most particularly their commitment to comprehensive education, as they did so. <p><h4>Evans Hill</h4>Evans Hill, a small village, is one of a patchwork quilt of tiny communities in a county adjacent to a large metropolitan area and is known for its residential desirability for commuters and for its excellent school system. A walk through the hallways of the community's public school (a K-12 self-contained district) provides a sense of the community's ability to provide for their children: one sees computer labs, small classes (in 1986 the student/teacher ratio was 15-to-1 and average class size approximately twenty), a large library, several auditoriums, and a cafeteria with a short-order menu and student lounge. <p>	Evans Hill High enjoys a favorable reputation, with graduates frequently attending Ivy League universities and exclusive smaller colleges. The student population is 96 percent white, 3 percent Asian, and less than 1 percent "other." <p>	The principal and a small group of interested faculty initiated Coalition membership, but this membership was problematic from the start. Faculty resistance, coupled with the arrival of a new school administration in the midst of the change process, led those committed to Coalition ideas to feel isolated and embattled. While the school remains a Coalition member, its faculty and local community have never wholeheartedly embraced Coalition change. <p><h4>Green Valley</h4>Green Valley Junior-Senior High School is located in the town of Green Valley, which has the second lowest per capita income in an Appalachian state that provides little support for local education. The school is small, with roughly 350 students enrolled in grades seven through twelve and a staff of slightly more than thirty. <p>	While the physical plant is sparse, there is a sense of community, life, and excitement about the school. Much of what occurs at Green Valley Junior-Senior High emanates from its principal, Stuart Tucker. He came to the school in 1981 after leaving a similar position at a relatively prominent middle school. The school that he took over in 1981 had had a troubled recent history. In the late seventies, the school faced many problems, including low teacher salaries, high dropout and absentee rates (both 20 percent), and low college attendance (8 percent). When Tucker began working at Green Valley, the school had a traditional structure which he and the faculty slowly redesigned. Tucker's and the Coalition's philosophy corresponded well, and Green Valley became one of the first Coalition members in 1985. The school presently continues its membership and is often cited for its greatly improved dropout and college attendance rates.<p><h4>Lewis High School</h4>Located in a mid-Atlantic city of 750,000 residents, Lewis High is a "zoned," or neighborhood, comprehensive school2 that enrolls an entirely African-American student population of about 1,100. About three-quarters of the faculty are also African-American. <p>	In some ways Lewis fits the typical conception of an urban high school. Many school doors are locked or chained closed to restrict the flow of outsiders into the school. Classes are generally large; most enroll over thirty students. Yet, Lewis has a comfortable, "small school" feel as well. In the classrooms and hallways, students, teachers, and administrators seem at ease with one another. The school offers an array of extracurricular activities, and participating students and faculty appear enthusiastic about them. Most members of the Lewis "family" (a common descriptor of the school by those associated with it) freely acknowledge pride in their school. Although Lewis relocated for building renovations from the fall of 1988 through the spring of 1991, in its permanent location the school is unquestionably a "neighborhood school," with many families choosing to send more than one child to the school. <p>	When Lewis began its Coalition involvement in 1985, the school enrolled nearly 2,000 students. Enrollment decreased by approximately 900 students during major building renovations, precipitating a concern with job security by some faculty. <p>	In terms of our research sample, Lewis High is an interesting case: while there were four school-within-a-school (SWAS) reform efforts in our sample of study schools, Lewis was the only one that expanded its SWAS program throughout the five years of our research -- adding more students as well as faculty members to their program every year. <p><h4>Russell</h4>Russell High School, an arts and communications magnet, is one of four magnet high schools in an eastern city of 150,000 residents. Besides its magnet program, Russell offers a Coalition SWAS program, English as a second language, special education, and a traditional comprehensive program. Nearly 80 percent of the student body are minorities, a far higher percentage than in the other magnet schools in the city; falling enrollment rates at Russell in the 1970s were later offset by busing students from the low-income, multiethnic Westside. In the late 1980s, Russell's dropout rate was estimated at 40 to 50 percent, and student "course failures" numbered around 1,800 annually, or, on average, nearly two per student. <p>	Russell joined the Coalition in late 1984 following a vote in which two-thirds of the school's faculty approved starting a SWAS. Initial recruitment for the SWAS team was accomplished through an application process open to all Russell teachers. Four of the five teachers chosen were Russell veterans, and all were relieved from teaching responsibilities for a half-year to plan the SWAS program for the fall. From the beginning, the school's SWAS had ties to a local university which provided consultation services and other support. <p>	The SWAS program enrolled 104 ninth-graders in its first year (1986-87) and planned to double its numbers each year, but yearly enrollments fell below expectations, in part because some Russell programs competed for the same students. By September 1990, the SWAS program encompassed all four grades, enrolling about 290 students -- 31 percent of the approximately 950 students enrolled at Russell -- with a staff of fifteen teachers. Because of limited faculty interest and overall program expense, there are no further plans for SWAS expansion. <p>	Attendance and dropout rates have showed significant improvement in the SWAS, but there have also been problems with faculty tensions and divisiveness, ambivalence about university involvement at Russell, and specific problems with components of the SWAS design. <p><h4>Silas Ridge </h4>Silas Ridge is an eastern city of 65,000 inhabitants. Located in the heart of the city, Silas Ridge High is a comprehensive high school of slightly more than 1,000 students. Historically dominated by a middle-class, white population, the school has enrolled increasing numbers of minority students (primarily Southeast Asians and Eastern Europeans) and, owing to shifting economic circumstances, nearly half the student body qualifies for the "reduced lunch" program. Most Silas Ridge students are grouped according to a five-tier tracking system, intended to serve the needs of students headed for Ivy League educations as well as of those with little understanding of either English or the United States. <p>	In January 1985, Silas Ridge High School became a charter member of the Coalition due to the work of Katherine Shaw, a Silas Ridge teacher who would soon become the principal, and a volunteer group of teachers. The school began with a year-and-a-half-long planning phase, which involved volunteer teachers and administrators, followed by the school starting a SWAS program with a team of four teachers -- English, history, math, and science. Although the Coalition teachers themselves enjoyed the Essential school structure, philosophical and personal differences within the team complicated their efforts and, by the second year, tensions related to perceived preferential treatment of the SWAS teachers by the principal had emerged. Eventually, the SWAS was dissolved. <p>	Silas Ridge's Coalition program spent the next few years in a state of limbo. In the spring of 1990, Silas Ridge held a faculty referendum on whether to remain in the Coalition. Twenty-two persons (42 percent of those who participated) voted to continue Coalition membership. Fifteen people (28 percent) supported continued membership but felt they could not be actively involved.3 Sixteen (30 percent) felt membership should be terminated. With the SWAS program dismantled, however, Coalition reform at Silas Ridge appears limited to ad hoc planning and experimentation. <p><h4>Wade </h4>A growing number of schools are being designed and founded using the Common Principles of the Coalition as their underlying philosophy. The first and one of the most well-known of these is Wade Secondary School. Founded by Helen Markham, an educator and innovator with a history of involvement in alternative elementary school education, Wade began with approximately eighty seventh-graders in 1985. The school added one grade per year for six years until it reached its present size of approximately 450 students and graduated its first senior class in 1991. <p>	Wade is located in a large urban system which annually spent, on average, about $5,500 per pupil in the mid-1980s. While situated in an area of pov-erty, violence, and joblessness, Wade is part of a school district that is widely acknowledged to favor innovation. The district has supported the fledgling school by providing political support for it and by assisting with fund-raising. While Wade is an alternative public school and students are selected for admission, Markham has sought to maintain several balances in selecting students, including achievement and racial and socio-economic representation. Throughout our research period, the racial and ethnic mix at Wade was approximately 40 percent African-American, 35 percent Hispanic, 9 percent white, 6 percent Asian, and 10 percent biracial. <p>	The administration and staff were committed to building a multicultural faculty, and teachers, administrators, and students stressed the supportiveness, caring, and sense of shared purpose among staff and students. Students often used Coalition reform rhetoric with ease, infusing it with an active and pragmatic sense of purpose. The school's structure, curriculum, and dominant pedagogical techniques have been based on and continue to reflect the central aims of Coalition philosophy.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sfcr"><hr><center><h2>Support for Coalition Reform</h2></center><hr>Our research revealed seven reasons why teachers in our study schools advocated Coalition membership: a sense of professional and personal transformation and opportunity derived from Coalition ideas; the restructuring of school schedules that most Coalition programs initiated; the increased satisfaction that personalizing classrooms had for teachers and, in their opinions, students; the sense of having a say in the decisions that affected their professional lives; the opportunity to request and/or to design their own professional development activities; the feeling of being part of a national network of like-minded schools and educators; and the belief that their school faculties had become more reflective about their profession and their schools' character. <p>	Although unique circumstances at individual schools often engendered additional reasons for supporting Coalition reform efforts, this list provides a broad overview of the most appreciated outcomes at the study schools.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pt"><h3>Professional Transformation</h3>Many of the teachers who enthusiastically embraced Coalition philosophy discussed the professional changes they had experienced from their association with the Coalition, often stressing a sense of having more freedom to experiment than before the school's involvement in the Coalition. Often they experienced a sense of personal change as well.4 To reflect some of the many perspectives that we heard throughout our research, we have included two statements of professional transformation from our field notes. <p><h4>Sharon, a Biology Teacher</h4>Sharon, who taught biology in an urban school, described the changes she had witnessed in her students during the almost twenty years she had taught in that district -- and how a shifting student population presented her with new challenges that her more traditional approaches to teaching seemed unable to address. Sharon found that using Coalition ideas in her classroom was a positive means to address these challenges: <p><blockquote>I entered [this school district] in September 1971 with visions of teaching my students protein synthesis . . . and other intricacies of biology which I had eagerly studied as an undergraduate biology major. It was satisfying for me to observe my tenth- and eleventh-grade students -- challenged with biological concepts and motivated about the wonders of their living world -- rise to a high level of expectation in the laboratory and the classroom. Many of my students attended top-notch universities and colleges, and it was not unusual for me during the late seventies and early eighties to receive a visit or letter [saying]: "Your message in my yearbook came true! I'm a physician" or "Thanks so much for the encouragement to go to college. I'm a doctoral candidate in archaeology."</blockquote><blockquote>The pride and gratification I felt waned in the early eighties when, nationally, student proficiency in science declined . . . [and] half of all eleventh-graders thought science was not personally useful. At [my] high school, the negative attitude toward science resulted in low achievement. More than 60 percent of the students had failing grades in biology and were not electing to take advanced sciences. Academic molecular biology was of little or no interest to my urban students. "When are we going to get to the good stuff?" they would ask.</blockquote><blockquote>Isolated and frustrated in an inner-city school where security, not curriculum revision, was a top priority, I began searching for solutions. How could I teach biology so students would see it as "good stuff?" The principles of student-as-worker and teacher-as-coach lured me into an association with the Coalition of Essential Schools. I did not get answers but I was encouraged with guiding principles and a support system to search for a way to awaken the desire to learn in my students. </blockquote><blockquote>Consulting with Coalition staff and with the chorus of "This stuff is boring!" ringing in my ears, I began to design a new curriculum with the focus of relating biology to students' everyday experiences. The starting point was teaching biology thematically (e.g., unity in diversity, continuity, and interaction) while always connecting one theme to the other. . . . I have been able to create lessons which demonstrate to students that there is a very real connection between the study of biology and their own lives and that learning is a wonderfully empowering experience. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>Spending less time lecturing, I believe teachers can provide students with countless opportunities to explore the wonders of biology. Adolescents, by nature, learn better working with peers rather than in isolation. Stressing both process <i>and </i>content and providing students with appropriate active learning strategies -- cooperative learning, jigsaws (peer teaching), hands-on activities, and laboratory experiments -- our students are engaged in their learning and develop lifelong skills. My success with these strategies and the new curriculum has been rewarding; yet I know that readjustments and fine tuning are required. My profession is [again] exciting and stimulating. </blockquote>	Sharon considered her struggle to promote active and collaborative learning among her students quite worthwhile. While she was clear that her first efforts to make biology relevant and interesting to her students were not the be-all and end-all solution to addressing the needs of a changed student population, she viewed herself as reinvigorated -- a feeling that, according to her, had been lost prior to experimenting with student-as-worker and teacher-as-coach approaches. <p><h4>Fred, a Chemistry Teacher</h4>Fred, an experienced teacher who attended a Coalition workshop, was initially skeptical about whether he would find anything relevant to <i>his </i>teaching and <i>his </i>students' learning. In reflecting on his professional transformation, Fred talked about how and why he changed his approach, while acknowledging the difficulties his colleagues might have in embracing a similar approach, since they were still enmeshed in their own patterns of "business as usual."<p><blockquote>I think you can take an old-dog, traditional teacher and change him. Here you're looking at one. People almost fifty years old can be dramatically changed. . . . It's not a matter of age because . . . I've been teaching twenty-five years [and] I see this as more productive. I'm trying to change. So an old dog can be taught new tricks. But you see, I'm still relatively isolated and there's a few things I'm sharing with . . . the two other chemistry teachers [in my department] and they say, "Hey, this is good. This is interesting," you know, but all they can do is look [at] it. </blockquote><blockquote>What happens is, once you start teaching and you start following the syllabus and the textbook, you get locked into the syllabus and the textbook. . . . You get into that rut and you can't get out of it. . . . I think that's where a [Coalition] workshop, or at least a summer session, is so important. I went to the [math and science] workshop sort of indifferent. You know, I'd heard all the scuttlebutt . . . [and I said,] "Well I'm going to see what this is all about." So I applied, and I was very happy I did. About halfway through that workshop, I changed almost overnight. I said "Hey, I got the idea now. I know what is going on here." One word turned me on and that was <i>engagement</i>. </blockquote><blockquote>[Someone at the workshop asked me,] "Fred, wait a second. [Do] you understand the [Common] Principles?" I said, "No. I'm testing them, and I'm constantly challenging them." Because I constantly challenge them, I [even] bounced [some of my ideas] off Ted [Sizer the next] summer. But he came back . . . and convinced me. He gave me the argument I wanted to hear. . . . I mean I've been very satis[fied]; every time I've tested the principles, they were sound. </blockquote><h4>The Value of Transformation</h4>Most of the teachers who talked about their professional transformations were veterans with more than ten years of experience, some with as many as twenty. In our study schools, the majority of teachers who got involved in Coalition SWAS programs or participated on committees planning implementation of Coalition ideas schoolwide were experienced teachers. But they were also teachers who had begun to question whether their established approach was really working, often because they sensed a lack of engagement on the part of their students. In some schools, they had clear-cut evidence that what they had been doing previously was not reaching many students: dropout rates were high, absenteeism often higher, and disorder and violence on school property had led to the situation that Sharon described earlier, "where security, not curriculum revision, was [the] top priority." <p>	Other study schools, such as Fred's, were somewhat different: suburban, middle-to-upper-middle-class schools with virtually universal graduation and college attendance rates. These schools were not problem-free, and faculty attracted to the Coalition philosophy at these schools were usually still interested in making their students' learning more active. <p>	The individuals who embraced Coalition philosophy and worked to change their classrooms did not simply change their attitudes toward teaching -- <i>they did things differently in their classrooms</i>. Some of these developments included personalizing students' learning, reorganizing the school's schedule, and participating more actively in decision-making processes. Reflecting on the transformation that he observed in some teachers at his school, one principal commented, "The change in the approaches to teaching that occurred in a few staff members [because of Coalition membership] . . . was the most significant professional development activity that I've [ever] seen. They really transformed their approach[es] to teaching." <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ptal"><h3>Personalizing Teaching and Learning</h3>Many teachers who were actively involved with their school's efforts to implement Coalition philosophy reported considerable satisfaction from their efforts to personalize student learning, one way being the use of "advisory" periods. When asked what they enjoyed about their school's reform efforts and what most benefited their students, some teachers discussed these periods. Others, such as the teacher quoted here, felt strongly that the entire structure of their SWAS program facilitated the increased personalization that students needed.<p><blockquote>Because of the Essential school setup, the teacher's role can be more intense. You see the kids in the morning and after school. It's easy to find kids because we're all on the same floor. I actually spend more time with students now. And because you're set up to coach, you can get to know them better because you actually have daily contact with each kid rather than not getting to speak to some students during an entire class. Coaching gives you that contact. And kids need to know that you respect and like them -- that's the starting point. And respect comes in many forms: being prepared for class, making sure that the directions to an assignment are clear, and so on. I feel that I reach out to them in many ways, even just having small talks with students. </blockquote>	Many efforts to personalize student learning involved changing the class format. Teachers used cooperative learning techniques, peer editing, and other forms of group work to foster a classroom environment of trust and decency -- both between students and teachers and among students -- so that students would feel comfortable taking the risks teachers felt were necessary for more serious and consequential learning. <p><h4>Rachel, an English Teacher</h4>Rachel, a teacher in the Russell Essential school program, discussed her efforts to know her students better, the sharing that emerged among her students through their interdependence, and the sense of community that she felt this created. <p><blockquote>I know them well. They do lots of group work and [they] work on the same thing but at their own pace, so that brings them together to help each other. It's almost magical. They talk with each other about their work because they know and trust each other. </blockquote><blockquote>And I can inspire them because I know them. I know what they've read. I know what they like to read. When a student says, for example, "I can't find a book I like," I know what to recommend because I know them. I'm not sure that I'd be able to do that under other circumstances. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>For instance, I know that [one student] is learning disabled . . . and I wanted to help her as a special ed student <i>and </i>I wanted her to do the work. I don't think that I could have done what I did without knowing her as I did. When we did poetry the first quarter, I knew that she does sculpture, so I had her bring her sculpture to class and she lectured on poetry and art -- symbolism, self. She compared her work to poetry, she discussed the medium she used, she gave us a definition of art. If I didn't know her, I couldn't [have done] that. </blockquote><blockquote>[Overall,] I have more active student engagement. We do journal writing on a daily basis and group work on a weekly basis. I try to involve the whole class in discussion. . . . In the past, some kids you just stopped reaching out to. They flunked all the tests and didn't do any work, and eventually you gave up. I didn't do that this year because the kids were here every day. There's no reason to give up if they're here. If a kid only comes to school once a month, why bother? . . . [Also] there's no tension in here now; . . . kids know how to treat others in here. Certain things are understood.</blockquote><blockquote>It's not so much that [my] role has changed but [that] it has intensified. There are a lot more kids who reach out for me. Kids who ordinarily wouldn't talk to teachers now do because they know they can trust us. So now we have more of an advisory role. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>And I feel I can discuss sensitive topics with them. . . . I think it's so healthy that kids are getting to talk about things [that affect them] and [to] think about their futures. I couldn't do that if I didn't have those kids in class this year and last year. And we're using <i>Annie John </i>as the basis for the Essential school's judiciary committee. She lies in the first chapter, and I asked the kids when they first lied, and they discussed it. It takes a lot of trust to do that. You can't do that when kids come to school once a week and you don't know them.</blockquote><h4>Marjorie, a Science Teacher</h4>Teachers in the Russell Essential School program found that their efforts to personalize their classrooms meshed nicely with their efforts to promote active learning among their students. This science teacher described some new assignments that she used with her classes now that she knew their abilities better.<p><blockquote>I've really gotten to know my students and what they're capable of. . . . Knowing their abilities and expectations is helpful. I'm trying to involve students more in all kinds of activities rather than just lecturing. . . . In at least one class, students are very willing to have discussions. . . . I'm also trying to give them more "creative" assignments, . . . like having them observe some life form and keep a journal. They were to explain Mendel's Laws to someone in a letter form: "The other day I was growing these peas and I noticed this . . . " </blockquote><blockquote>[Another] difference is the kinds of questions that I ask. They're more open-ended than before. And we study topics that are related to students' lives or current issues. On tests I'm finding that they never leave questions blank. They try to express themselves. It's probably tied to the open-ended questions and students seeing that I value how they approach a problem as much as the answer they come up with. We now do topics such as AIDS, genetics, and reproduction, like the "Baby M" case and surrogate motherhood.</blockquote>	Marjorie found that her students were more diligent about their school work when she worked to connect what her students were doing in class to their lives outside school. Additionally, she felt that the tone of the class encouraged students to take risks rather than just to give up when they did not know an answer. <p><h4>The Value of Personalization</h4>Another aspect of personalizing students' educational experiences was the resulting higher levels of involvement that many teachers felt they needed to have with their students' parents. As one teacher explained: "Because the students know that their parents and teachers are involved and concerned with their education, it becomes important for them. It provides a little added pressure to do their school work." Administrators and parents themselves described to us the positive feeling parents had when their child's teachers provided knowledgeable feedback to them about the student. One administrator described a call he received from a parent after a meeting with a teacher early in the school year. <p><blockquote>The parent said what impressed him was that everyone at that meeting had a confirmation of their feeling that people at the school knew their child -- not just by name but their learning patterns and their strengths and their weaknesses and where they need to go or where they were in their achievements and accomplishments. </blockquote>	Personalization was often cited by Essential school teachers in a variety of settings as one of the more positive experiences that resulted from their Coalition work. Teachers at small schools like Evans Hill and Barrett often felt that the Coalition's goal to further personalize students' education meshed nicely with what they were already doing, but that their relationships with students were already fairly personalized. In contrast, at the larger, urban schools, such as Russell and Lewis, most efforts to personalize students' experiences had more visible effects. While teachers at these schools had often been swamped by large numbers of anonymous kids who moved through their classroom as though it were the revolving door at Grand Central Station, sharing the same group of students with a team of colleagues and having advisory periods to meet with their students meant that these teachers and students came to know each other better. <p>	Additionally, it often made them more committed to their students. They felt they could not give up and just let students fail -- which sometimes had happened when overwhelmed teachers saw no means to address pervasive problems individually. Several teachers commented that they were "much happier and much more tired" as a result of their Coalition work. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="giot"><h3>Grassroots Involvement of Teachers</h3>Another aspect of Coalition philosophy that teachers in our study sites supported was its emphasis on the need for change to come from the grassroots level, rather than to be imposed top-down. Many Essential schools viewed it as in line with Coalition philosophy to engage classroom teachers in the decisions that affected their professional lives. <p>	Teachers and administrators who felt that their programs were more grassroots than before they joined the Coalition often mentioned specific decisions they had made to illustrate their increased involvement with the daily operation of the school and their rethinking of philosophy and practice. For instance, at Barrett, where many teachers charged that the administration was top-down in planning and implementing change, individual teachers spoke with pride of the decisions they had made since joining the Coalition -- to create advisory periods, to group students heterogeneously, to design a middle school curriculum, and to review and revise the schedule annually -- and of the feeling of respect that accompanied their decisions being taken seriously. <p>	Mark, a teacher from Silas Ridge, talked of his enthusiasm about a faculty-designed professional development day:<p><blockquote>I think . . . the thing that's drawing me into the excitement of the Coalition of Essential Schools [is] our in-service day that we have coming up. It is an absolute, direct outgrowth of this school's involvement with the Coalition of Essential Schools. It is faculty making a decision on what should be done here. It is the ground-up approach, which I believe is part of the concepts. . . . And it has my total and complete and wholehearted support. </blockquote>	Joe, a teacher at Russell, described the grassroots power and concomitant sense of freedom that Russell SWAS faculty had had to design and implement their program: <p><blockquote>As teachers in the Essential school, we discover every day that we have opportunities to help students in ways that would have been impossible in a more traditional setting. This is due to new freedoms we assigned to ourselves as we designed our school. Russell Essential High School, a "school within a school," was not established by an edict from above. Rather, a planning team of five teachers was given a semester without teaching duties to develop all aspects of the school, from the curriculum to the grading system to the shape of the report card.</blockquote>	The grassroots emphasis of Coalition philosophy was deemed appropriate and appreciated by teachers who wanted to change their practice and effect schoolwide changes. While their uninvolved colleagues often felt the Coalition efforts at individual sites were not grassroots (we will discuss this perception later in the paper), those actively involved with reform generally felt it was a truly bottom-up approach with more or less support at the upper levels of district administration, depending upon the specific school. They often spoke of how the changes they had made and the opportunities to reflect on what they wanted to do gave them new energy to undertake reform and a greater appreciation of the difficulties it entailed. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rtds"><h3>Reorganizing the Daily Schedule</h3>In implementing Coalition philosophy, seven of our study schools reorganized their schedules to accommodate their school's interpretation of the Common Principles of student-as-worker and personalization. To make time for more active student learning, most schools experimented with blocks of time longer than the standard forty-five-minute period. <p>	Each school used different scheduling arrangements. Russell, for instance, had a double-period class for all subjects but scheduled them to meet every other day. Evans Hill had a double-period English/history block three or four times per eight-day cycle and separate, single periods for English and history the remaining days. Green Valley and Lewis took a different approach to achieve the same end: they provided teams of teachers with three or four back-to-back "traditional"-length periods and let them work out their own daily, weekly, or monthly allocations of subject-matter time for their shared group of students. <p>	Regardless of how larger blocks of time were created, Essential school teachers generally supported this change. They felt that these schedule changes gave them time to explore topics in greater depth, more flexibility in how they approached course material, and more opportunities to make students active learners. <p>	Andy, a teacher/administrator from Barrett, said:<p><blockquote>[T]he double period gives [teachers] a good block of time to really do something interesting and not have to rush through it, or not have to stop and continue it the next day. And I think the kids realize that they're more accountable in the seminars, so they had better prepare for that class. . . . [T]he kids are doing more of the work so the teachers are there [almost] as a resource person in many cases. It involves a lot of planning, but I just think it's a different type of energy than standing up in front of a class and talking the whole time. [And] I think it's more enjoyable, on the whole.</blockquote>	At Green Valley one team found that their approach -- weekly scheduling for the students on each team -- was so flexible that they could include exploratory work that simply had not been possible with the previous schedule. As one team member explained: <p><blockquote>Now it's easier to do what <i>I </i>want because our time is so much more flexible. We design our schedule ourselves. Since I stress hands-on experiences for my students, if I want to do fieldwork with my classes, I can. Before, I used to have to impose on other faculty members in order to get that time, but we have more freedom with the schedule now. . . . It's much easier for the people on our team to set up different sorts of experiences for our students now. If we want to go out and collect fossil samples for four hours, we can do it, without disrupting anyone else's schedule. </blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sipd"><h3>Self-Initiated Professional Development Opportunities</h3>One aspect of Coalition reform that many teachers appreciated was the opportunity to design and conduct their own professional development activities, occasionally even sponsoring such activities for other schools. For some schools, these were week-long summer workshops or weekend retreats that allowed teachers to delve into issues at length. Other schools organized activities for schoolwide in-service days.5 <p>	A Barrett teacher described the workshop his faculty held to help them design their new middle-school division as well as how the staff decided to make the middle school ungraded:<p><blockquote>[W]hat is interesting is [that] people [who] never really talked about [these issues] before, thought about [them]. We worked together and we tore and scratched and clawed and, really, it was an incredible experience to go through during that [week-long workshop last summer (in 1988)]. We hated each other at times and we loved each other, too. But we came to agreements and compromises. And people now, in the upper grades, . . . actually . . . I think after just that one week, have been lifted to the next level -- above the level of [giving] grades. [They have] realized and thought about the idea that maybe comments are more important, [that a child's] development is more important. . . . There's hope that there's a better way because no one likes to grade kids. None of us do. </blockquote>	Among our study schools, three (Wade, Lewis, and Green Valley) have continued to pursue Coalition-based reforms more actively than the others. One commonality among the three is that each offers its own professional development activities. Taking a variety of forms, these activities are regular opportunities for the staff to reflect on its work and to consider new directions. Coalition Central Staff members are often asked to participate in professional development efforts. Their participation supports and develops strong ties between these schools and the Central Staff. <p>	A Green Valley teacher reflected on the multiple benefits of a three-day in-service program that their faculty conducted for another school system:<p><blockquote>At first, I was scared to even go. I thought that the older teachers at this conference wouldn't listen to me. But we ended up making very good connections with the teachers there. We still keep in touch [a half-year after the summer workshop]. . . . I really felt as though I absorbed a lot. </blockquote><blockquote>We staged a "planning session" for these teachers and brainstormed a unit for them so that they could see how we design our curriculum. After they saw how we had done it, we had them do it. . . . We started the whole workshop with a session entitled "The Problems of Teaching." But, as we were going through that, we found that some of the teams weren't even established yet. So we backtracked for them and they became more comfortable. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>The main thing that we brought to that workshop was our experience from Green Valley High. We talked about the support administration could offer as well as what it means to be part of a teaching team and how teams operate. </blockquote>	Another Green Valley teacher discussed how the experience had influenced her own professional development and self-reflection:<p><blockquote>Before going [to do the workshop] we did a good deal of reading -- Sizer, Boyer, Goodlad, <i>Shopping Mall High School</i>. We also did our own workshops in preparation, even though what we developed at Green Valley we had to change during the workshop. We also thought about how we devised our teams' "essential questions" and how we could help other teams do the same. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>Before we did the workshop, I knew very little about essential questions -- now, I'm doing lectures for student teachers at [a local college]. I did one lecture on essential questions and the next one I'm going to do is on "the first year of teaching." [Our principal] set it up. He told me to think about what I should have learned in college but didn't and then to focus on that. </blockquote>	Teachers at these three schools often talked about how their professional development activities prepared them not only for working with their own students but also for assisting other schools (or groups) to rethink their practices or philosophy. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="anno"><h3>A National Network of Coalition-Affiliated Schools</h3>Another aspect of Coalition membership that many teachers found beneficial was the sense of being part of a larger network of like-minded individuals -- teachers, researchers, administrators, and others -- interested in nurturing and sustaining school/educational change. <p>	People at our study schools mentioned two specifically useful components of this network. First, the Coalition Central Staff (or consultants to them) sometimes visited schools to provide feedback on schoolwide and classroom-based experiments. <p>	A teacher from Silas Ridge High School, which worked periodically with a Coalition consultant, described the effect his presence had, particularly when school-based opposition seemed to be undermining change efforts.<p><blockquote>[W]hen we were having trouble working together, James came and he really got us back on track. . . . [H]is stay here was really a turning point. The Coalition Steering Committee at that point had members who were really opposed to the SWAS model and there were a lot of people [on the committee] and we weren't able to find a middle ground. Yet we had a sense that there must be a middle ground, that there must be some things that we really did agree upon. James helped us see some of those areas. </blockquote>	Roy, a teacher in Russell's Essential school, described the supportive assistance and encouragement he felt was offered by a Coalition staff member. Not only did the staff member work with the two-person team as they tried to plan and teach a new unit on mythology, but she also offered some financial support for the team's experimentation. <p><blockquote>So while [another teacher] was doing a unit on myths, I started with the Greeks and Romans [in Western Civ]. When the Central Staff heard about what we were doing, they came to us. . . . [T]hey really believed in this approach, and they were willing to give us time to plan outside of class. We met three times with [one Central Staff member]. She's a real motivator. She made us feel like the idea could work. She was enthusiastic, but she didn't tell us how to do it. And when we didn't follow all of the nine Common Principles from <i>Horace's Compromise</i>, it wasn't a problem. . . . She gave us confidence. She said, "Do it. It's a good idea." She wasn't some phony telling us, "Oh, this is wonderful!" </blockquote>	The second way that teachers at our study schools benefited from the network of member schools came from conferences and workshops. One teacher described the feeling of excitement at being part of a lively exchange of ideas about what to do to improve student learning.<p><blockquote>I had the most exciting experience at the workshop. . . . It was such fun to have people say, "You have good ideas" and people wanting, . . . really starving for, ideas. . . . [T]he sharing that went back and forth [was great]. I felt that the workshop was very well prepared and well done and very, very worthwhile.</blockquote>	Another teacher described the enthusiasm that existed at a summer workshop she attended and how helpful it was to know that the network of involved teachers and schools was expanding. <p><blockquote>It was wonderful. . . . I met wonderful people from across the country. That was another thing that I really liked about the summer workshop: . . . I saw the same kind of enthusiasm from people from Arizona and California and Oregon. And it was . . . nice to know that it wasn't this small movement. It seems to really -- hopefully -- continue to generate . . . enthusiasm.</blockquote>	Other teachers -- especially those from schools where Coalition support was limited -- described the positive "energy" they felt personally when they realized that many others were struggling with the same questions as they were. The sense of a group of like-minded individuals contemplating and enacting changes was a novelty to them. For instance, Larry from Elliston High School said, "I was recharged [at workshops and conferences] thinking about what could be, knowing that other people [were] struggling with the same questions. . . . It made a world of difference."<p>	In sum, many teachers found the Central Staff and people from other Coalition schools to be powerful supports for them. They cited personal and schoolwide benefits resulting from the ability to draw on this network of individuals and schools. And they repeatedly mentioned the important functions of Coalition gatherings -- to provide support and encouragement, to exchange ideas, and to get a sense for the expansion of the Coalition's work around the country. This sense of being part of something larger was particularly important for pro-Coalition teachers in schools such as Evans Hill, Elliston, Silas Ridge, and Barrett, which were experiencing difficulties achieving consensus about the need to change at the individual school site. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="mraa"><h3>More Reflection abouta Vision for the School</h3>Teachers and administrators in at least half of our study schools also talked about how the discus-sions about educational philosophy, theory, and practice that accompanied Coalition membership had served as effective mechanisms to help define a vision for their school as a whole. In each case teachers stressed the importance of the principal's leadership in bringing the Coalition to the school and in supporting efforts to learn about Coalition philosophy and determine how to implement it at their school. Teachers at all of our study sites con-trasted their present state, which many described as purposeful, if still unfolding and somewhat chaotic, with previous conditions which had been mechanical, unthinking, and lacking a sense of shared purpose. As a Barrett teacher remarked: <p><blockquote>[Before the current principal,] . . . it was a little chaotic. . . . With Mrs. Washington, I don't think we had a direction. With Dr. Winters, yes, we do have a direction. We do have the Barrett Plan [the school's definition of the Common Principles] in full swing now. I don't know the benefits yet, [but] I think they [will be] long-term. As I see it now, I feel it's an important plus and a positive [change].</blockquote>	Reflecting on his principal, a Green Valley teacher discussed how the principal's vision and determination had transformed the school:<p><blockquote>I have three kids. They are my top priority. He has 320. They're his top priority. . . . Stuart Tucker gets the most of the people he has working for him. His life is consumed with it. He's a benevolent monarch. He is the energy behind the school. . . . He's always pushing for the teachers and superintendent to get better. He won't allow his family of 320 to be ignored. . . . We're now moving toward having exhibitions for the entire school, portfolios in all classes, designing exit-level skills for our students. . . . He's always pushing teachers to do extra summer work with money that he finds somewhere. . . . We're on the cutting edge because of Stuart's leadership. We're doing much more than just teaming. We have an advisor-advisee system and an apprenticeship program.</blockquote>	Finally, no matter how contentious things became at our study sites, teachers and administrators (both pro-Coalition and opposed to it) told us that their school's membership in the Coalition had made faculty as a whole more reflective about their work in their schools and their mission as teachers. Teachers reported that they were examining their own approaches in the classroom and were enthusiastic about the increased roles that shared decision making offered them. For instance, some mentioned that they had joined committees to investigate alternative governance structures for the school; others were examining possible budget reallocations or alternative ways to assess students. <p>	As one teacher from Elliston High School -- the study school that eventually voted to leave the Coalition -- explained: <p><blockquote>I think [discussions about our Coalition affiliation] made a lot of teachers look at what they were doing in the classroom and how they were presenting their material. . . . The Coalition got us talking about what we want out of education and what direction we should be going in. [And] that was extremely healthy. . . . [We] do have people doing a lot of things right now. Which makes it difficult to get people together to talk about educational reform. But we <i>are </i>talking about reform in our building right now. We're talking about a governance reform. We do have people actively involved in a budget committee, which is new. It was new last year but teachers are getting more input into how the money the high school receives is going to be spent. And we have people involved in [an] academic honesty [committee].</blockquote>	Another Elliston teacher felt that while there had been problems at her school, Coalition membership had "made people more reform-minded and open to new ideas. [And] it did stimulate an awareness that some reforms are necessary, that things are not all wonderful here." A teacher who taught at a school where there were enormous controversies about what, if anything, needed to change as a result of that school's consideration of the Common Principles also felt that even in this contentious environment the conversations were beneficial: "[W]e have had the best discussions -- the best arguments, the best rethinking. I mean people never used to talk about what they were doing in the classroom." <p>	Teachers felt there were compelling reasons for their schools to be members of the Coalition. They enjoyed belonging to a network of schools that were exploring the same ideas. They felt they and their students benefited from the professional development work -- workshops, conferences, retreats, and in-service days -- that they often designed to address their specific concerns and needs. And generally, they felt satisfaction from knowing their students better, working to make their classrooms more personalized and more active places for their students, and from having the opportunity to experiment with change. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="otcr"><hr><center><h2>Opposition to Coalition Reform</h2></center><hr>Opposition to the Coalition was part of the talk about school reform we heard during our research, emerging for myriad reasons and in a variety of forms. These included skepticism about the need for change, fear that elective courses would be eliminated if Coalition philosophy were fully implemented, philosophical opposition to specific principles, and concerns about the administration's role in the Coalition reform. <p>	In addition to opposition from the outset, other difficulties emerged as a consequence of involvement in the Coalition. For instance, many teachers who were initially indifferent to or mildly skeptical of Coalition philosophy became stridently opposed to their school's Coalition-related efforts when implementation of Coalition ideas affected them in ways that they had not envisioned. Some of their voices are included in this section. Other voices are those of pro-Coalition teachers who encountered problems as they began to initiate their reforms. Some felt overwhelmed by the work, and others found that the knowledge of their students they acquired through personalizing their relationships with students was emotionally overwhelming. Still others became disillusioned with new expectations, resistant students, and political controversies that swirled around (or embroiled) them. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sac"><h3>Skepticism about Change</h3>Many teachers and administrators in our study schools did not think that their schools or their teaching needed to change. Those who saw no need for reform often were willing to allow other teachers to experiment with change, but they themselves had neither the time nor inclination to experiment. Their refrain sounded much like this: "They can try what they want, but they can't (or better not) dictate to me what I need to do." <p>	The three most frequently raised objections to implementing Coalition philosophy were: "It can't be done"; "We already do that";6 and "This too will pass." The "It can't be done" response was usually linked in some way to a set of societal and/or institutional problems that constrained the school's and the faculty's effectiveness in achieving its mission, particularly in schools characterized by poor attendance, low standardized test scores, and high dropout and failure rates. <p>	If there was any consensus regarding the need for change at these schools, it was that the larger society needed to change because present social conditions (e.g., single-parent families, poverty, drug abuse, general disrespect for authority) made it extremely difficult for successful teaching to occur.7 One teacher at an urban school discussed his concerns about his school's Coalition program and his belief that societal change must precede school change:<p><blockquote>Sometimes, from my experience personally, my own observations, I see that these innovations lack substance . . . because they're done in a vacuum. . . . I'm sure the people who did the planning for the [Coalition program] are serious people and conscientious people act[ing] in the best interest of change, but first of all, is it trying to thread the eye of a needle with a camel? . . . Is it a societal problem? Is it society that has to be changed and [then] the school will do its job of educating or is the school supposed to change society? </blockquote><blockquote>It goes back to basic educational theory. And right now, I see it as a societal problem. . . . [S]chool is a reflection of society as it is, and education is overwhelmed by society, not the other way around. . . . Changing a curriculum is doing things in reverse. . . . Society after 2:30 is not conducive to reading and studying. . . . </blockquote>	The "I already do it" response also impeded the development of schoolwide consensus about the need for reform. Often teachers in the programs that viewed themselves as most threatened by Coalition reforms saw themselves as already "doing it." Reflecting on a week-long summer workshop developed by her school's Coalition faculty, and echoing a reaction we heard from many elective teachers, a business teacher said: "I came to the workshop, took a week out of my summer vacation, because I knew I was going to come and hear something so different, so profound -- and I didn't. I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know or that we weren't already doing."<p>	Pro-Coalition teachers often found this reaction frustrating. As one said, <p><blockquote>As we did more and more activities and [there was] more and more exposure, teachers were thinking, "Yeah, well, I do that." And then it [reached] the point of, "Well, I do it, so why do we need the Coalition? I'm doing it." </blockquote>	Through exchanges such as these, pro-Coalition teachers slowly came to realize that whether or not they intended it, their rhetoric about the need for change sent a negative message to their less interested or opposed colleagues. Advocating change seemed to implicitly criticize the status quo regardless of intent. Furthermore, being an advocate for school change seemed to preclude approaching the topic of change neutrally. <p>	Pro-Coalition teachers were vested in viewing change as improvement, and they were commonly perceived as judgmental by others less supportive of the Coalition. As one teacher explained: <p><blockquote>And I have noticed yet again what I noticed the first day I . . . ever taught here. The idea that we can be taught to teach better implies that we're not teaching very well now. And I think I'm always trying to learn, not because what I'm doing isn't any good or could be better, but because I want to learn. . . . </blockquote>	The third objection, the jaded "We've seen it all before" and "This too will pass," also impeded the development of a consensus about the need for change. As one veteran teacher explained: "[My school] is known for catching every new program coming down the road. So you have all these little spurts and starts and everybody gets energized and they get left. It gets dropped after a year or so." Or, as another teacher noted, a common reaction by her colleagues was: "This is just another fad that's coming through and we don't have to jump on every bandwagon -- just let me teach."<p>	Many problems discussed in the rest of this paper stem from this skepticism about or rejection of the need for change in schools. Those supporting reform in our study sites, after as much as seven years of Coalition membership, were more aware of the lack of consensus within their schools. Questions are now raised about how to "deal with" those who are opposed to change. As one teacher said: <p><blockquote>Hopefully [we can come] . . . to some kind of synthesis so everybody can somehow participate in what's going on in their own way . . . without having it forced [down] their throat. There are teachers, as you know, in every school that are never going to buy some of the things that the Coalition [stands for]. . . . And you can't get rid of those teachers. Obviously. And maybe we don't want to get rid of those teachers, but you also can't force them to believe in a philosophy they don't believe in. Or to teach by theories they don't feel comfortable with. Somehow I feel we have to include them, make them feel good about themselves, and value for what they're doing and still be able to remain a Coalition school working on the principles.  </blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pwsc"><h3>Problems with SpecificCommon Principles </h3>In addition to general questioning about whether change was necessary or appropriate, other teachers took exception to specific Common Principles. Universal goals, less-is-more, teacher-as-generalist, student-as-worker, and intellectual focus were the most contentious principles at our study schools, although occasionally teachers also questioned the feasibility of lowering the student-to-faculty ratio to 80:1 and the likelihood of true reform without increasing their school's budget by more than 10 percent. Teachers supportive of the Coalition also raised questions about specific Common Principles, particularly when they felt their efforts were stymied by resistance from students, colleagues, parents, and administrators. <p><h4>Universal Goals</h4>One fundamental premise of Coalition philosophy is that the goals of a Coalition program should apply to all students (CES 1985; see also Appendix A). Yet, after some schools implemented Coalition programs, some faculty challenged whether the program met the needs of <i>all </i>students. Noninvolved faculty typically voiced concerns that Coalition faculty were soft on fundamentals when there was an obvious need to emphasize structure and the "basics." As one teacher, speaking of the student population generally, remarked, "Our students are leaving this school not knowing how to read, write, and count. . . . There does not seem to be as much structure as I think students should have." Another teacher who shared this point of view commented specifically about the Essential school program: "I think our students need discipline and, from my observation, I don't see the discipline [in the SWAS program]."<p>	As time passed, some teachers within Essential school programs also began to question whether setting universal goals for all students was an appropriate or realistic expectation. Some wondered whether all students were prepared for the program's demands. Those in the Essential school programs who questioned this principle usually did so based on their experiences with students who did not respond to teachers' attempts to motivate them. After teaching in an Essential school program for a year, one teacher offered these impressions:<p><blockquote>There are some kids who just don't belong. The Essential school is not for everybody. Some kids treat the program like a joke. We should probably just give students a certain number of chances, but how many do you give? All students are entitled to fail but if it's repetitious, we need to address it because it can hinder those involved in the program. I had some of those kids in class, and they became clowns because they were so far behind in their work. We need something different for them because they can intimidate other students. </blockquote><blockquote>In sophomore English, I was to teach the process of doing a research paper. It's tough to make that interesting but it is an essential skill. Seventy-five percent of the students responded well. I introduced students to the <i>Reader's Guide</i>, but this one student was cutting my class and now she's not done. What do I do? I tried to encourage her to do the work but it's hard to do. She thinks I'm unfair.</blockquote><h4>Intellectual Focus</h4>	In some schools, faculty feared that by adopting an "intellectual focus," as the Common Principles urged, schools would restrict students' choices and require them to take a program with a strictly academic orientation. This issue became a major point of contention for Elliston High School, as their principal explained: <p><blockquote>[T]hose groups that weren't dealing with the mainstream <i>academic </i>purpose of schooling . . . felt the most threatened by the Coalition principles. . . . And one of the key issues . . . [here] was . . . the question of whether or not we were going to be a comprehensive high school.</blockquote>	A vocational teacher from a different school made a similar point when discussing his sense of being excluded from the change process:<p><blockquote>My concern about the Essential school program is that it does not appear to me that there's total school involvement. . . . And once you start with a school-within-a-school concept, the total structuring of the program does not seem to involve vocational education, and that's my field. And it's my interest. And it isn't that I don't think that students are [or should be] academically oriented, but they should receive everything that we offer as a school.</blockquote>	The most common complaint by non-Coalition teachers about the principle of "intellectual focus" was that their school's Coalition efforts were directed toward the college-bound. Some even considered the programs "college prep." While teachers generally considered such a course of study appropriate for the college-bound, some felt strongly that forcing other students into an academically oriented program did them a disservice, especially if they were unlikely to attend college. Instead, these teachers maintained, schools should continue to offer these students vocationally oriented programs. One teacher from an inner-city high school elaborated on this reservation:<p><blockquote>My concern is that every child in [my] high school is not going to college. We know this. And yet the [Coalition] program is set up strictly academic with little or no room for electives. And [in the neighborhoods] where our students come from, most of these students go to work [after high school]. They're looking for immediate employment. We would like to see them do something other than fast food, which is fine to a point, but once they graduate it hurts to see them slinging hamburgers when they could be operating a computer. But they must be proficient in those areas. They must have marketable skills. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>We have to remember where our students come from and the type of training we must give them -- and I don't feel like we are meeting their needs. There are so many things that our students have not been exposed to and I just don't think we are preparing them for the real world.</blockquote><h4>Less-Is-More</h4>Teachers' primary objection to the Coalition's principle concerning "less-is-more" was the time it took to delve into the detail that led to the mastery Sizer suggested secondary students should attain. One teacher described a typical response to suggestions that teachers should concentrate on making certain that students learn a few things well -- the most essential aspects of their field. "Everybody . . . said, 'Well I'd love to do more project work. I'd love to have them do more library work. But it takes time and I don't have time.'"<p>	Other teachers maintained that the less-is-more approach sometimes handicapped students in other, related courses. The history teacher quoted below, who attempted some aspects of less-is-more in his classroom, was skeptical of the less-is-more approach his students' teacher from the previous year had adapted. He found the students ill-prepared and turned off by the in-depth work they had done. This teacher's objection did not address the basic idea behind Coalition philosophy but rather to its particular execution thus far at his school.<p><blockquote>[For example,] less-is-more in American history. . . . [T]he kids weren't learning anything at all. Last year . . . I had them as juniors and they said "Oh, we never covered it. We don't remember it." And I can tell when certain kids say, "Oh no, we never had it" because they're bullshitting you. These kids were really in the dark. For example, they [had] never heard of the closing of the frontier. This whole idea of Manifest Destiny and the frontier, they weren't aware of it. That's wrong. . . . [But they had] weeks and weeks and weeks with video . . . on the Dred Scott case. And those kids remembered the Dred Scott case -- there's no question about it. But the [teachers] got so hung up on the fact that they had all the time in the world; it was over a month, I think. Dred Scott, Dred Scott, Dred Scott. The kids were turned off. They were bored. And they are weak on pretty much [everything] else. So less-is-more up to a point. </blockquote><blockquote>Less-is-more is actually an architectural term. And it referred to this minimalism stuff. But the architects, all of them, know that if the building doesn't comply to certain mathematical specifications, then it's going to fall down. So that's what we didn't do. . . . Some [faculty] didn't figure out you had to have fundamental, not essential, but fundamental structural elements to have it mean anything at all. . . . Then you could use Coalition methodology. And they just didn't get it.</blockquote><h4>Teacher-as-Generalist</h4>The principle of teacher-as-generalist proved particularly problematic when teachers were asked to teach outside of their specialty or when teachers perceived that they might be asked to take on new and unfamiliar roles. As one teacher recalled: <p><blockquote>It was [becoming] clear to people that their role [might] change, they wouldn't be able to do the same thing they have done for the last twenty-five years . . . but they would be working with students in a different way. And terms like "coaching," [and] "change of roles" were very stressful.  </blockquote>	Many teachers were torn: they understood and accepted the importance of emphasizing the skills that students needed to acquire and yet wished to retain a disciplinary focus to their work. For many secondary school teachers, their professional identity is closely associated with their discipline -- even more so at times than with being a teacher. <p><h4>Student-as-Worker/Teacher-as-Coach</h4>Fewer teachers expressed reservations about the fifth principle, that of student-as-worker, teacher-as-coach. One teacher voiced concerns about student-as-worker pedagogy that were commonly raised by skeptical teachers:<p><blockquote>The student-as-worker idea -- great idea, assuming again that my students weren't working before I read <i>Horace's Compromise</i>. My students did a lot of work. I had some really rough students in an eleventh-grade history class who got turned on to the labor movement. They saw it as iconoclastic and, boy, did we get a lot of work out of them. So my students [have often been] workers. </blockquote><blockquote>And [about] the assumption . . . [that] the students aren't working if they're listening to a lecture. . . . I've had lectures with some pretty heavy-duty professors. I remember this Marxist woman at [my] university. I had no idea what she was talking about. I was nineteen years old. I sat there and I hung on every word, sweating bullets trying to get it all down and make sense out of it. I was working like crazy. So they assume [that students aren't working during a lecture] and they're wrong. Lectures can be highly provocative. </blockquote><blockquote>I'm the leader here. I'm the one who's guiding them where they've never been before. And presumably -- at least I assume -- I know the salient questions about the progressive period. Now asking questions is a part of critical thinking and I've always asked the kids to ask questions, and we've always done that. And some of them we do answer. But I'm not going to do what that teacher [at one Essential School] did and ask them what they think the main issues of sociology are before taking any sociology or taking one course. Have them ask these questions, then base a whole course on that? That's crazy.</blockquote>	This same teacher explained how more traditional approaches also had their place.<p><blockquote>I really do understand what they mean by student-as-worker: they don't want these passive students. But they overreacted completely when they said, "No teacher-centered, no lecture." Obviously that's a huge error. . . . Now if [students] go all the way through high school and never hear lectures, that's a disservice. It's irresponsible. And I suspect that originally student-as-worker simply meant getting the kids more involved.</blockquote>	This teacher, like many others, had reservations about giving up his role as a knowledgeable authority in the classroom. While he cited professional responsibility, enjoyment of his craft, and the desire to share his knowledge and understanding of subject matter as reasons for resisting a wholesale adoption of student-centered instruction, other teachers described their opposition to student-as-worker philosophy as rooted more in a concern about giving up control of one's classroom, no matter how temporarily, to the students. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tson"><h3>The Socialization of New Teachers </h3>Not only were there questions about whether people fully understood and agreed with Coalition philosophy initially, but similar concerns arose as Essential school programs expanded. For instance, schools usually provided time for those first involved with their Coalition effort to plan and create a structure for their program, to develop curricula, to attend relevant conferences (often CES-sponsored), and generally to familiarize themselves with Coalition philosophy. This often involved some release time from teaching and/or funding for summer work. <p>	However, of those teachers who joined their school's Coalition program later, none were provided release-time from teaching to explore Coalition philosophy, and the introductions they did receive were usually less in-depth and less comprehensive than those given to their veteran colleagues. <p>	Further, as Coalition programs evolved, so did the day-to-day logistics of running a special program. At two schools this became such a pressing issue that the orientations provided new faculty stressed the logistical operation of the program, not the philosophical or pedagogical side of their work. As one teacher who joined her SWAS in its third year explained, this focus disappointed her:<p><blockquote>They were frustrating. We just organized our students by their math groups. I expected more about how I should be different. Other than planning that, it didn't seem different. I was looking for how this would be different for me -- how [teaching in the Essential school] affects curriculum, philosophy, and teaching style too -- and none of that happened. All we discussed were [grades] and grouping students.</blockquote>	At times the socialization process was complicated by the tendency of certain disciplines (particularly math and science) to perceive themselves as less adaptable to Coalition practices than others. Concerns with "coverage" sometimes inhibited teacher experimentation, as did an uncertainty about how to make their students more active learners in these disciplines. <p>	Andy, a teacher/administrator at one Coalition school, discussed the problems he felt math teachers at his school encountered when trying to adapt Coalition philosophy to their classrooms:<p><blockquote>I still would say the math people may not be all that happy about the [double-period schedule]. I still think they're holding on to those one-period lectures where they can present the information because I don't think the math people or the math classes, in some cases, have been all that successful in using those double-period seminars, having the kids really doing the work. A lot of times it's almost the same as the lecture class, just a smaller version of it, so they really haven't seen the benefits of getting the kids to do [active] work. They haven't been using group problem-solving techniques and stuff like that. </blockquote><blockquote>So I think if they [had] more planning and really [sat] down and [came] up with some interesting ideas for the kids to do in those two periods, I think, then, they would realize, or hopefully they would realize, that that was a good use of time, that [it] was more effective teaching.</blockquote>	Another factor that may have influenced the socialization of later Coalition faculty related to the reasons some teachers joined Coalition programs. At some study schools, teachers looking for a job knew that their chances would improve if they were willing to participate in the school's Coalition program. Thus, teachers might agree to team or teach collaboratively when they actually had little experience with, or even interest in, such pedagogy. In other instances, teachers already at a school perceived that it was in their best interest to affiliate with a Coalition program -- otherwise, they might be transferred or lose a desirable position they had earned. <p>	While these persons were not necessarily poor teachers, their understanding of and receptivity to Coalition philosophy varied from those who joined because of a philosophical affinity. Conversely, the ability to retain pro-Coalition teachers at the school was an area of concern in at least four of the eight study schools, all of which lost population throughout the late 1980s.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ttte"><h3>The Threat to Electives and Jobs</h3>One of the more pervasive reasons for opposing the Coalition was the perception among noninvolved faculty that implementing a Coalition program would adversely affect elective or magnet programs. Some schools, such as Barrett, saw immediate reductions in the scheduling of non-core courses for the entire school. This usually led to a rejection of Coalition ideas by teachers who felt their discipline was being discredited. Two quotes -- from a foreign language teacher and an art teacher, respectively -- represent comments commonly made about the perceived emphasis on core courses at Coalition schools or in Essential school programs.<p><blockquote>The first year, I think it was exciting because a lot of ideas were being thought about, about how we could be at the forefront of educational reform. I only found out later on that languages, my area, really is on the periphery. . . . We were more or less tacked onto the schedule and, as a result, we've been the last department to be programmed for the last couple of years, because the core subjects took precedence. . . . I've read the books that also gave, more or less, birth to the [Coalition] and, really, languages aren't important in any of them.</blockquote><blockquote>Art moved, to . . . one day a week. It is two periods back-to-back -- it's the double period. . . . What we're talking about is two forty-five-minute periods, an hour and a half, which was really like an hour period by the time they set up their stuff, [then] clean up and everything. They're working for an hour. In my opinion it is not enough art. Something had to go and the focus is on English, history, math, and science, and it always has been . . . </blockquote>	Elective teachers sometimes feared their jobs would be lost as their courses were phased out, or that they would be expected to teach outside their areas of specialization. Magnet programs, too, felt threatened by Coalition philosophy and the establishment of Coalition programs. Often the scheduling requirements were such that students could not participate in both programs, causing competition for students. <p>	At one Coalition school with an arts magnet, a teacher from that program wrote a letter to the school's entire faculty, pursuing his concerns about the effects of the school's Essential school program on the school's arts magnet.<p><blockquote>Since [our school] is an arts magnet school, there should be a representative from the arts magnet within the group of the "holy four" (English, history, math, and science). If [our school] is to continue offering a magnet program, it must not be weakened for the sake of artificial reform. . . . </blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="po"><h3>Political Opposition</h3>As we have seen, Coalition efforts often encountered substantial philosophical opposition from faculty members who disagreed with various Coalition tenets. Such philosophical differences frequently served to solidify and create political divisions. Three main issues proved particularly divisive: assertions that Coalition faculty received preferential treatment, the question of who had the right to make decisions -- phrased by one Coalition faculty member as "Who owns the school?" -- and accusations that the effort was merely another top-down, administrative mandate, this time somewhat disguised as grassroots. <p><h4>Equity</h4>Looking back on his school's effort, a Coalition participant offered some advice on how to avoid problems in program implementation, demonstrating at the same time how questions of equity were a common political issue:<p><blockquote>[My advice would be] to get the whole faculty in on the planning of it. Make them totally aware of what the goals are, and the philosophy; . . . somehow allow those who want to participate, free participation. And in the actual carrying out of the program somehow equalize the teachers as far as their duties and their time -- that seemed to be a prime sticking point [here]. A lot of people didn't know what was going on. A lot of people didn't care what was going on. They looked at it more or less from a selfish aspect. They said, "OK, these people have this time off, we don't. So that program is no good." I don't ever recall anyone saying the idea behind the [Coalition program] was not a good idea, just in the mechanics of it, it just didn't work out.</blockquote>	In some cases equity issues were "grieved" by the teachers' unions -- a situation that usually increased the distance between the pro-Coalition faction and the rest of the school, no matter what the outcome. At one school teachers grieved the issue of seniority and the SWAS's right to "special program" status. One teacher explained:<p><blockquote>My teachers did grieve. They formed committees. They went to the union. But it was my understanding that it was the right . . . of the principal to select the teachers that he needed for special programs. We had a teacher here who was a superior, outstanding, hard-working teacher who had seniority in the English department. She grieved and she took it to the furthest step because she wanted to be a part of the [larger school] program here. . . . She wrote letters requesting the opportunity to be a part of it. I would say it was probably a conflict in personalities as to why she was not given that job. She was moved out. And they retained an individual in the Coalition of Essential Schools program who was the lowest of seniority in the department simply because he was a coach. . . . </blockquote><blockquote>Fairness in selection, I think that should be one top priority. That means if I have a teacher in my department who is a good teacher, who is doing what she should be doing, and she has seniority, she should be retained. This teacher was heartbroken and she still is.</blockquote><h4>"Who Owns the School?"</h4>At some of our study schools, political opposition emerged partly because some faculty felt that they were excluded from the restructuring process. They saw changes occurring around them and they were beginning to sense their effects, but they felt that they had little input into the nature of those changes. In the opinion of one non-Coalition faculty member, it was precisely this sense of being left out, of having no say in the changes that were affecting the school, that motivated many faculty to begin questioning the school's efforts:<p><blockquote>Essentially, I think we had a backlash that was . . . cast in terms of "Who owns the school?" I think that a portion of the faculty . . . felt threatened, not because they were bad teachers but because of this sense that ownership of the school would have to be shared or, even possibly, in their perception, given over to someone else. That was a very deep threat to this group on the faculty. . . . And by ownership, I really mean a sense of ownership -- like property -- that "This is my school. My niche is here. I identify with this school. I don't ever plan to be a teacher anywhere else. . . . "</blockquote><blockquote>I don't consider the bulk of [the teachers who opposed the program] to be unprofessional or people who are opposed to growth. But I think it's really important that they have a sense of control over the growth [of the program] and that they not feel as if someone else is going to tell them how they have to change or how much time they have to put in. And I think that there were fairly sincere efforts to include everybody and communicate, but there were internal problems [in the Essential school] . . . that forced a lot of internal struggling to go on, that took away energy that we might have spent dealing with those people who felt on the outside.</blockquote>	In many instances, those faculty who came to oppose their school's Coalition affiliation were, at first, indifferent toward the effort. Yet, as some of those initially unconcerned about these reform efforts, or even supportive of the ideas <i>in theory</i>, began to realize the full ramifications of these changes <i>in practice</i>, what seemed like a good idea or, at worst, a harmless experiment became the basis for substantial contention. Moreover, the efforts of Coalition proponents often came to be perceived as more interpersonally confrontational than anything most Coalition supporters initially envisioned. <p>	These tensions were heightened by the tendency of Coalition supporters to be persons who, prior to their Coalition involvement, wielded little power within the school. Often they were inexperienced teachers or relatively new to their school, and many were women. Relative to their previous status, these persons began to influence school life much more than they ever had prior to the introduction of the Coalition program. And, as disinterest evolved into opposition, Coalition proponents were often caught off-guard and felt somewhat overwhelmed -- trying to address political issues that arose as well as pursuing the reform agenda that they had established for themselves.<p><h4>Resistance to Top-Down Changes </h4>Although some Coalition administrators were able to enlist the support of virtually their entire faculty, it was more common that teachers were at least somewhat suspect of their principal's motives for attempting to implement Coalition changes. Most often, their distrust took the form of accusations that program implementations were too "top-down." That is, that the principal had an agenda and was promoting that agenda, even if in public that principal described the program as grassroots. When discussing why faculty members were hesitant to criticize the Coalition program in her school, one non-involved teacher bluntly stated: "Because they know this is 'the baby of the boss.'" Discussing her school's Coalition program, a faculty member who came to oppose the effort noted how, in her view, the principal used her position to sway the faculty: <p><blockquote>[The principal] seemed to have this grant money that she held over our heads and said if we vote quickly, we can have this money. If we joined the Coalition, everything would be great. And we don't want to prevent anybody from having new ideas and having an opportunity to spend all this money and do things differently. So if you were against this initial idea, you were against people trying new ideas. And who was? Nobody was.</blockquote>	Perceptions that Coalition programs were being forced upon a faculty by a pro-Coalition administration were often worsened by ill feelings that already existed between faculty and administration.8 At some schools, it was known that certain faculty would oppose the Coalition effort solely because of their dislike for the principal. Some teachers had developed such poor relations with the administration that they would do nothing that might help make the principal look good in the public eye. One teacher described such a group of teachers:<p><blockquote>There's an element of the faculty that's anti-anything-the-administration-does. . . . Maybe it's true for all schools. I don't know. And they always have a negative way of asking questions [at faculty meetings]. Everything's framed in a negative way.</blockquote>	Because of concerns raised by the above three issues, many schools' restructuring efforts were forced to address non-classroom-based issues. The philosophical and political became so entwined at many schools that it was difficult to determine which concerns generated greater tension. Political maneuvering sometimes overrode concerns with school reform. This often dismayed those who were looking to put Coalition ideas into practice. As one teacher remarked:<p><blockquote>I don't think we ever sat down and really [asked ourselves], "What does it mean and what are the implications for my department and what are the implications for me as a teacher, or a counselor, or whatever I happen to be?" It was all in the political: "Did we do this or didn't we do that?" . . . [And] there were some issues with leadership here. . . . So to me it was more those issues than, really, that we don't believe in less-is-more.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tet"><h3>The Emotional Toll</h3>Some of the "problems" that emerged at Coalition schools might also be viewed as signs of success. For example, greater closeness with students and other faculty increased many teachers' sense of commitment to their work. For some, though, it also meant that they confronted issues and problems that they had previously ignored. In particular, this was the case for teachers who taught in urban high schools or who had substantial numbers of lower-track students. Many teachers had come to accept that, with both populations, it was common for a sizable percentage of students to leave a teacher's class through the course of the school year. <p>	One teacher who had left a college preparatory high school to work at a comprehensive urban school explained how a more personalized environment generated increased commitment to his students as well as personal anxiety:<p><blockquote>[Being in the Essential school] has helped me to reassess my teaching strategies. I know it's difficult to teach here [compared with my previous school]. It can be more rewarding but it's exhausting. . . . I really questioned my thinking about teaching and I have taken more risks. I like having the responsibility for my curriculum and the program overall. I think it allows me to better evaluate my students' progress because I get to see my students as individuals. It's also led me to work harder and made me more resourceful. </blockquote><blockquote>In an urban setting, with poverty and other problems, the kids you teach have problems with self-esteem, but you also have the fact of them having a lower socio-economic base, less clothing, more ties with peers, additional travel time to school, and so on. The problems build exponentially. And you're trying to reach kids from diverse settings who often have fewer language skills. That's why it's exhausting. Not only are you a teacher but you're a social worker; you may even offer medical advice to some. </blockquote><blockquote>To reach some kids, it's not enough to disseminate information. You need to get to know the students and that takes its own toll. That's why it's so exhausting. And it's very hard to leave the school and make the night yours -- you either have work to do or are thinking about students. And there are some students that I can't reach and I do think about that. But to preserve your sanity, you need to recognize that, because so many problems are so profound. You realize [school] represents a last chance for many students.</blockquote>	Another teacher, reflecting that his changing attitude toward student failure created new worries for him, explained: <p><blockquote>In the traditional setting, it was a lot easier for me to dump the responsibility for a lack of progress by a student onto the student. Now, it's nearly impossible for me. . . . Before, I could say that it was someone else's problem -- I tried and it didn't work. Now, I feel more responsible for a student's progress than before.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="iw"><h3>Increased Workload</h3>Teachers often reported that their Coalition involvement resulted in more work. The tasks they viewed as necessary (and as their responsibility) sometimes increased their workload to the point where it became a serious problem. <p>	For instance, they now sought to improve student attendance and to challenge students academically. If a Coalition program succeeded in getting more students to attend school regularly (as many of our study sites with previously poor attendance rates did), faculty had more students to teach. Once students began doing more of their school work, teachers had more work to review and assess. Once teachers began challenging their students with more active rather than rote learning, teachers had new units and projects to develop. Shifts from such traditional forms of assessment as multiple-choice exams to essay tests or research projects also entailed more work for teachers -- both designing the new projects and overseeing their execution. Finally, encouraging parents to be more involved in their child's school took time. In effect, the teachers' reward for working hard and for success in each case was more work. Many of the teachers in our study schools spoke candidly about these changes, as the following two quotes illustrate:<p><blockquote>What I've found that has really changed since I became involved [with my school's pilot Essential school team] is that I'm doing much more research for my class plans. I used to be able to go for three weeks without developing any lessons, at the minimum. If I was bummed or feeling lazy, I would just not do any class prep, and no one would know that. I'm not that way now. It's all new. And now I'm responsible to the rest of my team, and my classes only meet four days a week, so I can't blow one off. They're all important.</blockquote><blockquote>There are extreme demands on my time. . . . This has to change. Over vacation, I spent an entire day [here] -- and I have a student teacher. . . . I feel we need . . . clerical support. I thought that with the Essential school program I'd teach and develop curriculum, but I'm doing lots of clerical stuff. I'm also acting like a counselor for students and that is time-consuming and I can't say to a kid that I can't see him or her. Their concerns are important. Our contact with parents is good, too, but it's [all too] time-consuming.</blockquote>	One disconcerting discovery that teachers in our schools made is that their workload did not diminish in subsequent years. As one teacher remarked during her second year of Coalition involvement:<p><blockquote>It's still very demanding. If I'm doing things right it means that I'm spending even more time on my work. I go home now expecting to work and fall asleep. The kids are now doing work and I've got to be ready for them. I have to get their papers back to them but I have a hard time getting homework back the next day all the time. It's affecting me.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="disi"><h3>Disillusionment</h3>Some of the issues and problems elaborated upon thus far generated another problem: disillusionment on the part of pro-Coalition teachers. They often cited as reasons for this disillusionment the increased workloads and -- in their eyes -- disappointing student reactions to their efforts. Other teachers became disillusioned with aspects of the Coalition's philosophy, either as implemented at their school or because they perceived that the problems they encountered revealed the limits of its applicability or problems inherent in the ideas.<p>	Some pro-Coalition teachers became disillusioned with their colleagues regarding their commitment to Coalition philosophy as well as to their students. As one teacher explained:<p><blockquote>Sometimes I get discouraged because I feel that [Coalition] philosophy is not the core of people's beliefs. It's being broken down. There are lots of people in our program and there are lots of agendas. Sometimes it discourages me. Of course, we're all humans, so we're going to be different; but, to be a good educator, I think you really need to like the kids . . . and not blame them for where they are. You have to respect them to even know what they need. . . .  Some teachers believe this job owes them something. . . . When I joined the program, I thought that those who were in the program agreed to go along with the philosophy of the Essential school program. But that has not turned out to be the case.</blockquote>	A general difficulty teachers described was that their colleagues did not fully understand Coalition philosophy. One teacher remarked: "I must admit that I'm having some problems with the rest of my team. I'm not sure that they're all 'getting it.'" <p>	Sometimes collaboration was difficult because individual team members were unwilling participants; other times it was more because members did not get along. A final quote illustrates the disillusionment that occurred when teamed teachers had different expectations about what collaboration entailed:<p><blockquote>I came in with a lot of hopes and expectations for what I could do with a social studies person. I viewed whoever was in that position as my natural, closest colleague on the team, an ally in curriculum and method. And that has always been a source of tremendous frustration for me. . . . There were just pieces of her turf that she was never willing to give up. For instance, I never saw her [course] materials. She'd say, "We're doing the Reformation." But that's not really very informative. If you really want to make links, you have to know what's being said about the Reformation . . . specifically. And I had a lot of trouble getting that kind of information.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="back"><h3>Backsliding</h3>While some disillusionment was typical among teachers, others remained committed to Coalition ideas and their own efforts but found themselves reverting to previous practice. For instance, when teachers encountered student resistance to their efforts or when they felt overwhelmed by the work and the responsibilities associated with their program, a common response was to fall back on traditional habits. For many teachers, "new and different" came to mean "uncertain, potentially disruptive, and probably more work." <p>	To avoid the problems that arose from trying to change traditional aspects of teaching, some resorted to time-tested practices that had kept life more manageable9 -- for example, by assigning less work and maintaining quieter (more orderly) classrooms. <p>	At one Coalition school, a math teacher devised a curriculum that was less dependent on a standard text. As he recounted it, student resistance contributed to his "falling back into his old habits":<p><blockquote>There was a lot of student resistance. The big problem was that I'd fall back into my old habits if things didn't work well. I found that very frustrating. Also, without a book, students were very insecure. They were always trying to get me to tell them how to do this rather than discovering the processes for themselves. They just wanted to find out the answer rather than to understand the essence of things. For instance, when we worked on statistics, students wanted a book. They were very insecure. They kept saying, "I'm supposed to be in algebra class; where's my algebra book?" They wanted to cover traditional topics. They were so insecure without the book -- not that they even knew how to use it.</blockquote>	Eventually, this teacher adopted a standard text. The example is instructive because it shows both the teacher's and the students' frustration when new approaches seem too different -- in terms of students' past experiences as well as classroom organization and pedagogy. Many of the teachers in this study described similar reactions to pedagogical, structural, or content-based experiments. <p>	Teachers sometimes viewed backsliding as a temporary adjustment to allow for a regrouping that would lead to renewed efforts. At times, though, it was to prove the beginning of a slow but steady return to previous practices by teachers who felt overwhelmed by and undersupported in their reform efforts. These examples also make more intelligible the often-heard requests for structure, models, or evidence about what was proving successful within the Coalition's philosophical orientation. <p>	The following quote reflects an awareness of the Coalition's emphasis on local interpretation of the Common Principles, but a deep desire for "something to grab on to" to help anchor reform and push it forward.<p><blockquote>I get the impression, at least in the beginning, the Coalition [said], "Well everybody, you just go do it and you'll find out for yourself how it works and so forth." That's all well and good, but I think most people need something to grab on to, some kind of structure. It doesn't have to be something that doesn't have any flexibility; [it should be] something that says, "This is our experience in terms of what other people have done that's been successful. It doesn't mean you have to do this, but this is a proven quantity."</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="rotf"><hr><center><h2>Reflections on the Findings</h2></center><hr>Analysis of teacher comments from eight of the original Coalition member schools collected between 1986 and 1990 through interviews, observations, and the examination of written documents has revealed several similar perceptions about the pros and cons of Coalition membership. To summarize, the seven principal reasons teachers advocated membership in the Coalition were:<p><ul><li>the personal and professional transformations they attributed to their Coalition-related efforts;<p><li>the benefits they perceived for their students and themselves from increased personalization of teaching and learning;<p><li>the grassroots nature of teacher involvement in the reform process;<p><li>the classroom-based successes they felt emerged from new scheduling arrangements;<p><li>the "personalized" professional development activities -- often self-initiated -- that they felt better reflected their needs and interests;<p><li>the support that came from affiliating with an expanding network of schools experimenting with similar ideas; and<p><li>the increased reflectiveness of faculty and administrators that supporters (and dissenters) attributed to open and frequent discussions about the school's philosophy/ vision.</ul><p>	These reasons for supporting Coalition membership are focused, for the most part, on positive consequences for students and teachers and on what goes on in the classroom. This is an important point, for the classroom relationship among student, teacher, and material was the original focus of Coalition reform efforts and, in fact, the intent of the Common Principles was to refocus attention on this relationship.<p>	The reasons teachers opposed the Coalition may be summarized as follows:<p><ul><li>questions about the need for each particular school and individual to change;<p><li>philosophical and practical difficulties with specific Common Principles, such as universal goals and teacher-as-generalist;<p><li>incomplete socialization of teachers to Coalition programs, which resulted in inconsistencies and resentment;<p><li>threats perceived by teachers to elective courses and jobs that would accompany an intellectual focus and a rethinking of the notion of a comprehensive high school;<p><li>political concerns such as equity, ownership of the change process and the school, and the administration's role in the reform initiative;<p><li>the emotional drain that teachers experienced as they personalized their classrooms and dealt with opposition to their work;<p><li>the cumulative effects of the increased workload on teachers who were implementing reform; and<p><li>the disillusionment teachers felt when students did not respond to their efforts and/or when teaming with other teachers proved problematic.</ul><p>	By itself, this list is less clear than the reasons for supporting the Coalition, in large part because these reasons came from two distinct categories of people: those who were opposed to the Coalition from the start, and those whose opposition developed after Coalition-related reforms were undertaken. It might be useful to look at these two types of opposition separately.<p><h4>Teachers Opposed from the Start</h4>Four of the eight reasons for opposition to Coalition membership applied more often to these teachers -- they questioned the need for change, expressed strong disagreement with aspects of the Coalition's philosophy, felt that implementing Coalition ideas would result in job loss, and often voiced political reasons for their opposition. Frankly, <i>few of these teachers were ever convinced to change their minds, and at four schools they have been effective at stalling comprehensive attempts to implement Coalition ideas. </i><p>	Only where these teachers have been dismissed or reassigned elsewhere in the system have pro-Coalition teachers been able to effect more comprehensive, schoolwide reform. And where these actions have been taken, some teachers have voiced an allegiance to Coalition ideas that they may not completely hold in order to retain their positions. <p>	Further,<i> most of the teachers at our study schools who were initially indifferent or uncommitted to the reform efforts quickly joined these teachers in outright opposition to the Coalition when they began to experience the consequences of change efforts undertaken at their school</i>. By adding to the numbers of opposed teachers, they have added to the effectiveness of efforts to stall or terminate Coalition reforms at the schools.<p><h4>Teacher Opposition That Developed during Implementation</h4>The final three reasons for opposition (that it was emotionally draining, that the workload became intolerable, and that teachers became disillusioned with what they viewed as their partial success) -- combined with another reason (incomplete socialization to Coalition ideas) -- often resulted in the backsliding behavior that tended to accompany an emerging opposition to the Coalition. While the opposition that emerged in this way had real (and often negative) consequences for individual teachers and for the school as a whole, it usually was not based on a disagreement with Coalition ideas. Rather it was the result of the perceived impossibility of achieving the reform's ends. <i>This disillusionment was sometimes caused by the often escalating resistance to new ideas that teachers confronted in their classrooms and among their colleagues, but just as often could be viewed as the result of initial "successes" of reform efforts at the school. </i><p>	As programs or experiments began to take hold, two consequences emerged: opposed teachers strengthened their criticism, and supportive teachers' workloads continued to increase. When manifestations of success were dismissed as a result of preferential treatment or special conditions, exasperated and overworked teachers felt even more attacked and vulnerable. Rather than diminishing over time, tensions often gained strength from the opposition's ability to use specific examples from the school to challenge the Coalition's ideas, rather than the more abstract or hypothetical examples that had accompanied preimplementation debate. This proved especially trying because criticisms voiced by opponents were then taken personally by pro-Coalition teachers. Communication between pro- and anti-Coalition teachers continued to worsen. <p>	In concert with feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work and the extra time that teachers were committing to make reforms happen, these renewed criticisms were sometimes the straws that broke the camel's back. Some teachers began to "backslide" -- return to aspects of their previous classroom and schoolwide practices -- in an attempt to reduce the pressure they felt and/or to regain some semblance of control over their lives. Others maintained their current activities, but made it clear that they would not take on additional responsibilities and that they could not much longer sustain the pace that had been set to date. <p>	Teachers talking about why they like or dislike Coalition principles and initiatives at their schools reveals much about the Coalition-inspired reforms and perhaps something about the change process more generally. The classroom-based experimentation that teachers perceived as successful inspired confidence in the reform ideas and a sense of empowerment among involved teachers. Classroom-based change could be a powerful positive outcome of a school's participation in the Coalition, regardless of the outcome of schoolwide efforts at change. Opposition could be a powerful block to schoolwide change from the start, but also could emerge as a result of the initial efforts (particularly if they were deemed successful according to members of the school community's definitions of success). Both forms of opposition could and did impede further reform efforts. <p>	Sarason (1990) has argued that for school reforms to be effective they must serve the interests and needs of teachers as well as students. Effective reforms, he said, will make schools more humane places within which to teach and learn. Both Sizer and Sarason, along with many other educational researchers, have stressed the fundamental interconnections of all aspects of school life. Further, Sizer (1989) has emphasized the fundamental interconnection of the Coalition's Common Principles. <p>	We suggest that the second form of opposition -- opposition that emerges as a result of limited successes and the stresses that are associated with trying to implement reforms -- results from the beginnings of a challenge that reform efforts are making to this fundamental interconnection of all aspects of school life. The dual challenge for those interested in sustaining and deepening school change efforts is: 1) to overcome the backlashtendencies that emerge in schools when some experimentation proves successful enough to heighten opposition to change; and 2) to support teachers who start to backslide in response to increased workloads, tensions, and the disillusionment that may result from limited success and heightened controversy from the backlash. Otherwise, the reform process itself risks turning schools into even <i>less </i>humane places in which to work than the pre-reform schools had been.<p>	Further, in assessing school reform efforts such as the Coalition, it is essential to bear in mind something that Seymour Sarason (1992) claims was perhaps the most important lesson of previous reform efforts. "If anything has been learned from past efforts to reform schools," he says, "it is this: At best you will only be partially successful." <p>	The trick, teacher' remarks suggests to us, is to make it more likely that the partial success of a well-intentioned school reform effort will not be completely swamped by the increased contentious-ness that is likely to accompany it or by the personal costs that have been accumulated in attaining it.<p><hr><center><h2>Notes and References</h2></center><hr><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><h3>Notes </h3><p><ol><p><li> A Study of High Schools generated three books: <i>Horace's Compromise </i>(1984) by Sizer; <i>The Shopping Mall High School </i>(1985) by Arthur Powell, Eleanor Farrar, and David Cohen; and <i>The Last Little Citadel </i>(1986) by Robert Hampel.<p><li> The city school system consists of seventeen high schools. There are five "academic" high schools and three vocational/technical schools, all designated as magnet schools to which students must apply and meet entrance requirements in order to enroll. The nine remaining schools are neighborhood comprehensive high schools. The top students in the city generally attend the academic or vocational/technical schools, with the remaining students entering the comprehensive high schools. <p><li> As agreed upon by the faculty, abstentions were counted in the second category, as neither opposed nor willing to participate actively. <p><li> The power of these personal testimonials was recognized by those within member schools and by the Coalition staff, who often asked the most articulate supporters to speak about their personal changes and their effects in the classroom at conferences and workshops. <p><li> In discussing the literature on professional development activities, Smith and O'Day (1990) observed that professional development budgets are often limited and highly susceptible to budget cuts. (See also Guskey 1986, Little et al. 1987, and McLaughlin 1990.) Teachers who select their own professional development activities report it to be a more positive experience, and a study by Purkey and Smith (1983) suggests a positive effect on student achievement. Barth (1990) discusses the importance of schools' using professional development to build consensus about change and to work to improve their schools.

As members of the Coalition, these schools have been working to implement change since at least 1985. <p>	Second, as these schools' restructuring agendas have evolved, they have incorporated many aspects of reform common to several current change efforts -- for instance, restructuring their schools into teams of students and teachers, reorganizing their school days into extended time blocks, promoting school-site management, initiating their own professional development activities, experimenting with alternative assessment methods, and promoting pedagogies to make students active learners. <p>	Finally, and again mirroring developments in the larger educational arena, these schools' reform efforts have encountered problems and resistance (Firestone et al. 1989; Fiske 1991; Futrell 1989; Muncey and McQuillan 1993; McQuillan and Muncey n.d.). <p>	Through these case studies, we will examine multiple dimensions of the Coalition of Essential Schools' reform effort. We begin by providing a brief overview of the Coalition's philosophy, formation, and growth. We next discuss our research project, the School Ethnography Project. Then we turn to our three case study schools, each of which adopted a different approach to Coalition reform: a school-within-a-school (SWAS) program that has continued to expand and include more and more of the school; a whole-school effort that approached reform in multiple ways and made both change and professional development the focus of many of its daily activities; and a new school created and designed to honor and embody Coalition ideas. <p>	Because the Coalition offers no model for school change nor even one required starting point for change, looking at three different approaches to school change offers a rich understanding of the processes of school reform experienced by this restructuring movement. <p>	We focused on these three schools because, although these schools were not problem-free,1 of our eight study sites, these were selected by the Coalition as those showing the most concerted and sustained efforts to experiment with reform ideas. In addition, the Coalition of Essential Schools has identified these as "second-step" schools, schools that are deepening reform schoolwide and that might reasonably be expected to be "more fully articulated Coalition schools" within the next few years. <p>	In the final section of this chapter, we draw shared characteristics from these three case studies that seemed to foster, sustain, and deepen efforts to change schools, discussing also some of the implications of these shared characteristics for school reform. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcoe"><h3>The Coalition of Essential Schools </h3>The Coalition of Essential Schools was founded in 1984 by Theodore Sizer, former Dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and former Headmaster at Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts. Coalition philosophy is the product of thinking, research, and writing that emerged from a five-year, multisite study of American secondary schools, A Study of High Schools.2 <p>	Drawing on his experiences in schools and the general shortcomings he perceived in American education, Sizer wrote a narrative about his findings, <i>Horace's Compromise</i>, and devised a philosophy, codified in the Common Principles (see Appendix A), that has formed the basis of the Coalition. Prior to and at the time of his book's publication, Sizer and his associates promoted his philosophy in many contexts. Based on what he perceived as an enthusiastic reception for his ideas among the teachers and school administrators he met, Sizer recruited schools willing to experiment with his ideas, and he put together a small, university-based staff to assist this effort. <p>	From its inception the Coalition has envisioned itself as a partnership in which a university-based Central Staff (and increasingly a regional Coalition staff) and school personnel benefit from their mutual areas of expertise. As a self-defined grassroots reform movement focused on helping students to "use their minds well" and on improving classroom teaching and learning, the Coalition differs from many reform efforts in that it rejects centralized and standardized solutions to school problems. <p>	While the Coalition of Essential Schools is founded on the nine Common Principles, how these principles are implemented in the daily business of school life is determined by the needs and understandings of individual schools. The Central and Regional Staff assist restructuring schools through professional development activities and through the development, refinement, and dissemination of information about school-based projects aimed at improving schooling and creating more thoughtful practitioners and students. From an initial membership of twelve charter schools in December of 1985 and a Central Staff of three persons, the Coalition has grown to include over 400 schools and a Central Staff that now numbers nearly forty persons. <p>	In part, this expansion resulted from a partnership called Re:Learning that the Coalition initiated with the Education Commission of the States (ECS), a "non-profit, nationwide interstate compact formed to help governors, state legislators, state education officials and others develop policies to improve education" (Re:Learning 1989). While the Coalition focuses on school-site reform, ECS works with state and local governmental agencies to create a policy environment conducive to school-site change. Most of the newest Coalition member schools have joined through states that are part of the Re:Learning partnership. All of the study schools described in this paper were charter-member schools, and none are located in a Re:Learning state.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tsep"><h3>The School Ethnography Project </h3>The School Ethnography Project began a five-year ethnographic study of the Coalition's Central Staff, eight charter member schools, and the professional development activities offered by the Central Staff for member (and potential member) schools in the summer of 1986, when the first member schools were still in the initial stages of their restructuring efforts. <p>	While we feel that our research offers a valuable perspective on school change and has implications for future restructuring efforts, our work was not a formal educational evaluation of the Coalition of Essential Schools. Rather, we sought to document broadly what occurred as a consequence of the Coalition's reform efforts by focusing on two general questions about the Common Principles: How are the Principles interpreted by individ-ual schools? And, how do teachers, administrators, and students in Coalition schools develop and implement the principles in each setting?<p>	In our research we sought to include an array of perspectives -- including those of supporters and opponents of Coalition philosophy and practices, Central Staff members and school personnel, and students, teachers, and administrators. Specifically, we spent substantial amounts of time in each of our eight study sites observing classes, after-school activities, planning meetings, and so forth. We also interviewed students, teachers, and administrators about school life as well as any proposed or implemented changes and their future plans. In addition, we read the Coalition Central Staff's archival collection on each of our study schools, which included reports of work done with or by the school prior to the start of our research. We concluded our research in June 1990. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs1"><hr><center><h2>Case Study I:Lewis High School </h2></center><hr><p>Located in a mid-Atlantic city of 750,000 residents, Lewis High is a "zoned" or neighborhood, comprehensive school that enrolls an entirely African-American student population of about 1,100. About three-quarters of the faculty are also African-American. The city school system consists of seventeen high schools. There are five "academic" high schools and three vocational/technical schools, all designated as magnet schools for which students must apply and meet entrance requirements in order to enroll. The nine remaining schools are neighborhood comprehensive high schools. The top students in the city generally attend the academic or vocational/technical schools; the remaining students enter the comprehensive high schools. As one foundation report observed, "Of all the high schools, the lowest attendance, worst scores, and the highest dropout rates are found in the comprehensive high schools."3 <p>	In some ways Lewis fits the typical conception of an urban high school. Many school doors are locked or chained closed to restrict the flow of outsiders into the school. Students take public transportation to school and are greeted in the morning by teachers and administrators who check their ID's and make certain that they have "regulation" book bags -- they must be mesh so that students cannot conceal weapons. Lewis's dress code restricts students from wearing baseball caps, leather jackets, or gold jewelry -- in part, to avoid having valuable items stolen and in part, to distinguish Lewis students from outsiders who wander into the building. Security guards and administrators carry walkie-talkies. Classes are generally large; most enroll over thirty students. <p>	Yet, Lewis has a comfortable, "small school" feel as well. In the classrooms and hallways students, teachers, and administrators seem at ease with one another. The school offers an array of extracur-ricular activities, and participating students and faculty appear enthusiastic about them. Most members of the Lewis "family," a common description of the school by those associated with it, freely acknowledge pride in their school. Reflecting something of this pride, the school is clean and relatively litter-free. <p>	Although Lewis relocated for building renovations from the fall of 1988 through the spring of 1991, in its permanent location the school is unquestionably a "neighborhood school," with many families choosing to send more than one child to the school.<p>	When Lewis began its Coalition involvement in 1985, the school enrolled nearly 2,000 students. While being renovated, Lewis shared a building with another high school. At this time, enrollment decreased by approximately 900 students, precipitating a concern with job security by some faculty.<p>	In terms of our research sample, Lewis High is an interesting case: while there were four school-within-a-school (SWAS) reform efforts in our sample of study schools, Lewis was the only one that expanded its SWAS program throughout the five years of our research -- adding more students as well as faculty members to the program every year. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fltt"><h3>Factors Leading to the Expansion of the SWAS </h3>A variety of interrelated factors appear to have allowed Lewis to experience this continued growth -- one being the program's structure. <p><h4>Flexible Scheduling</h4>One of the first objectives of the SWAS was to create a flexible schedule that would allow SWAS faculty to adjust time segments to meet their educational needs. To do this, the team created two extended time blocks for SWAS classes -- one double-period in the morning and one triple-period block in the afternoon. These time slots were then subdivided to match ongoing educational priorities. For instance, since the teachers decided to focus their efforts on getting 75 percent of all SWAS students to pass the required state competency exams in reading, writing, math, and citizenship in their sophomore years, they scheduled students to meet and prepare intensively in the appropriate discipline the weeks prior to each exam.<p><h4>Personalization</h4>A second key aspect of Lewis's SWAS program was the personalization SWAS teachers tried to create for their students. As one SWAS member explained: "We're closer to our students simply because we have fewer. Also, we know more about individual students because we can have more parental contact and individualized instruction. We know what students really can do." <p>	At a Coalition-sponsored symposium a SWAS student concurred with his teacher's perspective:<p><blockquote>I hadn't experienced education that was this personalized before. In the larger school, classes were so large that teachers could only lecture. In the Essential School we're able to develop a real relationship with our teachers. We're almost like a family. . . . [And] teachers not only teach us "facts." . . . We learn to be leaders, we learn to work in groups, and I, personally, have come to realize that learning is a constant process, not something that just takes place in classrooms. </blockquote>	This more personalized school environment has taken many forms at Lewis. Besides having a lower student/teacher ratio than the larger school, the SWAS has sponsored activities intended to address more than traditional, classroom academic concerns: inviting speakers to talk with students about being young, African-American, and growing up in an urban environment; making field trips to college campuses to give students a glimpse of college life; and arranging to have all SWAS students take PSAT exams. The manner in which the SWAS used the Coalition idea of exhibitions represented an effort to incorporate a more personalized dimension into the curriculum. Either at the end of a course or prior to graduation, exhibitions -- which are selected by individual students based on their particular interests and strengths -- serve as multidisciplinary, culminating activities where students <i>exhibit </i>the abilities developed through their studies before faculty and community members. <p><h4>Multiple Support Mechanisms</h4>Another factor that appears to have played a pivotal role in the program's continued expansion was the multiple support mechanisms that existed for the program, perhaps the most prominent being program leadership. Although the city superintendent who sought Coalition membership resigned two years into Lewis's Coalition affiliation and her replacement had an uncertain commitment to Coalition philosophy, administrative support for Lewis's SWAS at the school site remained consistent. Throughout the program's existence, Lewis's principal, David Johnson, has been a vocal propo-nent of this effort, within the city as well as nationally. As principal, he provided the program with forceful administrative support -- recruiting teachers, securing foundation grants, assigning uninterested teachers elsewhere, and reallocating staff positions to support the SWAS. The program coordinator for Lewis's Essential School -- a full-time administrative position4 -- has also been in that position since the school joined the Coalition. She, too, has overseen the program's implementation and development, has assisted SWAS fundraising efforts, and has participated in professional development efforts within Lewis and nationally as a representative of a Coalition school.<p>	Lewis's SWAS efforts have also been supported by foundation grants. These supplemental funds have allowed SWAS faculty to attend professional development activities (often Coalition-sponsored), to sponsor their own professional development activities, and to purchase equipment for the SWAS. They have also offset the cost of field trips taken by SWAS faculty and students.<p>	In addition to school-site and foundation support, the Coalition of Essential Schools' Central Staff have been very involved with Lewis High. As a charter member of the Coalition, David Johnson and the program coordinator attended semiannual or annual meetings of the Principals' and Coordinators' Council to discuss program developments and consider ways to further their reform efforts. Since Lewis consistently expanded the size of its Essential School and continued to restructure its program -- for example, by making schoolwide exhibitions a prerequisite for graduation from their program -- the Central Staff selected Lewis High for the Five Schools Project and focused a portion of its expertise and funding on helping these second-step schools promote change. The Central Staff also selected Lewis for the IBM Project which offered participating schools an opportunity to utilize computer databases and networking to promote school-site reform. <p>	As well as schoolwide involvement with these Coalition projects, individual Lewis faculty and administrators have participated in other Coali-tion-related efforts. David Johnson, for example, has been a Thomson Fellow. In this role, the city school department releases him from time to time to attend conferences, symposia, and workshops and discuss aspects of Lewis's Coalition program. Two Lewis teachers serve as Citibank Faculty members, receiving training in how to promote school-site change and serving as consultants to restructuring schools. Furthermore, Lewis faculty and administrators are often asked by Central Staff to make presentations at Coalition-sponsored work-shops and symposia. <p><h4>Early Success Leading to Growth</h4>Early evidence of success in the Lewis SWAS has also contributed to the program's growth and visibility. One indicator of success cited by Lewis's SWAS has been their students' performance on the state-mandated competency exams. Between 1986 and 1989, SWAS students did better than their "large school" counterparts in all four subject areas, and they did better than the system-wide average in all but one exam, where they equaled the systemwide score.5 Moreover, in terms of atten-dance, dropout rates, and college acceptances, the SWAS has had an impressive record. During the 1988-89 school year the SWAS program had an attendance rate of 92 percent, whereas in the larger school the rate was 74 percent, and citywide it was slightly more than 80 percent. And, during the 1988-89 school year, the SWAS dropout rate was less than 2 percent;6 for non-SWAS students it was 23 percent, and for the city it was over 11 percent. Lewis's SWAS has also been relatively successful in terms of college acceptances -- in its first graduating class (in 1988-89), three-quarters of its graduates went on to two- or four-year colleges or vocational education compared with 42 percent for non-SWAS students and 11 percent for the city overall. <p>	It may also have been important that these signs of success were widely touted. Lewis's SWAS has been the focus of articles in local papers and national publications. As a Thomson Fellow, David Johnson has traveled widely to discuss his program. In recognition of Lewis's efforts, the Coalition Central Staff have featured the school in workshops as well as public presentations. This positive exposure has helped to reassure parents and persuade them to enroll their children in the SWAS. Students, too, have been impressed by these figures and have joined the SWAS without parental urging. Lewis's administration has also used these figures to convince the superintendent's office of the program's effectiveness and need for continued support. These measures of success have also proved persuasive in reports to funders. <p><h4>Professional Development Activities</h4>Another factor that seems to have helped sustain the growth of the program was that Lewis's SWAS sponsored its own professional development activities -- ranging from week-long summer institutes to half-day workshops -- designed to develop aspects of their program and introduce new faculty to Coalition philosophy. Often, Coalition Central Staff members participated in these workshops. Commenting on the first summer institute, the program coordinator discussed some workshop activities:<p><blockquote>We looked at different teaching styles. We looked at different curricula. We looked at coaching. We looked at how we would implement student-as-worker. We did critical thinking skills. We did interdisciplinary curri-cula. And each morning we would have a work session. Then that evening, we would try to implement . . . what we said we were going to do that morning. We would coach each other. We did curriculum development and we did practical applications of what it was we were doing. In the final weeks we had a laboratory school . . . [where] we used the integrated curriculum approach. We combined math and science, and we did humanities in which we included foreign language, English, and social studies. </blockquote><h4>Few Constraints for Change</h4>At Lewis, there were few existing school structures that may have restricted SWAS expansion.7 Although Lewis High offers Communication Arts and Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps programs, there were no serious conflicts between these programs and the SWAS. One program, the Business Department, did express reservations with SWAS expansion. Their main concern stemmed from the SWAS's curriculum, which -- because of its increased requirements in math, social studies, foreign language, and science -- restricted the number of electives Lewis SWAS students could take. Consequently, with the advent of the SWAS program, their department's size steadily decreased -- from eleven to four faculty members. Nonetheless, these teachers never mobilized significant resistance to the program's expansion. <p>	Furthermore, although grievances related to SWAS expansion were filed by the teachers' union, these actions did not deter program expansion. When Lewis faculty "grieved" their assignments to other city schools on the basis of building seniority, the transfers stood since the Coalition SWAS had "special program" status which allowed relatively inexperienced SWAS faculty to maintain their building tenure over teachers with departmental seniority. <p><h4>Hiring Flexibility</h4>A final factor that promoted the continued expansion of Lewis's SWAS was the hiring flexibility created by the reassignment of over thirty Lewis teachers due to decreased enrollment, a consequence of moving to a new building, combined with citywide demographic shifts. When this occurred and reassignment became apparent, the SWAS held "interest meetings" to determine which faculty wanted to join the program. As Johnson commented in anticipation of that shift:<p><blockquote>Some teachers probably won't buy Coalition philosophy. But I can help them relocate. I couldn't do that before, but I can now [because of having fewer students]. So those staying here will use Essential School ideas -- such as lecturing less, more group work. I hope it will be voluntary.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cots"><h3>Criticisms of the SWAS</h3>Although Lewis's SWAS expanded consistently, the program did encounter skepticism and resistance from some uninvolved faculty. One common criticism was that SWAS students received preferential treatment. Uninvolved faculty maintained that SWAS students were provided privileges and opportunities unavailable to other Lewis students -- such as taking overnight field trips (some non-SWAS faculty inaccurately thought overnight trips were banned), having more opportunities to study a foreign language (most foreign language teachers were SWAS faculty), and being able to make-up incomplete work over holidays and the summer (rather than failing or attending summer school). <p>	Additionally, some noninvolved faculty felt that SWAS teachers received preferential treatment. As was common with noninvolved teachers' reactions to other SWAS programs, these teachers cited the SWAS teachers' reduced student load and additional planning time as signs of this preferred treatment. They also cited the number of professional development activities SWAS faculty attended because of their grants and what they saw as the disproportionate dispersal of school funds for the SWAS. <p>	Intra-faculty tensions also emerged from concerns with job security. As discussed earlier, some Lewis faculty were upset by how decisions to transfer faculty to other city schools were made. Also, some uninvolved faculty argued that Coalition philosophy was not appropriate for all Lewis students -- specifically because of its college-oriented curriculum. In the words of one non-SWAS teacher:<p><blockquote>My concern is that every child in Lewis High School is not going to college. We know this. And yet the program is set up [as] strictly academic, with little or no room for electives. [The neighborhoods] where our students come from, most of these students go to work. They're looking for immediate employment. We would like to see them do something other than fast food, which is fine to a point, but, once they graduate, it hurts to see them slinging hamburgers when they could be operating a computer. But they must be proficient in those areas. They must have marketable skills.</blockquote>	While Lewis's SWAS was the only one of four SWAS programs in our study sample that consistently expanded and simultaneously appeared to deepen its efforts to restructure the school and implement CES reform, we are not asserting that Lewis has solved the problems of urban education. In fact, other researchers have questioned the extent to which SWAS teachers have deepened their understandings of Coalition philosophy and the quality of their students' work. 	Nevertheless, the Lewis program has continued to expand, and it has struggled with exhibitions and other manifestations of a deepening of Coalition ideas, an impressive feat given that it encountered many of the same problems that beset the other SWAS programs. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs2"><hr><center><h2>Case Study II:Green Valley Junior/Senior High School</h2></center><hr><p>Green Valley Junior/Senior High School is located in the northeastern quadrant of the country. The town of Green Valley has the second lowest per-capita income in an Appalachian state that provides little support for local education. According to 1980 census figures, much of the town lives below the poverty level and many families receive welfare assistance. The school is small, with roughly 350 students enrolled in grades seven through twelve and a staff of slightly more than thirty. While the physical plant is sparse, there is a sense of community, life, and excitement about the school. A Green Valley teacher described this sense of community when reflecting on her first year of teaching:<p><blockquote>I was taught [in college] that the first year of teaching is hell because you're so alone. But that's not true here. In [college], doing my student teaching, I only had one mentor. Here, I have thirty-three. . . . The atmosphere is honest and open. There's lots of help available. I can go to anyone and count on them.</blockquote><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="kaot"><h3>Key Aspects of the Reform Efforts</h3>Much of what occurs at Green Valley Junior/Senior High emanates from its principal, Stuart Tucker. He came to the school in 1981 after leaving a similar position at a relatively prominent middle school. The school that Stuart Tucker took over in 1981 had a troubled recent history. While many local residents had memories of a positive and successful past, in the late seventies the school faced many problems. School funding -- on both the state and local level -- was very tight. Teacher salaries were low, with the salary scale for first-year teachers just slightly over $10,000 and the top end for veteran teachers under $20,000. Furthermore, the school had one of the higher dropout rates in the state -- 20 percent -- and sent only 8 percent of its graduates to college. The absentee rate was nearly 20 percent. The school building was plagued by vandalism and neglect. <p><h4>An Innovative Structure</h4>When Stuart Tucker began working at Green Valley, the school had a very traditional structure -- a seven-period day, a faculty divided into discrete departments, and students who were each scheduled individually. Over time, Tucker and the faculty redesigned the school's structure. First, one period from the school day was eliminated and periods were lengthened. Study halls were eliminated. Teachers willing to team were recruited, and these experimental teams were assigned a set group of students and encouraged to schedule their classes as they considered appropriate for their course goals and students. This schedule allowed teamed teachers the flexibility to have their classes conduct an archaeological excavation of a colonial settlement, map out a "depth chart" of a local lake, and test the water in a local river and run-off brooks and streams for various pollutants. <p>	To promote active learning and teamed teaching among the faculty, Green Valley instituted their "two-week thing." Once a year, during the two-week thing, the school breaks from business-as-usual and organizes itself into interdisciplinary teams of teachers and students. Each year, the school selects a different theme, and teachers develop plans to address that theme. One year the home economics teacher secured an $8,000 grant to underwrite the school's effort to examine the question of "sustainability" -- how can the world be organized so that it doesn't slowly self-destruct? Beyond allowing students to address a topic in depth and from various disciplinary perspectives, during this two-week experience, everyday teaching was a potential source of professional development as teachers experienced team teach-ing, interdisciplinary courses, group learning, and a more flexible schedule. <p><h4>Personalization</h4>Another key aspect of Green Valley's reform efforts involved personalizing students' educational experience. For instance, to provide each student with an adult advocate on the faculty, the school instituted an advisory system. All staff, including the principal, are assigned approximately fifteen advisees with whom they meet every day during what most schools call homeroom. During this time, teachers can discuss students' academic work, problems students may be experiencing, issues that arise at the school, and so on. Commenting on the program, Stuart Tucker wrote in a paper presented at an educational conference: <p><blockquote>The structure is . . . there for the student to talk seriously and openly to an adult. The structure doesn't make any demands on the student to develop a deep interpersonal relationship with an advisor, it simply gives the student assurance that there is an adult who will listen. The point is that without the structure that put this in place, communication is limited and therefore, so is understanding and trust. In a crisis, two people cannot suddenly develop trust. It must be built beforehand. The advisory system makes that possible. </blockquote>	Another way in which Green Valley has attempted to personalize students' educational experiences is through the "Life After Green Valley" class. A required course for all seniors, these single-sex classes expose students to concerns involved with such practical life choices as interviewing for and finding a job, managing a budget. Students also have the opportunity to discuss health and social issues. In one class, for example, a teacher discussed AIDS, herpes, and various myths about birth control, showed the class of boys how to wear condoms properly, and stressed the implications of having unprotected sex ("We have a name for people who have sex without contraception -- we call them parents"). <p><h4>Apprenticeship Program</h4>Another Green Valley innovation directed at making school relevant for students is the Apprenticeship Program. For part of each day this program sends about fifty students to work in the community. Before being assigned a work site, students meet with the program director to determine what jobs interest them. They must then produce a resume and initiate the interview process. The program is intended to engage students in actively learning about relevant professional skills as well as offering them an opportunity to develop socially and intellectually outside the school setting. As part of this program, students have worked as newspaper reporters, as teacher aides in a local grammar school, as auto mechanics, and as secretaries for town businesses. <p><h4>Streamlined Discipline Policy</h4>Along with these structural and curricular changes, Tucker streamlined the school's discipline policy by implementing a series of simple rules: students are suspended for fighting, using drugs or alcohol, swearing at teachers, stealing, and destroying property. Reflecting on this policy at one Coalition-sponsored symposium, Tucker remarked: "We wanted to teach students to respect other students, to respect the faculty, to respect property, and to respect themselves and their own well-being."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fltt2"><h3>Factors Leading to the Expansion of Reform</h3>A variety of interrelated factors appear to have contributed to the sustained expansion and refinement of Green Valley's restructuring efforts.<p><h4>Leadership</h4>As was true at Lewis High, leadership seems to have played an integral role. Unlike most Coalition programs that we studied, Green Valley has no program coordinator -- either part- or full-time. Prior to Green Valley's membership, Tucker had been the impetus for most change and he continued in that role after the school joined the Coalition. As one faculty member explained:<p><blockquote>Stuart is concerned about all the faculty, both professionally and personally. I always thought of the principal as a figurehead. I never even met the principal at the school where I did my student teaching. But I see Stuart every day. He's very much a part of my day. He's involved with everything at the school, and that's important to the teachers and the kids.</blockquote>	Much of Tucker's enthusiasm has carried over to his staff, some of whom were at first skeptical. For instance, one Green Valley veteran was put off by Tucker's touting of the success the school experienced after his arrival because of the implicit criticism of previous efforts. Later, she came to support his efforts. Commenting on this shift she said: <p><blockquote>Stuart is a great persuader. . . . He can convince you to do anything. He told me that the program <i>needed </i>me. . . . He's the reason behind much of my professional change because he's been encouraging me to do more. </blockquote>	While Tucker's leadership and vision are widely regarded as key to the changes the school has experienced, Tucker's efforts have been complemented by grassroots support and commitment from his faculty that have allowed these changes to take root. The teams of teachers, for instance, have had virtually total freedom to develop curricula, design schedules, and organize student groups.<p><h4>Professional Development</h4>To help teachers remain professionally active, Stuart Tucker constantly promotes professional development. Indeed, much of what transpires in the course of normal school routine at Green Valley might constitute professional development. For instance, every Wednesday, the school holds faculty meetings where, along with addressing administrative matters, teachers discuss pedagogical, curricular, and assessment issues. Tucker also encourages faculty to keep journals to reflect on various aspects of their work. At the end of each week, Tucker collects these journals and reads each twice, once for understanding and a second time to respond to what teachers have written. He also tries to visit teachers' classes regularly. Describing his role in her professional development, one new teacher commented:<p><blockquote>He plays a big role on our team because the three teachers on my team are new to Green Valley. . . . Stuart helps to direct my thinking, and I have no hesitation to say, "I'm stuck." He never lets me rest and I like that. He meets with us as a team at least once a month. Sometimes, he'll just stop in when we're working together. He's helped us adjust to teaching seventh grade and establishing an exciting and worthwhile curriculum. . . . I've really had to relearn how to plan and teach, to decide what's important in my class. </blockquote>	Tucker also uses summer as a time to help teachers develop professionally by finding funds to allow teaching teams to meet for a week or two to discuss such matters as goals and curricula for the coming school year. Moreover, Tucker has been attentive to his teachers' concerns and uses multiple professional development forums to discuss them. Besides signaling an interest in and respect for teachers' ideas, providing faculty with these multiple forums seems to have had an additional positive effect: the Green Valley staff has evolved a sense of a shared philosophy. <p><h4>Outside Supports </h4>A third apparent reason why change at Green Valley has continued to encompass more of the school is connected to the outside support the school has received. As a "charter" member of the Coalition, for instance, the school has collectively discussed school restructuring at meetings of the Principals' and Coordinators' Council, which are annual CES-sponsored meetings held for all charter members. In addition, like Lewis, Green Valley has participated in the Five School Project. This involvement has provided the school with funding for travel, release time for staff members, and assistance to help the school assess its current efforts and plan for the next steps. <p>	Tucker has also spent a great deal of time and effort seeking grant monies to underwrite his faculty's work. One grant, for example, funded an effort by five Green Valley teachers to develop a flexible schedule that would allow the school to integrate critical thinking skills across the curriculum and develop individual education plans for all students. One summer Green Valley received funding that allowed ten teachers to "define in measurable, performance terms, both entry- and exit-level academic requirements." The following summer Green Valley faculty directed a three-week professional development session on the West Coast aimed at helping teaching teams from other schools jointly develop curricula -- using essential questions8 as the overarching framework. <p>	Moreover, Green Valley teachers frequently serve in this capacity at CES-sponsored activities as well as at other schools' professional development activities. These professional opportunities have played a critical role in the school's restructuring efforts, in part because through the processes of articulating their educational goals, developing materials, organizing workshops, and instructing other teachers, Green Valley teachers have fine-tuned their own abilities and develop deeper insights into their own work.<p><h4>Success Leading to Sustained Reform</h4>The school's relative success at reform may be another reason why changes are being sustained at Green. By 1986, after five years of Tucker and school reform, Green Valley's dropout rate sank to 3 percent and daily attendance rose to over 95 percent. In addition, the number of students who attended college tripled. Three years later, half of Green Valley's graduating class went on to college -- the most ever for Green Valley. Not only could Green Valley offer these signs of relative success, but their success has received wide exposure. The schools' efforts were featured in regional magazines and prominent newspapers, and Tucker was featured in a PBS special.<p><h4>Few External Constraints</h4>Another reason that Green Valley has sustained change appears connected to the lack of resistance these efforts have encountered. In a historically non-union state, for instance, the local teachers' union has had little influence at the school. While at other schools unions have sought a clear delineation of teachers' work responsibilities, the limited union influence at Green Valley has helped Tucker, as he puts it, to "encourage and cajole" his teachers into going beyond the normal eight-to-three routine in providing service to the school and students. The school also had no special programs, such as magnet programs or advanced placement offerings. Departmental ties were weak at Green Valley and have been further weakened as many teachers developed stronger interdisciplinary ties with team members. In changing institutional structures, therefore, there was less likelihood of violating existing interests. <p>	Somewhat related to the fact that there were few entrenched interests at Green Valley was the fact that Stuart Tucker was also able to hire many staff members according to his interests. Because few faculty had tenure (in part, due to Green Valley's difficult recent history combined with a low pay scale), as of the 1991 school year, approximately two-thirds of Green Valley faculty had been hired by Tucker. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="pfre"><h3>Problems Facing Reform Efforts</h3>While the Coalition views Green Valley High as one of its more successful second-step schools, foundations have supported the school's efforts, and the media have generally presented Green Valley's efforts in a positive light, the school has encountered problems in implementing change. Green Valley is a conservative town, and these difficulties have arisen, in part, because some local residents disliked Stuart Tucker's appearance, demeanor, and approach toward education. At school, he never wears a coat and tie, instead preferring flannel shirts. As he had two doctorates, he was considered an intellectual in a town where some residents were skeptical of such "experts." Moreover, some programs implemented during Tucker's tenure were viewed skeptically. Commenting on the tensions stirred up by the school's efforts to alter its previous structure, one faculty member from Green Valley remarked:<p><blockquote>Some people in town . . . feel that doing something different in the school means that we are treating the kids like guinea pigs. Some feel that the high cost of education is tied to our reform-minded teachers. Some school board members have commented that they think the journals that we use in some classes are intrusive into the private life of students.</blockquote>	Eventually, lingering tensions came to a head. In his third year as principal, the school board decided not to renew Tucker's contract. When he challenged their right to do so in court, the reservations that some community members held toward him surfaced. His detractors maintained that Tucker was too liberal and too lenient. For instance, when a junior girl became pregnant and was asked to leave her apprenticeship assignment at a local beauty parlor, Tucker offered her an alternative assignment -- to study community attitudes toward teen pregnancy. <p>	Green Valley's membership in the Coalition of Essential Schools was also viewed with disfavor by those who saw it as a liberal, university-based experiment. After a bitter court battle that ruled in Tucker's favor and a highly contested school board election in which board members supportive of Tucker's ideals were elected, Tucker returned to Green Valley Junior/Senior High as principal. At present, his position appears secure.<p>	One final point: while many of the changes implemented at Green Valley reflect Coalition philosophy, and while the school was among the first to join the Coalition in 1984, this was three years after Tucker had arrived and after many of the reforms discussed here were already under way. In many respects, Coalition membership offered Tucker a means to further his own ideas.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs3"><hr><center><h2>Case Study III:The Wade School</h2></center><hr><p>A growing number of schools are being designed and founded using the nine Common Principles as their underlying philosophy. The first, and one of the most well-known of these schools, the Wade School, is the subject of the final case. The school was founded by Helen Markham, an educator and innovator with a history of involvement in alternative elementary school education. Beginning with approximately 80 seventh-graders in 1985, the school added one grade per year for six years until it reached its present size of approximately 450 students. Wade graduated its first senior class in 1991.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="agdo"><h3>A General Description of Wade</h3>Wade is located in a large urban system which spent, on average, about $6,500 annually per-pupil in the mid-1980s. However, district per-pupil expenditures vary widely, with schools in poorer sections of the city generally receiving less funding. As with Lewis High, this urban system is hier-archical. Nevertheless, a growing range of alternative and magnet programs are available to meet differing needs and to serve specialized populations. While situated in an area of poverty, violence, and joblessness, Wade is part of a subdistrict that is widely acknowledged to favor innovation. The district has supported Wade's administrators, for instance, by assisting with fundraising and providing political support for the fledgling school. <p>	While Wade is an alternative public school and students are selected for admission, Markham has sought to maintain several balances in selecting students.<p><blockquote>We made an early decision that we should be designing a program for every kind of kid. . . . And that the school ought to be mixed: we didn't want all high achievers or all low achievers. The next criteria was that any kid coming out of our elementary schools ought to be allowed to come here because we wanted that continuity. Next, we have a strong focus on families, so we ought to give first preference to the siblings of kids who are already here. . . . Then we have some decisions to make because . . . we want it to be representative of the [city's] population, ethnically, economically, and so forth, but we also wanted to make sure we had enough kids [from this neighborhood].</blockquote>	The Wade School's admissions process is respectful of the criteria Markham outlined. Additionally, prospective students and at least one parent and  must visit the school before the child can enroll. Another balance the school maintains is that 20 percent of the student body are special ed students.<p>	Throughout our research period, the racial and ethnic mix at Wade was approximately 40 percent African-American, 35 percent Hispanic, 9 percent White, 6 percent Asian, and 10 percent biracial. The administration and staff were committed to building a multicultural faculty: approximately one-third of the faculty was African-American. Hispanic teachers represented a growing presence in the school. One source of faculty recruitment has been interns and student teachers from city colleges and universities who volunteer at Wade.<p>	Teachers, administrators, and students frequently use family-like metaphors to characterize the school community. Most stressed the supportiveness, caring, and sense of shared purpose among staff and students. This was perhaps most obvious when talking with Wade's students, who seemed to "own" the Coalition's reform rhetoric and who infused it with an active and pragmatic sense of purpose. Students described themselves as "workers," preparing "exhibitions," and discussed topics that derived from "essential questions" they were studying individually and in groups. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cwtc"><h3>Connections with the Coalition's Philosophy</h3>The school's structure, curriculum, and dominant pedagogical techniques reflect the central aims of Coalition philosophy. Five essential questions guide inquiry in the school in general: How do we know what we know? What's the evidence? Whose viewpoint is represented? How else might it be viewed, seen, considered? and What difference does it make?<p> <p><h4>Innovative Structure</h4>Students are not strictly age-graded, but are taught in classes containing at least two grades. The six years of education offered at Wade are divided into three administrative divisions: what are traditionally seventh and eighth grades are Division One, ninth and tenth grades are Division Two, and the final two years of school are termed the Senior Institute. Each division's curriculum is based on specific essential questions, which, in Divisions One and Two, alternate every two years. <p>	In Divisions One and Two, students have three classes per day: a two-hour humanities blocked class, a two-hour period of math-science (in some instances instruction is interdisciplinary; in most, each subject is taught for one hour during the block), and an advisory period. Students must also demonstrate foreign language competency before graduation and may attend optional Spanish classes before school officially begins each day to help them prepare for the tests. Students in Divisions One and Two perform community service once each week in a three-hour time block. A one-hour lunch break where students can eat and play intramural sports rounds out the formal school day. The building is open for numerous after-school options every day. In addition to de-emphasizing age-grading, organizing the curriculum around essential questions, and stressing active student learning, Wade School emphasizes the Coalition ideas of personalization, "Less is more," staff as generalist, and exhibitions. (See Appendix A.) <p><h4>Personalization</h4>In terms of personalization, no teacher is responsible for more than eighty students and each student is part of an advisory group of ten to fifteen that meets daily with a faculty advisor. The advisor schedules at least two parent-student-teacher conferences per year. To promote continuity in this relationship, students keep their advisors throughout their stay in the division, increasing the knowledge base upon which advice and assessment are based. Further evidence of personalization is the house system: each division includes two houses, each with approximately eighty students and a team of teachers that includes one math, one science, and at least two humanities teachers. These teachers see each student daily in classes that are rarely larger than twenty students. Because teams have the same students for two years, teachers come to know students well and encounter only forty new students in any given year. The house teams meet regularly to discuss students' progress.<p><h4>"Less Is More"</h4>The entire school's philosophy corresponds to the principle of "Less is more." The curriculum has been pared down, students take only a handful of subjects, and each is organized around essential questions. Students do not study all of American history, for instance -- they examine aspects of it in studying revolutions or what it means to be an American. In the Senior Institute they may further specialize in such aspects of American history as the labor movement or Puerto Rican history. <p><h4>Staff as Generalists</h4>The entire staff is expected to function as generalists. While the school offers some psychological and social services, including one full-time school/family coordinator (a trained social worker), classroom teachers fill many guidance roles, and most have studied conflict mediation to help students resolve problems among themselves. All administrators also have advisories and teach when possible. These decisions allow the school to maintain a low student/teacher ratio, while still fulfilling traditional school functions. This generalist principle also functions in the Senior Institute where, through the advisory process, teachers help students find internships that will be appropriate to their planned post-secondary school experiences and help them select colleges or technical schools that will challenge, but not overwhelm, them. <p><h4>Exhibitions </h4>In all aspects of their schooling, students are expected to demonstrate mastery through exhibitions. Students prepare oral and/or written exhibitions for each subject or unit. Some are done individually, others in groups. For their end-of-the year exhibitions, students often present their research findings and draw implications for a team of teachers, parents, or other adults. By the time they enter the Senior Institute, the students have had much practice in the oral and written defense of ideas. <p>	The Senior Institute is designed to provide opportunities for individual students to explore their interests and plan their futures. Senior Institute students may attend classes at Wade, city colleges and universities, and wherever their internships lead them. To complete the Senior Institute students must prepare and defend a set of portfolios which include tasks thatreflect competencies ranging from math, writing, foreign language, and literature to preparing an autobiographical narrative and completing an internship in an area of potential employment interest.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ofsr"><h3>Other Factors Supporting Reform</h3>Several factors have contributed to the ongoing strength of the reform effort at Wade.<p><h4>Leadership</h4>The school owes much to the leadership of its founder, Helen Markham. Her reputation as an educator and her adeptness at building coalitions of supporters and "protectors" is widely acknow-ledged. Markham's style of leadership includes both sharing decision making and protecting her staff from the whims and bureaucracy of city and state educational offices. Teachers often expressed their gratitude for the efforts that Markham exerts to protect the school. One teacher, for instance, said, "She really goes to bat for us downtown; she'll push as hard as she needs to to get us what we want." Further, they often noted with pride the success that Markham has had raising additional funds for the school. <p>	The staff and administration at Wade have allocated tasks to balance the top-down administrative decision making with more grassroots, faculty decision making. For example, curriculum, pedagogical approaches, and methods of assessment are discussed and decided at all levels of the school among teachers and administrators. And while Markham hand-picked the original Wade staff (who spent one year planning and designing the school before it opened), teacher hiring has since been done by teams of teachers. <p><h4>Support from the Coalition</h4>Another source of support for Wade has been the Coalition of Essential School's Central Staff. For several reasons, Ted Sizer and others have spent much time visiting and working at Wade. Wade was the first school designed in terms of Coalition ideas. In addition, the staff regularly requested assistance from the Coalition and attended many Coalition-sponsored professional development activities, including working parties at Brown University, meetings of the Principals' and Coordinators' Council, conferences, and week-long workshops. Third, Wade staff experimented with Coalition ideas and were open about discussing early successes and failures. The staff at Brown valued the Wade faculty's honesty and kept close track of their experiences. Wade was also chosen to participate in the Five Schools Project. Wade teachers and administrators frequently make presentations at the Coalition and other conferences, and the school's new co-director was recently selected to be a Thomson Fellow. Finally, the Coalition has assisted Wade in its efforts to raise funds, and together Helen Markham and Ted Sizer have presented a formidable front when meeting with educators or potential funders. <p><h4>Professional Development</h4>When the Coalition made Wade's state part of a Coalition region, additional local support and professional development activities were created. This regional center is now housed at the school. Wade also received support from the network of elementary schools that Markham had founded and from a growing network of alternative Coalition schools in the city. Teacher education programs from various local institutions have also established working relationships with Wade. <p>	Wade's faculty also runs its own professional development activities -- at least twice a year they have two-day retreats (sometimes with the elementary schools), house teams meet for three hours of curriculum development per week, and half of the weekly faculty meetings are spent discussing pedagogical and curricular issues.<p><h4>Lack of Entrenched Interests</h4>The flexibility of the school's structure results in part from a lack of entrenched interests -- one consequence of being a new school. The few interests defended in early faculty meetings -- community service, the library, and foreign language instruction (Spanish) -- were clearly connected to the school's overarching goals. Additionally, through negotiating with the district and state, many requirements that were viewed as potentially divisive to the school's aims were waived. Finally, because there is a strong sense of shared purpose at the school, teachers who are uncomfortable with the school's structure and/or pedagogical and curricular emphases generally self-select out. <p><h4>A Reputation for Success</h4>Since the school's inception, Wade has enjoyed a highly favorable reputation, in part a consequence of Markham's successful elementary school network. Staff members have taken advantage of the many opportunities offered them to discuss and dis-seminate their philosophy and the program's highlights. They have made presentations (often at Coalition-sponsored activities) and have written articles that describe their work. The school produces a monthly newsletter for parents and interested others. Wade is also very open about allowing researchers and others interested in educational change to visit the school and provides an orientation (staffed by teachers and students) to all visitors.<p>	The more recent successes of its students have also been widely disseminated: All but one member of the first graduating class pursued higher education. While some fifteen or so students did not graduate "on schedule" -- using a traditional definition of schooling --  all persevered in pursuing their degree to completion. Dropout rates at Wade are very low (a total of approximately 5 percent over the four years). Most students who leave Wade continue at other schools; they have not left school altogether. <p><h4>Collaborative Reflection</h4>Faculty and administrators stress that Wade is still "evolving" and that the staff use their time together to reflect upon and reconsider their current activities and future plans. <p>	One example illustrates the work of collective and collaborative reflection and decision making that permeates the school. In an urban environment filled with overt and subtle racial confrontation and innuendo, racial tensions among the faculty and between the faculty and students at Wade seemed ever present and occasionally became the focus of much anger. One of the earliest faculty retreats was devoted to confronting issues related to race and ethnicity. Markham described some reasons for addressing racism head-on and some consequences for the school.<p><blockquote>Last spring we had a retreat in which we tried to frontally discuss the racial tensions among the staff members, and we brought in someone to serve as a moderator. We wanted to discuss resentments and feelings people had about whether white teachers could really teach black kids and other unspoken questions among the faculty. And I just felt with the secondary school you absolutely have to. The kids themselves are going to face it in the world they're going into: dealing with colleges and jobs. And if we can't talk to kids about race we're leaving out too large a dimension. If teachers can't talk to each other about it, how are they going to talk to the kids about it? If white teachers don't know what black teachers feel about things then they're missing a lot. How do we talk about what black parents feel? What's happening when they're having a conference if they're not discussing how that parent is feeling about them as a white teacher. It was important. </blockquote><blockquote>We had an extraordinarily explosive meeting. On the other hand, it broke the ice. There was enough desire of people in the school to make this school succeed so that it wasn't a disaster. If we had done this two years earlier it could have ended the school. </blockquote><blockquote>Well, we followed it up really by taking a step back and approaching it a different way. And we decided to approach it by bringing a conflict resolution program into the school for students, parents, and faculty. To talk more about how you talk about conflict -- how you deal with things that are hard to talk about. And hoping to then move back into [the issue of] racism. For the first whole series of meetings with the staff it was just about conflict and how to position yourself in a conversation when it's difficult. How to talk about things that are difficult. And the last two meetings have been on race. So we are coming into it the back way, and I hope we will be able to get back to the conversation we had last spring.</blockquote>	An important point about this example is how student-centered, responsive, and in many ways daring this retreat was. Tensions ran <i>very </i>high as people of varied backgrounds addressed feelings and reactions they had both in their personal lives and in the Wade School setting. Team members argued about incidents between teachers and students and what they implied about the teacher's racial beliefs. Despite the high levels of stress (and occasional animosity) at the retreat, there was consensus among the faculty that direct, open discussions were a necessary prelude to more "genuine" and "responsive" interactions with students and to a better handling of race and ethnicity in the curriculum. While tensions among individual faculty members have persisted, most felt the school took an enormous risk -- that paid off -- in trying to face racial tensions directly and respectfully. <p>	Unlike our other sites, there were few concerns about preferential treatment or job security at Wade. At most, accusations of preferential treatment were directed at faculty who were the earliest spokespersons for the school in public presentations. Any job security issues, like so many problems Wade faces, result from budget deficits in the citywide system. They never threatened people's loyalty to Wade -- rather the problems often increased people's commitment to the school's efforts.<p><h4>Criticisms of Wade</h4>Of course the school has its detractors. One of the more commonly heard criticisms is that because foundation grants supplement the citywide per pupil allocation, it cannot serve as a general model for schools wishing to restructure. Others are skeptical of its serving as a general model because of its admission requirements -- most notably the agreement of students to be active participants in the life of the school with their parents agreeing to actively participate on their child's behalf. <p>	The school, by its faculty and administration's own admissions, struggles with many difficult problems -- but one difference between this school and many others is that problems usually become the object of serious reflection by the whole staff, not simply of idle gossip in the faculty room. Further, the sense of student involvement in schoolwork, the school's mission, and their ownership of the reform language at Wade results from the close and careful articulation of Coalition philosophy with all aspects of the school's design and approach to curriculum, instruction, and assessment. <p>	One gets the sense at this school that everyone -- administrators, teachers, students, and parents -- is pulling together for all community members and that there is a commitment to ongoing reflection that will be a continuing part of the school's overall "evolution."<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cp"><hr><center><h2>Comparative Perspectives</h2></center><hr><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="char"><h3>Characteristics</h3>The three schools described in the preceding cases share eight characteristics in terms of their reform efforts:<p><h4>Characteristic #1</h4>The principals are strong leaders who are vocally supportive of the restructuring efforts. For instance, principals at these three schools have taken advantage of faculty hiring opportunities, turn-over, and loss of staff due to declining enrollments to retain and hire those faculty members who expressed interest in pursuing reform goals. They are also respected by most faculty members. While at other schools faculty often resisted change efforts because of the principal's close association with these efforts, these principals have persuaded faculty to participate in the reforms. <p>	Furthermore, these principals were committed to change even before their formal affiliation with the Coalition. In many respects, the Coalition provided them with an avenue to realize their pre-existing ideas about school restructuring. In addition, these principals have been at their schools through-out the period of restructuring. Our five other study schools all experienced some administrative turnover. <p><h4>Characteristic #2 </h4>There were few pre-existing interests in place at these schools prior to the reform. These schools had no magnet programs, no extensive advanced placement offerings, no powerful union presence, nor did they have other special interests that might have felt threatened and/or resisted efforts to restructure. <p><h4>Characteristic #3 </h4>None of these schools had a reputation for academic excellence. Two schools had substantial at-risk populations, relatively high dropout rates, and few students who went on to college. The third school, since it was new and built grade-by-grade, had no prior reputation, but was located in a city with a poor reputation for public schooling. It is important to keep these conditions in mind when considering each school's reports of success. While both pre-existing schools have reported impressive gains or comparisons in student attendance and college attendance, these should be viewed in the context of the conditions at the schools and/or their troubled school systems prior to Coalition membership. <p><h4>Characteristic #4 </h4>The Central Staff invested in these schools far more than most member schools -- possibly because these schools reported regularly on their efforts and specifically requested Central Staff assistance. In supporting these schools, the Central Staff did not direct the schools' work; rather, they tended to do whatever they could to support the schools' self-initiated efforts, one of the Central Staff's ways of demonstrating respect for local autonomy. Also, because the Coalition Central Staff perceived these schools to be doing some of the more ambitious reform work, they were often "showcased" in CES symposia, workshops, and public relations efforts. Finally, these schools attended many Coalition-sponsored professional development activities. As a result of the interaction between the Central Staff and these particular schools, teachers at these schools generally viewed Central Staff members positively, as persons with something to offer them and as encouraging of their efforts -- almost as mentors. <p><h4>Characteristic #5 </h4>These three schools sponsored and ran their own professional development activities which built on aspects of Coalition philosophy and promoted a sense of common purpose among all staff members.<p><h4>Characteristic #6</h4>Each of the three schools took steps to support the efforts of teachers directly involved in their restructuring efforts. These included creating common planning time for involved faculty to meet jointly and securing funds so participants could attend Coalition-sponsored workshops. Further, these schools took advantage of multiple opportunities -- faculty meetings, professional development activities, and team meetings, for example -- to develop and promote a shared vision or common philosophy among the staff and other members of the school community. <p><h4>Characteristic #7</h4>Each of these schools raised extra funds from foundations to support their restructuring efforts and received funds from the Coalition to encourage their own school-based change efforts and to work with like-minded school personnel.<p><h4>Characteristic #8</h4>Each school used mounting evidence of its success to build further support for its work.<p>	Abstracting from these common characteristics, four points are worth noting. First, school reform at these three sites was multidimensional and provided many different opportunities for school personnel to become involved.9 Second, there were both external (e.g., Central Staff expertise) and internal (e.g., planning time, school-based professional development, etc.) supports for these change efforts. Third, these schools invested substantial time in allowing all school personnel to rethink many previously unchallenged assumptions about schools throughout the restructuring process -- in planning for change, in monitoring the effectiveness of their efforts at change, and in re-envisioning what it might take to deepen their efforts. Finally, the three schools all allocated significant amounts of time, money, and effort toward helping teachers acquire the skills needed to sustain and deepen their work -- not only as it applied to their classroom, but also as it applied to collaboration with colleagues, interactions with parents, and to their expanded roles as advisors. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="impl"><h3>Implications</h3>We briefly discuss three implications of these cases. First, if as the Coalition states these schools are exemplary in their active commitment to change, systemic school change efforts may be more likely to endure and deepen. By <i>systemic </i>we mean moving on many fronts at once  -- the classroom, the school, the district -- and involving multiple actors -- teachers, students, administrators, and parents -- in sizable numbers as these schools have each attempted to do. A simultaneously top-down and grassroots approach built on a shared vision has seemed to yield continuity in dealing with students, less reform-minded others, and the local community. Additionally, while structural and attitudinal constraints can make it difficult for students to be active participants in the change process, where this has been nurtured, it too has seemed to sustain and deepen classroom and schoolwide changes. In each of these three schools, there appeared to be at least an implicit acknowledgment of the importance of three factors that contribute to systemic change: the schools have created structures that would support school reform, i.e., the <i>actions </i>supportive of change; they focused on discussing and defining the philosophical and pedagogical assumptions that undergird these actions, i.e., the <i>beliefs </i>that underlie the specific reforms and the goals of change; and they have created opportunities, often in conjunction with the Coalition, to help faculty and administrators develop the <i>skills </i>that will help them implement their philosophy. <p>	Second, where professional development has been made a part of the life of the school itself, rather than a one-shot deal every twelve or fourteen weeks, it has appeared to contribute to deepening the school's reform efforts. This seems particularly true when professional development has been closely tied to schoolwide goals. <p>	Finally, because of the difficulties of school change, it seems critical to seek outside perspectives while developing, implementing, and assessing a school's efforts at change. It is sometimes difficult for school personnel to distance themselves from the effects of change and the political climate within which they act. Outsiders can offer a distanced perspectives on events and their likely effects.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>Notes</h3></center><hr><ol><p><li> Difficulties faced by the Coalition schools whose reform efforts have proven more problematic are discussed in Muncey and McQuillan (1992).<p><li> A Study of High Schools generated three books: <i>Horace's Compromise </i>(1984) by Sizer; <i>The Shopping Mall High School </i>(1985) by Arthur Powell, Eleanor Farrar, and David Cohen; and <i>The Last Little Citadel </i>(1986) by Robert Hampel.<p><li> We provide no specific reference for this citation (and others throughout the case studies) because it might jeopardize the confidentiality we promised our study schools. <p><li> This contrasts with most of our study schools where program coordinators generally had teaching responsibilities in addition to their administrative work. <p><li> Although Lewis's SWAS students have done relatively well on these exams, the school's flexible schedule allows them to prepare students intensively for these exams, an opportunity non-SWAS students at Lewis and other city students do not have. In addition, Lewis's SWAS students, especially the first cohort, were not an "average" group of Lewis students. An independent study of Lewis's SWAS found: <blockquote>The evidence shows that <i>going </i>in the students begin with sizable advantages over other Lewis students; they are younger, thus more likely to have been promoted on time at each earlier grade in their respective histories; and second, the students turn out to have had much better attendance rates his-torically than their non-Coalition counterparts at Lewis have had. An objective observer might argue then that the Coalition students are in fact the most likely students to succeed anyway -- in whatever enrichment environment they are in or not in.</blockquote>	While voicing these caveats, the report added that, after controlling for differences in student characteristics, <blockquote>the thrust of the evidence is that participation in the SWAS program at Lewis increases a student's school attendance and promotion rates, which are important behaviors linked to school academic achievement and graduation.</blockquote><p><li> Although the SWAS has cited these figures as a sign of success, other faculty members contend that the SWAS manipulates these figures by first enrolling SWAS dropouts in the larger school before they are discharged.<p><li> The problems four SWAS Coalition schools encountered when they tried to expand are compared in McQuillan and Muncey (1991).<p><li> "Essential questions" are a curricular framework promoted by the Coalition (see Wiggins 1987). In contrast to the common curricular focus on coverage, essential questions are intended to focus curriculum on a specific topic in depth. In part, essential questions represent an effort to strike a balance between process and content in curricular organization -- that is, acknowledging that teachers cannot cover everything but also acknowledging that focusing purely on process is equally inadequate. <p><li> Cusick (1991) for instance, argues that most effective efforts at school change have been systemic and multidimensional.<p></ol><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="refe"><hr><center><h2>References</h2></center><hr>Cusick, Philip. 1991. <i>The Educational System, Its Nature and Logic. </i>New York: McGraw-Hill.<p>Firestone, William, Susan Fuhrman, and Michael Kirst. 1989. <i>The Progress of Reform: An Appraisal of State Educational Initiatives. </i>New Brunswick, NJ: Center for Policy Research, Rutgers University.<p>Fiske, Edward. 1991.<i> Smart Schools, Smart Kids</i>.

The words of Mary Futrell, past president of the National Education Association, summarize this perspective:<p><blockquote>We are finally arriving at a consensus on the need for meaningful reform of U.S. schools and on the direction which that reform should take. . . . We have forged a new consensus on the necessity of providing a high-quality education to all children. We have also come to realize that achievement of that goal will require a radical re-formation of our schools. If we can hold on to this consensus and build around it a new coalition -- characterized by mobility -- we will finally be ready to undertake the hard work of meaningful education reform. (Futrell 1989: 10)</blockquote>	Despite claims that schools are failing our children and our society and concomitant calls for change that have filled the public media and education journals for years,1 we found that many teachers and administrators in the schools we studied did not think that their schools or their personal situations needed to be changed. Further, whether they wanted school reform or not, teachers in our study schools would not agree with Futrell's optimistic assessment of the existence of a forged consensus. <p>	Assuming there is a consensus regarding the need for school reform has powerful ramifications for efforts at reform and for their eventual outcomes. That is, assuming there is consensus, and therefore support, for change obscures powerful factors that strongly influence the change process and leaves proponents unprepared to deal with opposition when it arises. School restructuring is a political process, and insufficient attention to this point from the start can prove detrimental to the educational dimensions of restructuring and to the school as a whole. <p>	Drawing on four years of ethnographic research at eight "Coalition" schools and with the Central Staff of the Coalition of Essential Schools (CES), we discuss a common pattern that emerged at seven of the schools, which derived from the assumption of consensus. With the support of the school's administration and the superintendent's office or Board of Trustees, a faculty "vanguard" initiated what they perceived to be the first stage of what would eventually become a more encompassing restructuring effort. This vanguard assumed that those who at first were disinterested would eventually become supporters. These early efforts, rather than building support, quickly became enmeshed in the political life of the school, raised issues of teacher equity and school and personal philosophy, and did little to promote comprehensive, schoolwide change.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tcoe"><h3>THE COALITION OF ESSENTIAL SCHOOLS </h3>The Coalition of Essential Schools was founded in 1984 by Theodore R. Sizer, former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and former headmaster at Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts. Coalition philosophy is the product of thinking, research, and writing that emerged from a five-year, multisite study of American secondary schools, A Study of High Schools.2 <p>	Drawing on his experiences in schools and the general shortcomings he perceived in American education, Sizer wrote a compelling narrative about his findings, <i>Horace's Compromise</i>, and devised a philosophy, codified in the Common Principles that have formed the basis for the Coalition. These principles urge schools to maintain an intellectual focus, to concentrate on academic essentials ("less is more"), to acknowledge and meet the diverse needs of all students, to personalize learning, to promote trust and decency, to make students active learners, to see teachers as generalists, to judge mastery by demonstrated exhibition, and to maintain an 80-to-1 student-teacher ratio while keeping per pupil expenditures within 10 percent of existing costs (see <p>Appendix A).<p>	Prior to and at the time of his book's publication, Sizer and his associates made numerous speeches promoting his philosophy (Hampel, 1990). Based on what he perceived as an enthusiastic reception for his ideas among the teachers and school administrators he met, Sizer recruited schools willing to experiment with his philosophy and put together a small, university-based staff to assist this effort. From an initial membership of twelve charter schools in December of 1985 and a Central Staff of three persons, the Coalition has grown to include over 140 schools nationwide (Sizer 1991) and a Central Staff that now numbers nearly forty persons. <p>	In proclaiming the diversity of its membership, the Coalition stresses that it is a grassroots reform movement focused on improving classroom teaching and learning and helping students to "use their minds well." Unlike many reform efforts, the Coalition emphatically rejects centralized and standardized solutions to school problems. Moreover, the nine Common Principles that form the foundation of this reform are ambiguous by design: each member school is to interpret and act upon the principles within its own cultural and institutional context.<p>	To understand the political tensions that arose in our case studies, it will help to keep three aspects of Coalition reform in mind. First, as with the national rhetoric, the Coalition, too, assumes that change is needed. Second, by promoting an intellectual focus as the basis to their reform ideology and stressing the idea of the triangle of learning (i.e., the relationship between the student, teacher, and subject matter) as a school's most important priority, the Coalition Central Staff and member schools, at first, overlooked the political issues associated with school reform. Third, the Coalition asserts that a strength of its reform program is that there is no single model for change; instead, it emphasizes local interpretation of the Common Principles.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="tsep"><h3>THE SCHOOL ETHNOGRAPHY PROJECT </h3>The School Ethnography Project began a multiyear ethnographic documentation and research effort focused on the schools and staff that were partners in the Coalition of Essential Schools in August of 1986 -- when schools were still in the initial stages of their restructuring efforts. Data collection concluded in June of 1990. Our research did not involve a formal educational evaluation of the Coalition of Essential Schools; rather, we sought to document broadly what occurred as a consequence of the Coalition's reform efforts. To accomplish this documentation, we collected data on four interrelated components of the reform movement: <p><ol>	<li>	individual schools involved in the project<p>	<li>	the Central Staff's activities and the role(s) they played in developing the movement's philosophy;<p>	<li>	the interaction between the Central Staff and the individual Coalition schools at workshops, symposia, and conferences; and<p>	<li>	the developmental history of the Coalition itself.</ol> <p>	The majority of our research was conducted in individual schools and focused on two broad ques-tions: How are the Common Principles interpreted by individual schools? And how do those involved in Coalition schools (teachers, administrators, and students) implement the principles as they are developed in each setting? We consciously included an array of perspectives in our research -- for example, Central Staff members, students, teachers, and administrators in CES schools, including both supporters and opponents of Coalition philosophy and practices. <p>	We will now look at three schools that adopted different approaches to Coalition reform -- a school-within-a-school (SWAS) effort, a whole-school effort, and a school that never went beyond planning for its Coalition program -- to illustrate the emergence of common difficulties in these diverse school settings. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs1"><hr><center><h2>Case Study I:<br>Silas Ridge High School</h2></center><hr>Silas Ridge is an Eastern city of 65,000 inhabitants. Located in the heart of the city, Silas Ridge High School3 is a comprehensive high school that serves a student population of slightly more than 1,000 students. Academically, most students are grouped according to a five-tier tracking system -- advanced placement through basic. Although historically most students have been white and middle class, in recent years Silas Ridge has enrolled increasing numbers of minority and immigrant students, primarily Southeast Asians and Eastern Europeans. Between 1983 and 1987, Silas Ridge won numerous awards for excellence.<p>	Silas Ridge High School's relationship with CES was initiated by a school committee member who became familiar with Ted Sizer's ideas through her graduate work. As part of the professional development activities of the city Teachers' Association, Sizer was invited to speak to faculty members from both district high schools. Following his talk, and with encouragement from a supportive superintendent, the "Sizer Committee," a volunteer group of teachers from Silas Ridge High that included a woman who would soon become the school's principal, explored the possibilities of Coalition membership, then authored an application to CES. In January of 1985, Silas Ridge High School became a "charter" member of the Coalition of Essential Schools. <p>	Silas Ridge spent the next year and a half (from January of 1985 through the summer of 1986) planning its Coalition program. This process had five primary components: 1) sponsoring and attending professional development activities intended to promote school change; 2) investigating other schools' attempts at restructuring; 3) creating new structures and positions to facilitate the change process (such as a Steering Committee to direct Coalition-related work and a Coordinator to oversee this work); 4) consulting and collaborating with the Coalition Central Staff; and 5) generating support for their Coalition effort (through holding faculty dinner "seminars" and meeting with the School Committee, for instance). Two final points about the planning phase are significant: first, in order to participate, faculty and administrators had to assume additional responsibilities to their existing workloads; and second, to avoid forcing disinterested faculty into becoming involved or accepting responsibilities they had never sought, no one was required to participate in any Coalition-related activity, all involvement was voluntary.<p>	In translating Coalition philosophy into practice, Silas Ridge High adopted a school-within-a-school (SWAS) structure, with the intent of gradually expanding the program's size. In its first year the Coalition program consisted of a team of four teachers (from the English, history, math, and science departments) who taught the same eighty ninth-grade students -- two general-level classes, one college preparatory class, and one honors class. These teachers taught four periods each day, had two periods to plan with their Essential School colleagues, and one free period. (Most of their larger-school colleagues had five teaching periods, one supervisory period, and one free period.) To help administer the program, an assistant principal served as Coalition Coordinator. During the program's first year, there was also a "shadow" Coalition team of four teachers who represented the same disciplines and participated in SWAS-related work and who would form a second SWAS team when the program expanded, as planned, the following year. <p>	In its first year, the SWAS proved relatively uncontroversial for the school as a whole. Most Coalition teachers preferred the SWAS structure to their previous teaching situations and felt that they and their students benefited from both this structure and from their efforts at interdisciplinary teaching, heterogeneous grouping, and cooperative learning. Yet internally the team encountered problems. Some team members, for example, were more enthusiastic than others about grouping students heterogeneously, changing the schedule, or experimenting in general. Cooperation became increasingly difficult. Furthermore, one teacher's personal problems had a powerful impact on the team and strained the team's energy and enthusiasm. <p>	There were two common reactions to the Coalition SWAS among the rest of the school's faculty. First, when polled, nearly half the faculty expressed a willingness to assist the program in various capacities (e.g., as a participant in professional development activities, offering professional assistance to the program, etc.), but few volunteered to be actively involved. Second, faculty viewed the SWAS as an interesting experiment. <p>	In its second year (1987-88), the SWAS expanded to include four more teachers and an additional eighty students. During the first quarter, the Coalition program experienced some unexpected faculty turnover; and since the assistant principal found it difficult to add SWAS-related business to her other responsibilities, a teacher from the shadow team, a relative newcomer to Silas Ridge High, became the Coordinator.<p>	During this second year, both the SWAS program and the Coalition Steering Committee expanded -- the latter in part because of a controversy about the SWAS program. The previous spring, the Steering Committee voted to expand the SWAS. Since the program would also continue to enroll general, college, and honors students SWAS faculty were guaranteed to have a second group of the school's honors students, a contentious issue for some Silas Ridge faculty who viewed teaching honors sections as a professional privilege. When some non-SWAS teachers realized that this expansion could limit the number of honors sections available to them, they voiced their concerns to the administration. The administration, however, was adamant that this decision would stand. These teachers then decided to mobilize other faculty members to monitor the workings of the Steering Committee, to ensure that similar developments would not recur. Resistant faculty members, who were influential, experienced, and respected, then joined the Steering Committee. <p>	Whereas during the first year of implementation the Steering Committee focused on aspects of the triangle of learning, its work thereafter became much more politically charged. One opponent of the SWAS and Silas Ridge's Coalition affiliation described her role as a new member of the Steering Committee:<p><blockquote>The second full year that [the school-within-a-school] was in place, I joined the Steering Committee. . . . I went to every meeting. I am not a negative person. I work <i>for </i>things. I work <i>with </i>people. . . . But I spent one year as a member of a two-person team of hinder, stall, and delay. And we hindered, stalled, and we delayed that Coalition school-within-a-school right into the ground. We questioned every vote. . . . We made them accountable for who was involved and what was involved, the reasons behind the changes.</blockquote>	As the year progressed, faculty divisiveness and disaffection with the SWAS program and structure worsened. The dispute over assigning the SWAS a second honors section was only one of myriad concerns faculty expressed. Many faculty con-tended that the SWAS teachers received preferential treatment. As one teacher commented: "We had some teachers who had eighty students, no duties, and fewer classes. How could anybody think that that wouldn't create tension?" These accusations were exacerbated by perceptions among the faculty that the principal hired only those persons who were philosophically compatible with her ideals. <p>	Additionally, some questioned whether this effort represented a democratic change coming from the faculty or an administrative mandate driven by the principal and a core of teachers. As one teacher said: "The perception within the school was that it's not coming from the faculty; it's coming from the principal." Although all agreed that faculty members had been involved in each stage of the planning process, some faculty maintained that the process excluded those teachers who could not attend the voluntary before- and after-school meetings so critical to this reform effort. Still others contended that the faculty never voted about whether to be affiliated with the Coalition, nor on the "form" of their Coalition involvement. In the words of one teacher: "What started out as tacit agreement -- because why would you be against change; why would you be against improvement? -- all of a sudden turned into a school-within-a-school. And that was not voted on by the full faculty."<p>	A third source of resistance and resentment by those not directly involved concerned what they viewed as an implicit criticism of their conventional teaching practices embedded in Coalition rhetoric (e.g., teachers are lecturing too much). One experienced teacher who was not involved in the SWAS remarked in a newspaper article that reflected on these tense times:<p><blockquote>Whether it was real or perceived, I don't know, but there was a feeling that what [older] teachers were doing and had been doing was not good and should be changed, and the new people were doing things right. You just can't suddenly say to people who thought that they were doing a good job all along that what you're doing is all wrong.</blockquote>	Finally, during the course of the restructuring, there was a growing sense that SWAS members and the Coalition Steering Committee (the first Silas Ridge governance body with formal power) were now exerting power within the whole school and becoming prominent and identified with success in the local community. And many of those perceived to be the most supportive of Silas Ridge's Coalition work were women with Ivy League educations new to the community. Thus, it was commonly perceived that a clique of relative newcomers was now changing Silas Ridge High.<p>	Recognizing the problems, in February 1988 the Steering Committee voted to abandon the SWAS structure and "to encourage innovation and creativity among the entire staff." The school-within-a-school then became the "teacher teaming project," just one of several Steering Committee efforts. That spring, the faculty created the Faculty Forum, a faculty governance committee intended to ensure faculty input into any restructuring efforts. Recommended after a needs assessment, done as part of an application for a restructuring grant from the State Department of Education, the Faculty Forum was a seven-person committee elected by the faculty and given authority subject to the principal's veto. Subsequent to the formation of the Faculty Forum, the Coalition Steering Committee was dissolved. Some people argued that the creation of the Forum was merely an effort by those opposed to the principal or the SWAS to limit the power of both the Coalition Steering Committee and the principal. So although officially tied to the grant application, the creation of the Forum also signaled the faculty's disaffection with both their principal and the somewhat unanticipated effects of the SWAS expansion. <p>	Silas Ridge's Coalition program spent the next three years in a state of limbo. The Forum named a Coalition Subcommittee to maintain contact with the Coalition Central Staff, to attend Coalition-sponsored events, and to inform the faculty of Coalition-related developments. During the 1988-89 school year, in the name of the Coalition, there was an effort made to allow interested teachers throughout the building to team, but in practice, it proved difficult to promote teaming on such an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, and few teaming proposals were ever implemented. <p>	In 1989-90, Silas Ridge had one interdisciplinary team of three teachers (two of whom were members of the Coalition Subcommittee) who taught a humanities course, but perhaps more important, the school held a faculty referendum on whether to remain in the Coalition. When the vote was taken, there was faculty endorsement for Coalition affiliation, yet only one-fourth of the faculty expressed a desire to actively participate in Coalition work at the school. Membership continued in 1990-91, following the departure of the principal, but it remained uncertain what the future direction of Coalition involvement would be. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs2"><hr><center><h2>Case Study II:<br>Barrett Preparatory School</h2></center><hr>Barrett Preparatory School is a small K-12 private school in a large, multicultural metropolitan area. A strong commitment to minority recruitment on the part of the administration has meant that the sizable Greek, Italian, and Soviet Jewish populations at the school have been complemented by an increasing number of African-American students. The student body is heterogeneous in ability as well. Members of the administration often cited the students' needs for personal attention as their primary reason for attending Barrett. Some attend the private school as an alternative to a heavily criticized public system, while others attend on merit scholarships. Some have had problems at other schools. Most students plan to attend college and, increasingly, the school has placed students in more desirable colleges and universities.<p>	Barrett's first contact with the Coalition resulted from the arrival of a new headmaster at the school in the fall of 1984. During the first year of the new headmaster's tenure, the faculty read <i>The Paideia Proposal </i>(Adler 1982) and <i>Horace's Compromise </i>(Sizer 1984) and other books about educational philosophy and school change and formed a committee to consider reform. Towards the end of the school year the headmaster prepared the Barrett Educational Plan, a statement of the school's guiding philosophy. It was discussed among the faculty and formally accepted by the school's Board of Trustees. One teacher said:<p><blockquote>[The headmaster] came in with a structure [for] the school because the school was really amorphous. It had no structure. It had no goals. It was floundering academically, student-population-wise; there weren't fewer students, but the quality of the students was very poor. The kids came here just because their parents didn't want them to go to public school. [The headmaster] came in and had a vision and set up this core curriculum. It happened about the same time Sizer's [1984] and Adler's [1982] books came out and it seemed to fit and <i>so basically, it was all  the headmaster's idea because, as a faculty, we were just no place. </i>It had been turmoil the year before. </blockquote>	Because the Barrett Educational Plan was similar in intent to the Coalition's Common Principles, the headmaster approached Sizer at a national meeting of independent schools about joining the soon-to-be-formed Coalition. Barrett was accepted as one of the earliest member schools in 1985.<p>	Most of the faculty (still at the school in 1986 when this research began) described themselves as enthusiastic about the initial change-related discussions. For various reasons, however, many became resistant to the changes as they were implemented during the next school year (1985-86). One reason was that the schedule created to institutionalize the new educational plan called for each of the four core subjects (math, science, English, and history) to be taught by teams of teachers in a lecture, seminar, and tutorial arrangement. Concerns abounded about how the teaming would be accomplished, whether the seminar and tutorial periods would be productive, and who would be responsible for grading students. According to one administrator:<p><blockquote>The teachers were unsure about what was going to happen in seminars and they were really concerned about coverage of material. The math and history people were the biggest on coverage. They were really upset that they would not have enough time to cover the material as they previously had because of the seminars.</blockquote>	Other teachers felt their disciplines to be threatened by the Coalition philosophy as incorporated into the Barrett plan. One teacher said:<p><blockquote>The way it was presented . . . almost made it seem like the Coalition did not feel that modern languages, art, or music were as important as the four core courses. </blockquote>Another said:<p><blockquote>The first year, I think it was exciting because a lot of ideas were being thought about, about how we could be at the forefront of educational reform. I only found out later on that languages, my area, really is on the periphery . . . that the headmaster never really saw languages as being part of the plan. We were more or less tacked onto the schedule.</blockquote>	The emphasis placed on student-centered pedagogical techniques such as Socratic questioning raised other concerns. Some teachers felt that this was just one successful technique they used in their daily teaching and that other techniques were being unjustly criticized as ineffective. One English teacher summed up this position: <p><blockquote>As a seminar teacher I felt I had been told that there was just one kind of teaching that I was to be doing and that was what Mortimer Adler recommended and the kinds of things . . . that Sizer recommended. So that meant that as a teacher who had been successful using a full arsenal of things, . . . [I was now told to use only] the Socratic method. I felt limited.</blockquote>	While the administration was aware of these criticisms, they felt it was appropriate to stress the Socratic method to the exclusion of other approaches in the seminar classes.<p>	Between 1986 and 1990 the turnover of teachers in the secondary school was substantial. But a small group of teachers committed to or interested in the ideas of the Coalition continued attending conferences and workshops and offering professional development activities for their fellow faculty members. They were surprised and discouraged by the resistance they encountered as they attempted to "help" the faculty operationalize student-as-worker and personalization in their classroom practice. <p>	In 1987-88 some of the criticisms faculty raised about the schedule were addressed by removing the tutorial period, reducing the number of lectures for each core course and adding an additional seminar period. Additionally, this reduced the number of people on each of the teams and reduced the number of preparations for each teacher. Many faculty were pleased that their input had been considered and acted upon. However, criticisms about emphasizing student-centered pedagogies, less-is-more rhetoric (and its apparent contradiction with the exceedingly demanding curriculum the school listed for each grade level) and problems that teachers had coordinating their efforts to team remained. <p>	In 1988-89 at the request of the faculty, the schedule of the school changed again. All English and history classes were blocked back-to-back five periods per week. The same was true for math and science courses. Additionally, each interdisciplinary pair had two single periods for lesson presentations. Teachers argued that this schedule furthered student-centered pedagogies and promoted "teacher-as-generalist." It also meant that while they taught two subjects to the same group of students, they now teamed with even fewer teachers and had fewer preparations.4 Some teachers prepared interdisciplinary curricula for their classes; others divided the ninety-minute period into the respective English and history or math and science periods and taught the two subjects as distinct. In other words, while the headmaster saw these changes as improving and institutionalizing a schedule that emphasized student-as-worker and personalization, resistant teachers saw it as a slow return to previous practices, particularly because of the decline in expected teaming -- even though there were expectations that teachers working with the same grade level would "coordinate" their efforts. Both views could comfortably interpret the changes made as supporting their position.<p>	Complaints about the lowly status of all subjects other than the four core courses were continuous throughout the implementation of various schedules. No changes were made to accommodate the objections of these teachers or others who supported them. The continually high turnover in faculty at the school meant that new faculty, who voiced support for the Coalition ideas as codified in the school's educational plan, could be hired. <p>	In 1989-90 some adjustments again were made in the schedule. A limited number of electives in the upper grades were offered. This made interdisci-plinary pairing difficult, so the math and science courses at the junior and senior levels reverted back to being independently scheduled. An advisory period was added for grades 6 to 11. The scheduling of the English/history classes and the non-core subjects was unchanged. In June 1990, the headmaster and two of the most vocal proponents for change at the school left to take new jobs. <p>	Resistance to Coalition philosophy and the schedule have been intertwined at this school from the start. Barrett, a small school, was one of the few schools that attempted to change the entire secondary school simultaneously. However, the effort was hampered by a lack of clarity about the overall goals of the reform. One teacher said that early in their efforts the "faculty . . . gave some degree of lip service to the reform, but . . . they didn't understand the nature of the reforms partly because of the way the reform was implemented." Faculty did not feel prepared to teach differently simply because the schedule changed. And as another teacher said, scheduling decisions "became" the embodiment of the Coalition at Barrett:<p><blockquote>I don't think we can really separate the two from one another. We were all introduced to the Coalition principles at the same time all the new changes in scheduling were made along with cutting back on electives, etc. . . . so they really go hand-in-hand. . . . [P]eople who were upset with the removal of electives or change in the schedule, as a result . . . became anti-Coalition.</blockquote>	No movement was ever made to reconsider membership in the Coalition at Barrett, partly because the school was struggling to survive when it joined and received some much-needed favorable publicity as a result of its Coalition membership. Those most opposed to the Coalition left or were asked to leave the school throughout the change process (unlike public schools, teachers at Barrett have a one-year contract). Those still at the school learned the language of the Coalition and, regardless of their personal beliefs about the philosophy, were comfortable using it. In private, the terms frequently were used in unflattering comparisons or jokes. <p>	With the departure of the headmaster and the arrival of a successor whose views about the Coalition and its philosophy were unknown, it was uncertain whether the schedule modifications that have characterized this school's operationalization of Coalition philosophy will continue. The new headmaster arrived again at a time of fiscal crisis for the school -- an expensive addition to the physical plant and the local effects of the current recession on enrollment have pushed the school into a precarious financial situation. Whether the course charted by the previous headmaster continues and how the faculty who have had mixed reactions to the changes to date react to the departure of the school's most vocal proponents of Coalition remains to be seen. At the end of five years of Coalition membership, then, it is unclear how much genuine support for Coalition philosophy exists in the school, but it is certainly apparent that passive resistance as well as outright opposition have characterized the attempts at change undertaken thus far.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cs3"><hr><center><h2>Case Study III:<br>Elliston High School</h2></center><hr>Elliston High School is part of the Elliston Central School District, located just outside a medium-sized northern city. There are approximately 25,000 residents in the school district, and the suburban communities from which the school's 1,000 students are drawn are both primarily white-collar, middle-to-upper-middle class. The high school boasts high completion rates, for example, 98.5 percent in 1982-83. Most students (85-90 percent) pursue higher education. Elliston's curriculum is broadly comprehensive, and there are numerous opportunities for extracurricular activities, independent study, and technical work. The high school offers several advanced placement courses as part of its tracked system and has won numerous awards for excellence. <p>	Elliston's first contact with the Coalition of Essential Schools occurred during an informational meeting in December 1984. Between 1984 and 1986 the Elliston principal and interested faculty engaged in activities to increase their awareness and understanding of Coalition philosophy and practice. These included faculty seminars that explored Coalition ideas, a visit by Ted Sizer, participation in Coalition summer workshops, and the creation of a "Sizer Study Committee" to consider the implications of Coalition affiliation.<p>	In February 1986 the Sizer Committee distributed a proposal for Coalition membership to the Elliston faculty that emphasized six of the nine Common Principles: intellectual focus, simple goals, personalization, student-as-worker, graduation by exhibition, and an atmosphere of respect and decency. The Committee also summarized what the principles implied for them and stressed that the "same level of commitment will not be required of the entire faculty." <p>	In a survey/vote in April of 1986, faculty affirmed their support for the six principles <i>as outlined by the Sizer Committee </i>(75-14), as well as for allowing interested faculty to implement these principles through Coalition membership (53-29). Yet on their response forms, twenty-two faculty members said they were not presently interested in the project; twenty-two said they were interested but lacked the time to participate; fifteen wanted more information; and thirty-one volunteered to help plan the program. In November 1986 the Elliston School Board voted to join the Coalition. To direct this effort two co-coordinators were appointed. <p>	The 1986-87 school year was primarily used to plan, because Elliston was on double sessions at the junior high school while the high school was being renovated. In 1987-88, the co-coordinators organized a school and community project based on Coalition practice, created a Steering Committee, provided teachers with opportunities for professional development, published an occasional newsletter, and developed a pilot program for implementation in 1988-89. In addition, one coordinator wrote: "We have decided to narrow our scope to three of the nine Common Principles . . . 1) Less is More, 2) Student as Worker and 3) Decency." Beyond this work, each co-coordinator continued to experiment with his or her own interpretations of Coalition pedagogy and presented their work at various Coalition symposia. A few other Elliston teachers also experimented with their teaching and several teachers and administrators from Elliston attended Coalition workshops. <p>	Although the co-coordinators felt progress was being made in these areas, opposition to Coalition affiliation also emerged. In the fall of 1987, one teacher who described himself as philosophically opposed to Sizer's ideas and skeptical of their practical feasibility, circulated to all faculty members copies of an article that derided the process approach to learning as ignoring context and questioned whether the Coalition might have similar problems. Other faculty questioned the procedure used for joining the Coalition -- was there a vote or not? Also, issues of faculty divisiveness and concerns about how to provide nonthreatening support for colleagues arose repeatedly. <p>	Late in the spring of 1988 the Coalition Steering Committee suggested that a school-within-a-school format might be an appropriate structure for piloting Coalition ideas. But at a Steering Committee meeting in December, more than two years after the school joined the Coalition and with little in place except the Steering Committee and some attempts at change in a few classrooms, the larger issue of what being a Coalition school meant for Elliston was raised again and the Committee decided that a SWAS program would <i>not </i>be acceptable. The Committee's report ended by raising the larger concerns discussed at the meeting:<p><blockquote>What we don't know . . . is what being a coalition school could mean for us. What do we want it to mean? The Coalition Steering Committee feels that we as a staff and school community have to define what the coalition principles mean for our school and for us as teachers. It is the hope of the committee that this process can be an open one which does not preclude the possibility of rejecting some of the principles or even all of them.</blockquote>	Other events affected the discussion of the school's relationship to the Coalition as well. During the 1988-89 school year Elliston High School received an A+ Award for Excellence from the National Education Association -- based on an application that highlighted the work the school had undertaken through its Coalition membership. The award was announced while debate on Coalition membership was "heating up" again, and some of those opposed to Coalition membership viewed this award as an effort at rsum-building by the co-coordinators, not as an achievement in which the entire school should take pride . <p>	Also, as part of the debate about membership, several strongly worded memos that outlined key issues were circulated among the faculty through-out the 1988-89 school year, including a letter from CES chairman Ted Sizer to all of the member schools that encouraged schools to commit themselves to schoolwide implementation of Coalition philosophy: <p><blockquote>[I]t is virtually impossible to pursue one of the nine Common Principles without ultimately engaging with them all. . . . [I]mproving the work in conventional classrooms is a wonderful thing but insufficient for this particular Coalition's work. Our goal is more ambitious -- to effect a new, demonstrably higher level of educational quality by breaking out, where necessary, of existing constraining structures. (Sizer 1989)</blockquote>	The February (1989) faculty meeting at Elliston included a lengthy debate about Sizer's letter, particularly whether the school was required to implement all nine Common Principles to remain a Coalition member. <p>	At the end of March, in preparation for a faculty vote on continued Coalition membership, the Steering Committee raised four questions: <p><ol>	<li>	Does Elliston have to implement all nine principles in order to remain a member of the Coalition? <p>	<li>	What does each principle actually mean? What do we currently do with each principle? <p>	<li>	How do the principles apply to our [proposed] new mission statement? <p>	<li>	Should Elliston continue its affiliation with the national Coalition?</ol><p>	Numerous communications with the Coalition Central Staff requested clarification on the first point and inquired about the "boundaries" of local interpretation; for example, could individual principles be completely rewritten? Additionally, Coalition proponents indicated to the Coalition Staff that many faculty questioned whether there was a need for change at their school. One coordinator wrote: "Some teachers question the need for change. After all, we are doing very well as measured by standardized instruments and college placement. We often hear the question of 'Why fix what doesn't need fixing?'" In late April Sizer responded to the coordinator's letter with a ten-page letter that elaborated upon his January letter but still emphasized that all nine Common Principles were interrelated.<p>	In May, a faculty survey listing each of the nine Common Principles and the proposed Elliston interpretation was distributed. The survey portion asked faculty to indicate the extent of their agreement with the Steering Committee's interpretations, which were identical with the Coalition Principles only for universal goals, exhibitions of mastery, and values of unanxious expectations. There was an explicit redefinition of the principles concerning the comprehensive high school, student-as-worker, and teacher-as-generalist. The remaining principles (simple goals, personalization, and budget) were reworded, but not completely challenged. Generally, there was strong agreement with the Common Principles as rewritten. <p>	In the comment section of the survey, however, strong disagreements and criticisms were recorded, indicating that previous interpretive differences had not been erased by what seemed to be greater consensus about Committee's interpretation of the Common Principles. Some of the opposition's comments were:<p><blockquote>Less is not necessarily better;</blockquote><blockquote>We are losing our comprehensiveness when we drop courses and programs in the elective areas; and </blockquote><blockquote>I am opposed to Sizer's concept of teachers being generalists. </blockquote>Two other comments addressed wider issues: <p><blockquote>If we want to rewrite so many of these, why are we in the Coalition? and</blockquote><blockquote>What are the school's goals? </blockquote>	Finally, in June, 1989, the Elliston faculty voted 55 opposed to and 30 in favor of the statement "Elliston High School should continue its formal affiliation with the National Coalition of Essential Schools." The school requested permission from the Coalition for interested faculty to attend and participate in Coalition-sponsored activities. That summer a few teachers participated in Coalition workshops at Brown University. No further participation in Coalition activities has occurred.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="cp"><hr><center><h2>Comparative Perspective</h2></center><hr>Based on these case studies (and research at our other study schools), perhaps the most important point to be made is that there was no consensus at the schools that fundamental changes in school structure and/or teaching practices needed to occur. Instead, at each school a "vanguard" of interested faculty voluntarily embraced Coalition philosophy and saw themselves, and were viewed by the administration, as "harbingers of the future." Their noninvolved colleagues viewed them quite differently, as the recipients of preferential treatment. They called the Coalition core the "principal's favorites" and argued that they received all sorts of benefits, from fewer and better students, to more free periods, to more opportunities for travel and greater access to professional development funds. <p>	Conversely, the teachers and administrators involved with reform saw a need for the support Coalition faculty received and expected that their efforts would eventually benefit the entire school. Further, since faculty involvement often entailed volunteering free time, involved teachers dismissed the label of preferential treatment. <p>	Several changes occurred as a result of these developments within the schools. For one, new "we/they" distinctions emerged within the faculties. Moreover, equity issues continually arose that further reinforced these "we/they" distinctions -- such as when class size requirements of SWAS pilots were believed to increase other teachers' class loads. In all cases the perception of favored treatment and reactions to CES membership were linked to some teachers' opinions about the principal. For the principal's opponents, then, attacking the "favorites" or the program was viewed as an attack on the principal as well.<p>	Since there was no consensus about the need for change, Coalition schools and programs could not simply try "anything" they might have wished. Instead, the usual starting points for reform were aspects of the Common Principles that individual teachers (or small teams of teachers) could implement with little disruption to the school as a whole. For example, Coalition reform began in each case school with an emphasis on student-as-worker and personalization,5 and these changes were imple-mented without faculty consensus concerning their appropriateness as a schoolwide philosophy. (This was less true of the schedule changes at Barrett that affected the entire school, although there, too, the initial emphasis was on student-as-worker classroom activities.) Further, our study schools did not implement the Coalition principles that proved most contentious, such as: applying the aphorism "less is more" to their curriculum; integrating exhibitions (as defined as schoolwide assessment measures required for promotion or graduation) into their programs; having faculty function as "generalists" who teach in more than one discipline; or reducing their student:faculty ratios to 80-to-1, unless it was for certain faculty members only (e.g., SWAS faculty).<p>	Nevertheless, by defining the individual classroom as the arena within which to make changes and evaluate their success, reports of success by Coalition teachers have been impressive. Focusing on student-as-worker and personalization often revitalized teachers and demonstrated to them a potential for personal efficacy in the classroom that many felt had been lost. Over time, however, concentrating on these two principles focused the change process on the teacher-student-subject matter relationship and tended to ignore larger issues of schoolwide change, such as changing the schedule or the student-to-teacher ratio or restructuring schoolwide into houses. (Again, this was less true of Barrett where there was more schedule change, but less consensus about the value of student-as-worker pedagogy.) While the classroom was the locus of change most emphasized in early Coalition rhetoric, because of the fundamental interconnectedness of so many aspects of school life, a lack of attention to schoolwide issues has even impeded the scope of change possible in individual classrooms.<p>	The divisions created within schools as a result of Coalition membership also restricted communication among the faculty -- a consequence of the perceived criticisms of existing practices, the sense that the vanguard received preferential treatment, and the tensions, power struggles, and personal misgivings these feelings generated. In turn, noninvolved faculty rarely developed a clear sense of the reform effort, what changes were being enacted, or what their effects had been on students, teachers, or the institution as a whole -- beyond how certain changes might directly affect their own situations. <p>	Finally, Coalition supporters have been politically naive in their use of power, in their negotiations with their less interested colleagues, and in their expectations about what school change would require. For the Coalition as a whole, there was, at first, naivet about the degree to which school reform could be effected solely by focusing on academic concerns, specifically, the triangle of learning. Paralleling this trend, Coalition supporters in our study schools focused on the triangle as well -- for instance, concentrating on program structure, curriculum, and their pedagogy -- while giving limited attention to political concerns and the consequences of exerting influence within the school. <p>	Moreover, since the tensions that emerged within faculties were largely unanticipated, most pro-Coalition faculty members were unprepared to deal with resistance when it arose. On top of the other difficulties these teachers faced -- developing curriculum, organizing their schedules, and generally dealing with the uncertainties associated with something new and ambitious -- political opposition at the school site was an unpleasant surprise that few faculty had the time or energy or appropriate forum to resolve. <p>	The naivet of Coalition supporters was especially apparent in their tendency to define those not currently involved with or uninterested in their reform efforts as potential supporters, instead of viewing them as equally liable to oppose their efforts. Yet, as some of those initially unconcerned about these reform efforts, or even supportive of the ideas <i>in theory</i>, realized the ramifications of these changes <i>in practice</i>, what seemed like a good idea or, at worst, a harmless experiment became the basis for controversy and contention. <p>	In addition, in order to exert counter-influence to change efforts, those opposed did not need a consistent theoretical or political basis. All the opposition required was to be upset with some aspect of the changes they were experiencing. Given that the Coalition advocates changing multiple aspects of school life, these reforms held the potential for considerable opposition to arise. And opposition did emerge, over and over again in the same school, sometimes for the same reasons, sometimes in modified arguments or assertions. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="fr"><hr><center><h2>Final Remarks</h2></center><hr>In closing we would like to make four general remarks about school change. First, it might be productive to ask two distinct questions about change before beginning: <p><blockquote>Is change necessary? </blockquote><blockquote>If it is, are the proposed changes appropriate? </blockquote>	Second, from the discussions about change and the need for change at our schools, it became apparent to us that a desire to promote change is not value-neutral. Whether or not the rhetoric of an organization (like the Coalition or a school) suggests that everyone can benefit from school reform, efforts to create change implicitly criticize the status quo and create a sense that there are winners and losers. Being an advocate for school change precludes approaching the topic neutrally: regardless of intention, advocates are vested in viewing change as "improvement" and they are perceived as judgmental both by those who support change and those opposed. <p>	Third, the divisiveness and conflicts that arose in our study schools may have been inherent to the change process. People responded differently -- resistantly, embracingly, obliviously -- to a call for change, thereby creating a more contentious atmosphere at the school than previously existed. If the expectation is that change or specific changes will become part of the life of the whole school, eventually contentious issues will have to be addressed. In the cases we discussed, political opposition threatened the vanguard in part because it was unexpected and they were not prepared to deal with it. Because restructuring efforts cannot simply focus on philosophical, pedagogical or even struc-tural concerns, political consciousness raising may need to be part of the preparation for change. Those interested in restructuring schools will need to juggle the structural concerns reforms raise with philosophical and pedagogical issues in ways that are respectful of the group dynamics of the workplace and savvy about the political and personal tensions that change can both uncover and create. As part of this political socialization, it would seem reasonable to warn potential change agents that what is considered "opposition" at a school may vary: opposition can potentially include anyone not actively involved in the change effort, not just the outright hostile. <p>	Fourth, teachers may want to consider how to make their school's philosophy, the proposed changes, and the change process the objects of regular reflection by the entire faculty. As change occurs, a school's philosophy may become contested. It might be useful, therefore, to recognize that <i>change </i>and <i>philosophy </i>are terms continually negotiated (more or less actively) among the factions and individuals within a school. This view might encourage more frequent, structured conversations about contentious issues that could help reveal and resolve some of the tensions, productive or otherwise, before they threaten an entire reform effort.<p>	Our work may appear to denigrate efforts at change that are occurring in Coalition schools. This is not our intent. Our motivation in preparing this article is simple and straight-forward: schoolwide reform as advocated by the Coalition, and more generally, is going to be extremely difficult to accomplish. It will be time- and labor-intensive and will require rethinking and relearning by all participants. It will, as David Tyack said, mean that if teachers "are really to be free to experiment, they may also fail, as do doctors or politicians" (1990: 187). For, as Philip Schlechty (1989) observed, these reform efforts are on "the cutting edge of ignorance," implying that change of the scope and nature presently being undertaken has no historical precedent. To deny this is to believe that there are quick fixes or miracle cures. Structural constraints and power issues are realities in all institutions (Sarason 1990). For current reform efforts to avoid ending up "on the margins of the schools" (Cohen 1988:242) like so many other educational innovations, those wishing to make change more central to their school may benefit from considering these points about whether there is a consensus about the desirability of change, about the political nature of change, and about the fundamental interconnectedness of all aspects of school life <i>before </i>beginning change and <i>throughout </i>the change process. <p><hr><center><h2>Notes and References</h2></center><hr><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><h3>Notes</h3><p><ol><li> See, for example, Holt 1964, Kohl 1967, Kozol 1967, National Commission on Excellence in Education 1983, Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on Federal Elementary and Secondary Education Policy 1983, and Task Force on Education for Economic Growth 1983.<p><li> A Study of High Schools generated three books: <i>Horace's Compromise  </i>by Sizer (1985), <i>The Shopping Mall High School </i>by Arthur Powell et al.

The following individuals made helpful comments on earlier drafts of this working paper: Emily Mathis, Martha Gardner, Ingrid Liiv, Sarah Uhl, Elaine D. Gustafson, Amy Gerstein, and Phil Stone. The authors would like to thank the teachers and administrators at our eight study schools for their openness to our presence and their careful attention to multiple drafts of our work; agreements designed to protect the individuals' and schools' identities preclude our mentioning any of them by name. We could not have done our work without their cooperation and participation; we hope that our findings are of some use to them. We realize it would not be difficult to identify the study schools, but ask that readers respect their wish for anonymity as we have. Finally, we thank the members of the Coalition Central Staff and, particularly, Ted Sizer for their willingness to allow a long-term study of the Coalition to occur.<p><a name="contents"><hr><h2> Table of Contents:</h2><p><ul><li><a href="#intr">Introduction</a>	<ul>	<li><a href="#sep">School Ethnography Project</a>	</ul><li><a href="#ffts">Findings from the School Ethnography Project Study</a>	<ul>	<li><a href="#scot">Seven Characteristics of the Schools that Continue to Restructure</a>	<li><a href="#spte">Seven Problems that Emerged in Most of the Schools</a>	<li><a href="#srtc">Student Responses to Coalition Reforms</a>	<li><a href="#sttr">Skills that Teachers Requested to Help Deepen Their Reform Work</a>	<li><a href="#summ">Summary</a>	</ul><li><a href="#note">Notes</a><li><a href="#refe">References</a></ul><p><a name="intr"><hr><center><h2>Introduction</h2></center><hr><blockquote>[T]here is not a specific blueprint here for a top-to-bottom restructuring of the system. That's been tried and is being tried with the result being a high degree of failure. In any case, such a blueprint or model would violate the first of the imperatives: giving room to teachers and students to work and learn in their own way. - Ted Sizer, <i>Horace's Compromise </i>(1985a)</blockquote><p>In this article we take a micro- look at school reform in the United States by examining one school reform movement, the Coalition of Essential Schools (CES). While "the Coalition" represents but one of many reform efforts in the United States, we feel it offers a productive perspective for viewing school reform more generally. For instance, CES has been involved with school change since 1984, when the first member schools joined. Some Essential schools (as Coalition member schools are called), then, have been experimenting with Coalition-based reform for more than eight years. Essential schools represent a cross section of American education -- including public, private, parochial, urban, suburban, and rural schools. <p>	In addition, as with school reform more generally, the Coalition's reform platform has evolved over time and now incorporates many aspects of reform common to other movements, particularly its emphasis on schoolwide restructuring. Some Coalition members, for instance, have restructured their schools into teams of students and teachers; others have reorganized their schedules to provide extended blocks of time. School-site management and faculty-initiated professional development also have been increasingly advocated. In terms of pedagogy and curriculum, some Essential schools have experimented with alternative assessment methods and others have begun to redesign their curricula in terms of "essential questions," all with the goal of making students more active learners.1 <p>	Mirroring developments in the larger arena of education reform, Coalition efforts have not been unequivocally successful. The Coalition has encountered problems and resistance in various forms. For example, findings suggest that Essential schools are having difficulties moving their ideas from the realm of discussion and limited experimentation in individual classrooms or in pilot projects to the arena of schoolwide change (Muncey and McQuillan 1990, 1993; McQuillan and Muncey 1991). Although problems exist, there are reasons for optimism as well. <p>	In Appendix A, we review some specific dimensions of this reform effort, including a historical overview of the Coalition, as well as a look at its expanding membership, collaborative partnerships, and the organizational restructuring that has taken place. <p>	Following a brief description of the School Ethnography Project's study of the Coalition, we will look at some findings derived from our work.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sep"><h3>School Ethnography Project</h3>In 1986 the School Ethnography Project began a four-year ethnographic study of the Coalition's Central Staff, a sample of eight of the twelve charter schools, and the professional development activities offered by the Central Staff for member (and potential member) schools. In our research we did not seek to evaluate the Coalition of Essential Schools; rather, we sought to document broadly what occurred as a consequence of the Coalition's reform efforts.2  <p>	Most of our research was conducted in the eight study-site schools and focused on two broad questions about the Common Principles: How are the Common Principles interpreted by individual schools? And, how do those involved in Essential schools (teachers, administrators, and students) implement the principles as they are developed in each setting? <p>	Specifically, our research entailed observing classes, after-school activities, planning meetings, and other school-based activities. We interviewed students, teachers, and administrators about their work, about proposed or implemented changes, and about their future plans. We conducted a survey of 1,500 students in eleven Essential schools and collected related data about the schools, such as newspaper articles, yearbooks and other school publications, faculty- and student-authored work, and materials stored in Coalition archives about individual schools. Although our research focused primarily on school sites, we also attended Coalition staff meetings, conferences, and workshops, interviewed Central Staff members, and generally stayed abreast of developments within the Central Staff. We concluded our research in June 1990.<p>	Of our eight study schools, six were public high schools, one was a private high school, and one was a newly created secondary school in a district of choice. All were located in eastern states. Three of the public schools were urban schools with enrollments of approximately 1,000 students each -- two having largely minority populations. Two schools were suburban high schools with substantial per-pupil expenditures and reputations as "excellent" schools; one enrolled 250 students and the other nearly 1,000. One school was a small rural school. The private school, too, was small, with about 200 students. <p>	Changing demographics were at issue in most of our study schools. For example, at one school the student population fell by as much as 30 percent over the course of our research. Prior to joining the Coalition, each school varied in its commitment to change. Only two of the eight schools held faculty referenda on Coalition membership before joining. The other six schools joined primarily because of the initiative of the principal or superintendent.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="ffts"><hr><center><h2>Findings from the School Ethnography Project Study</h2></center><hr>In this section we specifically discuss: 1) the characteristics of those schools which, after six years of Coalition membership, continue to pursue a reform agenda; 2) some common problems that emerged at many of our study sites; 3) the variety of student responses to Coalition-based reforms we observed; and 4) some skills that have become important at schools that are restructuring traditional practices.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="scot"><h3>Seven Characteristics of the Schoolsthat Continue to Restructure</h3>Of our eight study schools, three continue to push an active Coalition reform agenda. One is a comprehensive urban school in a city where such schools traditionally have had the "lowest attendance, worst [test] scores, and highest dropout rates."3 The second is located in a poor, rural district that had had a relatively high dropout rate and had sent few students to college prior to the arrival of its new principal and its association with the Coalition. The third is a new school in a district of choice in a large urban center with some of the worst school conditions, highest dropout rates, and generally low academic performance in the country (Kozol 1991). These three schools share seven characteristics in terms of their Coalition-related reform efforts:<p><h4>1. Supportive Administrators</h4>	The principals are vocally supportive of their restructuring efforts and are respected by most faculty members. While at other schools faculty often resisted efforts to implement change solely on the basis of their opposition to the principal and his or her close association with this effort, these principals have been able to persuade faculty to participate in the reforms. In addition, they have been at their schools throughout the period of restructuring. Our other five study schools have experienced at least some administrative turnover --of either the principal, assistant principals, and/or the school's Coalition coordinator. <p><h4>2. Absence of Special Interests</h4>	There were no powerful, entrenched interests in place at these schools prior to the reform. These schools did not have magnet programs, extensive advanced placement offerings, a powerful union presence, or other special interests that might have felt threatened by and/or resisted efforts to restructure. <p><h4>3. No Prior Reputation  for Excellence</h4>	Somewhat related to the preceding characteristic, none of these three schools had a reputation for academic excellence. Two of the schools had substantial at-risk populations, relatively high dropout rates, and few students who went on to college. The third school, since it was new and building grade-by-grade, had no prior reputation. <p><h4>4. Outside Support and Encouragement</h4>	These three schools also received considerable attention from the Coalition. The Central Staff visited them more than most member schools -- possibly because these schools reported regularly on their experimental efforts and made specific requests for assistance from the Central Staff. Because the Coalition Central Staff perceived these schools to be doing some of the more ambitious reform work, they were often "showcased" in Coalition symposia, workshops, and public relations efforts. Yet, in providing support to these schools, the Central Staff did not direct the schools' work; rather, they tended to do whatever they could to support the schools' self-initiated efforts, a key aspect of their respect for local autonomy and decision making. As a result of the interaction between the Central Staff and these schools, the teachers generally viewed Central Staff members positively, as having something to offer them, and as encouraging of their efforts. <p><h4>5. Faculty-run Professional Development</h4>	These three schools sponsored and ran their own professional development activities, which built on aspects of Coalition philosophy. These activities included half-day, in-service workshops; faculty retreats; and extended summer workshops. Coalition Central Staff members commonly contributed their expertise to staffing these efforts.<p><h4>6. A Cohesive Faculty</h4>	Principals at these three schools have taken advantage of faculty turnover and selective loss of staff due to declining enrollments to hire and retain those faculty members who expressed interest in pursuing reform goals. They also assisted less interested faculty in finding positions elsewhere. <p><h4>7. Support for Teachers</h4>	Each of the three schools took various steps to support the efforts of teachers involved in their restructuring efforts. These included creating common planning time, so that those involved in the reform efforts could meet jointly, and securing funds so that participants could attend Coalition-sponsored workshops. <p>	Abstracting from these common characteristics, two points are worth noting: First, school reform at these three sites was clearly multidimensional and provided many different opportunities for school personnel to become involved.4 In addition, there were both external (e.g., Central Staff expertise) and internal (e.g., planning time, professional development) supports for people's efforts at change. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="spte"><h3>Seven Problems that Emergedin Most of the Schools</h3>While all of our study-site schools defined and interpreted the Common Principles in different ways and went about their efforts to implement change differently, at seven of our eight schools -- including two of the schools discussed above -- many similar problems emerged. We summarize seven of the most common problems as follows: <p><ol><li><h4> Lack of Consensus on Change</h4>	Perhaps the most widespread "problem" (at least from the perspective that stresses a need for change) was that in each of these seven schools there was no consensus that fundamental changes in school structure and/or teaching practices needed to occur. Rather, if there was any consensus among faculty at these schools regarding the need for change, it was that the larger society needed to change, since present social conditions (e.g., single-parent families, drug abuse, disrespect for authority by students) made it difficult for successful teaching to occur.<p><li><h4> Philosophical Differences</h4>	The changes that occurred or were considered when a school joined Coalition forced the issue of what constituted the school's philosophy. Making a school's philosophy problematic for its staff in this way tended to disrupt the fragile (and usually unspoken and unquestioned) assumption that shared purposes, values, and beliefs underlay the everyday world of the school. It also revealed differences that various faculty had concerning their jobs, the school's mission, and the best ways to educate students. <p><li><h4> Failure to Expand Schoolwide</h4>	While reports of success by individual teachers were often impressive, few schools ever attempted the more schoolwide reforms that the Coalition envisions. In each school, reform efforts began with aspects of the Common Principles that individual teachers (or small teams of teachers) could implement with little disruption to the daily business of school and without faculty consensus regarding their appropriateness or representativeness as a schoolwide philosophy -- for example, student-as-worker and personalization (see Appendix B). <p><li><h4> Faculty Divisivemess</h4>	At most schools, it was only a small core of faculty who voluntarily embraced Coalition philosophy and became active in their school's reform efforts. While they often saw themselves, and were seen by the administration, as "harbingers of the future," faculty not involved in Coalition reforms often saw them as receiving preferential treatment within the school. Consequently, rather than providing examples or role models, these persons often divided the faculty, and any signs of their success were dismissed as the result of these alleged "favored" conditions. <p><li><h4> Lack of Political Astuteness</h4>	Most Coalition teachers focused their efforts on academic aspects of their reform efforts and paid little attention to their use of power within the school or the consequences of reform-related actions for their less reform-interested colleagues. While at times this was an effective short-term strategy, political issues eventually surfaced. When those initially not concerned about or uninvolved in Coalition reforms realized the ramifications of Coalition-based changes in practice, what seemed like a good idea or, at worst, a harmless experiment, became the basis for substantial political controversy and contentiousness for which Coalition faculty were unprepared. <p><li><h4> Limited Communication</h4>	The divisions created within schools as a result of the schools' reform efforts restricted communication among the faculty. This, in turn, often meant that the opposition that emerged at our study schools was based on hearsay as well as on actual developments. <p><li><h4> No Continuing Dialogue about Change</h4>	Schools assumed that once a faculty "accepted" a reform program, there was little need to reflect on this decision further. In effect, planning for change became defined as part of the start-up for change rather than as part of an <i>ongoing process </i>of change. While many schools created time for their faculties to discuss the implications of Coalition membership <i>before </i>joining, once they joined there was much less facultywide discussion about restructuring -- unless the program became a topic of serious political contention within the school.5</ol><p>	As a result of these and other site-specific problems (union issues, declining enrollments, and administrative turnover), six years after it began its Coalition work, one of our study school's school-within-a-school program is "on hold" with no plans to expand; three schools are "rethinking" the nature of their commitment to the Coalition (or to restructuring in general); and one school has decided to leave the Coalition and has no plans to continue restructuring, although it continues to discuss school-change issues. <p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="srtc"><h3>Students' Responses to Coalition Reforms </h3>Students have not been passive recipients of Coalition reform efforts at their schools. We have noted a wide range of student responses to the changes. In our study schools, students were often enthusiastic about the changes they experienced. In particular, students generally approved of and found helpful one popular curricular innovation in Essential schools -- that of making interdisciplinary connections between traditionally distinct fields.6 Commenting on her English/history course, one junior discussed how this interdisciplinary offering made both subjects more accessible to her class:<p><blockquote>[W]hen they say, "Take your <i>Scarlet Letter </i>out," you know they're going to talk about English, and when they say, "Take out your American history book," you know it's history. But it's so interrelated that it's really just one thing. It's just like the Puritans are in history, the Puritans are in our English books. . . . It's also easier to understand because English helps you with the history and the history helps you with the English, because the history tells you how people were and whole outlines. But then the English gives you examples. You feel what the people felt. </blockquote><p>	Students did not, of course, enthusiastically endorse and accept all of the changes they experienced. We saw numerous instances of student resistance (both active and passive) in Essential school classrooms. For example, students might not complete work on time. They could delay making up work and argue that they did not understand a teacher's new expectations. When facing new and different projects and standards (often instituted by school-within-a-school teams), students raised two common objections: "They don't have to do this in the other [non-Coalition] history [science, etc.] classes" and "Why should I not pass if I have a 70, and 70 is passing in the rest of the school?" <p>	Occasionally, students expressed distrust about the changed relationships they experienced or new programs their schools implemented. Some were skeptical, distrustful, or outright rejecting of efforts to empower them, although such efforts as creating student-faculty legislatures or small advisory group programs were designed to provide them with more personalized contact with their teachers. At times, students were quite cynical about why a new opportunity was provided. One student expressed his lack of faith in a new governance initiative this way: "I think they [teachers and administrators] wanted to have it so at meetings with other high schools they could say, 'Well in [our meetings] we have parliamentary procedure and it's really working well, and the students get everything done that they want.'" If programs proved trustworthy (over long periods of time), student attitudes usually grew more favorable. <p>	A final response that we noted, primarily in nonsuburban schools, was that of raised academic expectations on the part of the students. Low-income (often minority) students repeatedly voiced the (new) expectation that they would attend a four-year college. We attribute this expectation in large part to the individualized attention that students in Essential school programs commonly receive. At these schools, teachers presented college as a real possibility. They reinforced their expectations by making field trips to various colleges, attending college fairs, and encouraging students to take SATs. As students from the first Essential school classes at these schools have graduated, this expectation has, to a large extent, been borne out as their college attendance rates have increased markedly. It remains to be seen whether these students will complete college; nevertheless, the college attendance rates of the early graduating classes from our urban, often "disadvantaged," student populations have been impressive.<p>	The types of changes that Coalition teachers made in their classrooms were designed to create activities to promote active student learning and increasingly to personalize students' experiences at schools. As we noted above, faculty often reported substantial satisfaction with these endeavors and felt revitalized as a result of students' responses and the quality of the classroom learning they felt was taking place. <p>	Students usually voiced awareness of these two goals, whether they were supportive of or resistant to efforts to change their classroom learning environment. For the most part they were appreciative of any efforts made to increase the personal interaction they had with teachers, to encourage them to pursue their own interests in their course work, and to assist them in the college application process. For students in the non-suburban schools, this increased personalization in Essential school classes was in marked contrast to, for example, other classes with forty-five or more students, and guidance counselors whom the students saw only when they transferred from one school to another.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="sttr"><h3>Skills That Teachers Requestedto Help Deepen Their Reform Work</h3>From its inception, those involved with Coalition reform have acknowledged that, to take strong root in schools, reforms would have to effect changes in both beliefs and actions. Although it would seem that the combination of action and belief would be sufficient to bring about real reforms at schools, we have much evidence that suggests a third necessary component: skills.7 That is, one may philosophically support the intention of a reform effort (belief) and may work in a school undertaking activities to achieve these ideals (action), but, lacking appropriate skills to realize the desired end, one's efforts may prove not only ineffective but also disillusioning. <p>	The three schools that continue to change have incorporated action, belief, and skills into their reform planning and work. They have created structures to support their efforts. They have discussed and defined the philosophical and pedagogical assumptions that undergird their actions. Also, they have created opportunities, often in conjunction with the Coalition, to help faculty and administrators develop the skills needed to implement Coalition philosophy and realize their desired outcomes. These include not only skills to improve classroom pedagogy, but also ways to improve collaboration with colleagues, make parental interactions more productive, and cope with teachers' expanded roles as student advisors. <p>	Other skills of concern to Essential school teachers include: team teaching; developing shared leadership (management and administrative techniques); interdisciplinary planning; developing curricula driven by essential questions; devising appropriate performance-based assessments; and creating long-term goals and a vision for their schools. As teachers and administrators have identified skills, the Coalition's Central Staff and the individual school sites have sought to develop appropriate professional development activities to meet these needs.<p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="summ"><h3>Summary</h3>The Coalition of Essential Schools encourages schools to seriously rethink the realities of their day-to-day operation and the vision of education that underlies their current functioning. Throughout its eight years of rapid expansion -- both of Central Staff and member schools -- the Coalition has encouraged schools to incorporate more actors into their discussions about and experiments with change; it has created new professional development activities to address concerns that affiliated schools have encountered; and it has taken an increasingly active role in the national discourse about educational reform. <p><p>	The struggles of the schools we studied are not atypical of other Coalition member schools, nor are they atypical of other schools and organizations attempting to introduce changes into entrenched, static systems. The crucial lesson that derives from these first eight years of Coalition reform efforts is that the task of bringing about genuine change in schools is an enormous one, one which involves parents and people at all levels of the educational system. Cautious action and continual reflection are interconnected elements of the change process advocated by the Coalition. And, as Sizer has maintained from the start, meaningful reform will not happen quickly:<p><blockquote>Experiments must be ambitious and long range; schools are complicated places, and attitudes -- those of teachers, students, and others -- must change as well as [must] the structures of the schools in which they work. This takes time . . . (Sizer 1986)</blockquote><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><a name="note"><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></center><hr><ol><p><li> Works by Wiggins -- particularly 1987 and 1989, but also 1991 -- discuss aspects of essential questions, alternative assessment, and student-as-worker pedagogy.<p><li> We acknowledge that there is much concern regarding the influence of CES reforms on student performance. However, as anthropologists studying change broadly, our research focus was not on educational evaluation. We therefore did not attempt to measure how these reforms affected student academic performance.<p><li> As cited in the report of one of the supporting foundations (1988).<p><li> Cusick (1991) for instance, argues that most effective efforts at school change have been systematic and multidimensional.<p><li> These points are explored in more detail in Muncey and McQuillan (1993).<p><li> Often these connections were made between English and history. Sometimes math and science were combined and, more rarely, other combinations such as science and history or math and English were undertaken. <p><li> The emphasis on the need to develop skills in the persons who will be implementing changes has been noticed by other researchers studying change efforts.  For example, Dryfoos (1990), surveying programs for at-risk students, names "staff training" as one of the key points in determining whether a program is successful in attaining its aims or not (1990:241). She writes:<blockquote>The importance of training, highlighted by many of the models, gets short shrift in experts' recommendations. Although most recommendations call for committed and sensitive teachers, social workers, community aides, and other staff and volunteers, little attention is paid to giving them the necessary orientation, skills, and super-vision to activate their commitment.

Clark and Robert L. Hampel<p>The progress of change in five public Essential high schools between 1991 and 1994 was documented by CES research teams working in collaboration with the schools' faculty.  Drawing on the faculties' responses and their own observations, the research teams explore three main themes: how the nine Common Principles are put into practice; how whole-school change occurs; and what factors affect the momentum of change.<p><h4>The "Lincoln" Study:</h4>Robert L. Hampel with Loraine Hong, Neill Wenger and Laura Maxwell<p>"Lincoln High School" is a mid-size, minority-majority suburban high school in a south-central state.  Forty percent of Lincoln's students come from low-income families.  Since joining the Coalition in 1988, Lincoln has implemented several major changes, including teaming, site-based decision making, and authentic assessments.<p><ul><li><b><a href="sc/lincoln1.htm">Lincoln No. 1: The Limits of Caring, the Rigors of Change</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/lincoln2.htm">Lincoln No. 2: Teaming: Working Together for Change</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/lincoln3.htm">Lincoln No. 3: A Student's-eye View of School Change</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/lincoln4.htm">Lincoln No. 4: Priorities and Possibilities: Choices for Change</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/lincoln5.htm">Lincoln No. 5: Rewriting the Roles</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/lincoln6.htm">Lincoln No. 6: Three Views of Lincoln</a></b><p></ul><p><h4>The "Crossroads" Study:</h4>Richard W. Clark with Janey Miller and Vicky Murray<p>"Crossroads High School" is a mid-size school in a multi-ethnic community on the outskirts of a Southwestern city.  In addition to its traditional features, Crossroads has an interdisciplinary, cross-grade program and a governing council in which faculty, students, parents, and administrators share decision making.  Crossroads joined the Coalition in 1991.<p><ul><li><b><a href="sc/cross1.htm">Crossroads No. 1: Challenges and Incongruities</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/cross2.htm">Crossroads No. 2: Consensus-building: Progress and Problems</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/cross3.htm">Crossroads No. 3: A Context for Change</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/cross4.htm">Crossroads No. 4: Possibilities and Realities: Facing the Obstacles to Change</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/cross5.htm">Crossroads No. 5: Some Things Change, Some Things Don't</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/cross6.htm">Crossroads No. 6: Still At The Crossroads</a></b><p></ul><p><h4>The "Oak Hill" Study:</h4>Patricia A. Wasley with Barbara Powell and Donna Hughes<p>"Oak Hill High School" is the pseudonym for a suburban school in the Northeast with a primarily white, college-bound population.  A traditional high school with a history of openness to innovation, Oak Hill joined the Coalition in the 1989-90 school year.<p><ul><li><b><a href="sc/oh1.htm">Oak Hill No. 1: Poised for Change</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/oh2.htm">Oak Hill No. 2: Principles and Practice</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/oh2a.htm">Oak Hill No. 2a: Interpreting the Nine Common Principles</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/oh3.htm">Oak Hill No. 3: A Gathering Momentum: Change and Transition</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/oh4.htm">Oak Hill No. 4: Toward a Reflexive Learning Community</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/oh5.htm">Oak Hill No. 5: Ideals and Realities</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/oh6.htm">Oak Hill No. 6: Looking Back, Looking Ahead</a></b><p></ul><p><h3>The Urban School Studies:</h3>Richard W. Clark, Janet Miller, Neill Wenger and Barara S. Powell<p>Studies of two of the high schools, in a large Eastern city, reveal the particular challenges of attempting change within the inner city.  Underlining the connection between what happens in schools and their larger context, these studies describe districtwide restructuring efforts, as well as school-based initiatives.<p><h4>The "Marshall" Study:</h4>"Marshall High School" enrolls more than 2,000 students from all parts of the city.<ul><li><b><a href="sc/marshal1.htm">Marshall No. 1: On the Road to Renewal</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/marshal2.htm">Marshall No. 2: Thriving in the Midst of Chaos</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/marshal3.htm">Marshall No. 3: Finding Common Vision</a></b><p></ul><p><h4>The "Forest Park" Study:</h4>"Forest Park High School" enrolls 1,000 ninth- through twelfth-graders from a neighborhood filled with the signs of urban decay.<ul><li><b><a href="sc/fp1.htm">Forest Park No. 1: Revitalization in an Urban Setting</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/fp2.htm">Forest Park No. 2: Many Paths to Reform</a></b><p><li><b><a href="sc/fp3.htm">Forest Park No. 3: "Clean, Cool, and Calm": A Haven in the Inner City</a></b><p></ul><p><a href="#contents">[Return to Table of Contents]</a><p><p><a name="3"><hr><h2>Research papers on the School Ethnography Proejct:</h2><hr>Donna Muncey and Patrick McQuillan<p>This six-year, independently funded project, begun in 1986, documents the consequences of reform efforts in eight "charter" Essential Schools.

McCarthy if you have questions)</center><p>At last week's meeting we voted to continue the block for this year. Now we need to decide about next year. The curriculum committee has found that there are two big issues which make it hard for us to recommend a particular plan for the schedule for next year: (1) what to do about the period 1 and 7 schedule and (2) what to do about advisory. Concerning the period 1 and 7 schedule, the sports/PE classes seem to be the most frequently mentioned reason for needing daily meetings of these periods. However, there are other arguments. Concerning advisory, we are not sure whether the experiences to date indicate we should continue the program next year. Nor can we tell, if we do, what the frequency of meeting or the length of each advisory session should be. We need to talk about this in depth during our planning period meetings on March 7, 8 and 9. During the March 3 meeting we hope to hear different points of view that will help all of us be aware of the issues as we have these period discussions. Everyone should be aware that we hope to have a vote on the block schedule for 1994-95 during our faculty meeting on March 17. The specific motion on which we will vote will be on the agenda which will be issued on March 14 for that meeting.<p><p><center><h3>Continuation of Faculty Meetings</h3>(Contact A. Prince or M. B. Bryan if you have questions)</center><p>Since January, 1994 our entire faculty has met each Thursday from 3:30 to 4:30. We had hoped to be able to conduct these meetings during early dismissals on Friday. However, we will have to wait until transportation can coordinate our dismissal with ending times for other schools. Meanwhile we believe the meetings should continue for the rest of the year so we can take care of important unfinished business. The motion on this week's agenda has been developed by the administration committee.<p><p><hr><a href="cross6.htm">Return to Crossroads No. 6</a><br><a href="../list.htm#2">Return to Index of School Change Publications</a><p></body></html>

Some of the resulting proposals incorporate aspects of the British model. For example, the proposal advanced by the National Center for Education and the Economy includes a place for "calibration" (or "moderation," as it is called in the British scheme). Similarly, the proposal advanced by the National Goals Panel of the National Governors Association calls for curric-ulum frameworks with the opportunity for local interpretation. I experienced the new British system during a year spent teaching in England. <p>        I offer the following observations and insights in the hope that they will add to the national debate over the desirability of similar reforms for American schools.<p>        During the 1988-89 academic year, I participated in a Fulbright teacher exchange in the United Kingdom. My British comprehensive school (a public school, in the American sense) was in a small town in rural Gloucestershire and could not have been more different from Newton South High School, where I have taught history and social studies for the past nineteen years. Newton is a Boston suburb famous for its commitment to quality education, while England's West Country is known to have a rather backward attitude toward education.<p>        The British education system was in the midst of major reforms in 1988. My British colleagues and I were caught up in the changeover wrought by the Education Act, which mandated a new national curriculum as well as new methods of assessment and evaluation for every state-supported school in England and Wales.<p><b>THE BASIS OF REFORM</b><p>Under the old assessment system, British schools used no grades as we know them, but sent home reports evaluating students' work. My school, for example, sent them to parents once a year (twice for eleven-year-olds who were new to the school). These reports contained a collection of very brief, qualitative statements from each teacher about the student's progress and a simple trifurcated evaluation, placing the student in the high, middle, or low achievement sector of the class. Very strict quotas applied here, with 25 percent being assigned to the high, 25 percent to the low, and the remaining 50 percent to the middle group. This evaluation was completely subjective on the part of the teacher, based on classwork and homework, and its only reference point was the other students in the class (not the entire grade-level). If students did poorly they were not retained, but went on with their classmates until old enough to leave school at age sixteen; such students were (and still are) called "school-leavers."<p>        British schools gave no diplomas or other certificates of attendance. Instead, students took one or two "public examinations." At sixteen, students would "sit" the ordinary level (O-level) exam, after which they could leave school, which approximately 80 percent of them chose to do. If they chose to stay on, they could, at age eighteen, take the advanced (A-level) exam. Acceptance at British universities was dependent on how many O-level and A-level "passes" one had. Most universities required two or three A-levels, but more selective ones demanded not merely passes, but high scores. For example, it would not be unusual for an Oxford college to demand two "A"s and a "B" or better on the A-levels.<p>        This traditional system was roundly criticized in many sectors of society for stressing recall rather than the application of knowledge. Even conservatives accused it of catering to the profes-sional sector of the economy and ignoring the industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, the Conservative government introduced the first stage of a series of educational reforms in the autumn of 1986. As a package, these reforms were referred to as the National Curriculum.<p>        This National Curriculum mandated that British students take (besides religious education) classes in the following ten areas: English, mathematics, science, technology, history, geography, art, music, physical education, and a modern foreign language. The first three subjects are "core subjects," while the others are "foun-dation subjects." In addition, a new assessment system replaced the old reports, and a new exam supplanted the O-level: the General Certificate of Secondary Education, or GCSE.<p>        Instead of the traditional high, medium, and low designations used on the old reports, a system of "profiling" was phased in. At the national level, various "assessment objectives" were defined by the Education Ministry. Then each department within a school drew up lists of specific skills for assessment, a sort of hierarchy of student under-standing and achievement for each of the nationally determined objectives. Huge amounts of teacher time went into the development of each department's profile. As students "attained" the particular level of understanding, as shown by homework and work in class, the appropriate box was checked by the teacher with the date on which this performance was demonstrated. For example, on my department's profile under the category "Using Information," there was the following range of achievement levels with a space for check-off and date:<p>        Date<p><ul>                <li>can collect basic information                <li>can extract and use simple, relevant information                         to create a description                <li>can extract and use relevant information to                         construct a simple explanation                <li> can select and use relevant information                         thoroughly and accurately for a specified purpose.</ul><p>        This assessment system was called "formative" rather than "summative." Its purpose was to be diagnostic, and it was to be "criterion-referenced" rather than "norm-referenced," designed to avoid competition among students. However, since the entire National Curriculum was part of a highly charged political program, one must be cautious when hearing British evaluations of the reforms. Tories tend to inflate the system's successes, while the Opposition tends to criticize the reforms, sometimes unfairly and prematurely.<p>        The Thatcher government, much enthralled by things American during the Reagan years, actually billed the new reforms as taking British education closer than had been the case to the American model. Market forces and parent choice were to be primary components of the new system. Parents would chose their children's schools, and money would follow the pupil. Good schools would survive, so the planners argued, while poor schools would wither away. The new assessment system, both the profiles and the GCSE exam, would be skills-oriented rather than content oriented. They would represent, in the words of former education minister Kenneth Baker, a "can-do" system, testing children's competence rather than probing to find what they were not capable of doing. The stigma attached to failure would be removed by giving students grades that ranged from "A" to "G." In all cases, however, a certificate would be granted to students taking the exam. In my school, even teachers who were critical of various aspects of the new exam felt that it was generally an improvement over the elitism of the old O-level, which gave school leavers nothing.<p>        Part of the GCSE grade was determined by student's classwork. Course-work, as it was called, was evaluated by the student's own teachers. Since the British have a strong bias against multiple-choice tests and a great predilection for written responses, machine-graded course-work was not acceptable. The work had to be in essay form, and this presented problems: essay evaluation is highly labor intensive and difficult to standardize. Since the government did not wish to spend much money on this aspect of their program, they developed an ingenious way to get the task done cheaply. Departments within schools were asked to develop their own course-work assignment on their own time (after school in meetings that lasted until early evening). Several "inset" (release) days were given to get the project off the ground, but not enough to complete it. Course-work marks were phased in over several years, becoming a larger and larger part of the GCSE score as teachers learned how to use the new assessment criteria. Ultimately, they counted as much as one-third of the final exam result.<p>        Course-work was then submitted to centrally designated "moderator" teachers who judged its acceptability. Presumably, the Education Ministry had some basis for deciding which teachers understood the national objectives well enough to serve in this capacity. They were awarded a modest stipend for their services, though rank-and-file teachers were paid nothing. Along with each assignment, departments submitted evaluation criteria, or "mark schemes," that tailored the scoring of the specific assignment to the overall measurement of the national assessment criteria. This would show how the scoring of the particular assignment fit into the overall scheme of national assessment objectives. If, for example, four levels of understanding were delineated for a particular question and if ten points was possible as a high score, the following might be the mark scheme on a particular question testing the national assessment objective of dealing with historical evidence:<p><b>LEVEL 1: Comprehension of source</b> (1-2 points)<br>For example, student can extract plausible if only partly relevant information from source, or can extract specific related information from more than one source.<p><b>LEVEL 2: Simple interpretation and evaluation </b>(3-4 points)<br>For example, student can classify type of source, comment on nature and tone of information provided, or can comment on plausibility of source.<p><b>LEVEL 3: Supported interpretation/ evaluation of source</b> (5-7 points)<br>For example, student can evaluate source by general sense of the period, in terms of author's situation or purpose, or by process of cross-referencing; can use source as evidence, not as information.<p><b>LEVEL 4: Full appreciation of the nature of historical evidence </b>(8-10 points)<br>For example, student can recognize that accounts may vary because of the nature of the sources upon which they draw; can identify the relationship of the historian to the object of study; can recognize the nature of historical proof.<p>        Once the course-work with its mark scheme was approved by the moderator and given to students, it was evaluated by the individual teacher. Upon reading an essay, one was encouraged to annotate the work, commenting on where the thresholds for the various levels had been crossed. Another member of the department also read the essays. The department then sat down for an entire day to collectively moderate marks. We tried to iron out discrepancies, citing disagreements with annota-tions about the various levels achieved by the students and compared aspects of one student's essay against those of another, all the time keeping the mark scheme firmly in both hand and mind.<p>        After this arduous but worthwhile process, samples of student essays for each mark level were submitted to the moderator, who determined whether our marks were accurate, too high, or too low. I believe that the moderator had the power to ask for all the exams if necessary. He or she also had the power to add or subtract from all our scores or selected groups of them (e.g., "You were too hard on the low end: add one point each to all scores below six"). Nonetheless, our course-work marks stood as we had submitted them, causing me to wonder how frequently if at all, they were changed in other schools. Being unfamiliar with the system, we tended to be rather tentative and conservative in terms of inflating our students' scores too much. Because we all wished to avoid intervention by the moderator, my department marked the work scrupulously and earnestly.<p>        It is possible that in time, as teachers become more familiar with the system, more games-manship will develop in marking, especially if GCSE scores are tied to evaluations of teacher effective-ness. Still, I found the effort of collegially determining both appropriate level-of-under-standing performances and the degree of student under-standing to be highly worthwhile exercises. It would be beneficial to engage in such a process in the United States if either pay or compensatory time were forthcoming.<p><b>SKILLS VS. COVERAGE</b><p>        A disturbing aspect of high school teaching in the United States is the pressure for "coverage." American syllabi put almost everything in terms of the material covered. It is ironic that the closest thing we have to a national evaluation system, the CEEB achievement tests, help to promote this mentality. Coverage becomes necessary in order to prepare students properly for these tests.<p>        It is admirable that Britain's new National Curriculum in general, and the GCSE in particular, are oriented toward the teaching of skills and have made concessions on coverage in order to accomplish this. The examination for which I helped prepare students was "British Social and Economic History since 1750." Though the course included an odd list of topics and themes to be covered, which at first glance seemed intimidat-ing, everyone knew that there would be a wide degree of choice on the examination itself. Much like the classic Chinese menu that asks for two choices from column A and three from column B, the topics would be banded in such a way that only a few needed to be covered. For example, while all students would be required to answer a question on the Industrial Revolution, they could choose the particular industry (e.g., textiles, iron, mining, automobile) they wished to treat. <p>         At my school (and I understand that this was a typical approach throughout Britain), the school made the choice about which questions the students would answer by deciding which topics to teach. Sometimes these choices were based on the teacher's decision to sacrifice content for skills development, but often it was more a question of the books and other resources available to the school. There was a feeling that the students were incapable of covering many of the topics in the two years in which they had to learn the material, and thus their teachers took them over and over the same topics. The result was that the ownership that might have come from students choosing which question to answer was sacrificed so that fewer topics might be covered. I was told some-thing like this: "When our students get to this section of the exam, they will answer the question on the Poor Laws because they haven't learned anything about the Corn Laws or the Chartists." Several of my fifteen-year-olds on their mock exams chose to answer questions on topics they had never studied because "they looked to be interesting," paying a rather high price to restore their right to choose.<p>        While the mindless pursuit of coverage to the exclusion of all else is not good pedagogical practice, neither is spending excessive amounts of time on too narrow a band of selected topics. Are teachers ever convinced that enough time has been devoted to particular favorite topics if coverage pressure disappears? How many American history classes never got beyond the Second World War because the teacher couldn't sacrifice the crucial details of the XYZ affair? Coverage pressure should certainly be reduced, but I fear a situation in which it is totally eliminated. In my British school, the consequence of inadequate coverage was the elimination of student choice of topics on the examination, not to mention the deadening effects of endless repetition. <p>        The other major danger in stressing skills at the expense of coverage is that "skills" can be viewed by some teachers as simply more material to be covered. Teaching skills by "pouring them into students' heads" offers no improvement over imparting coverage in the same manner. Skills must be coached, necessitating the active partici-pation of the learner who must internalize many of the criteria of evaluation. I tried to do this with my GCSE classes, showing them the mark scheme and encouraging them to grade one another's papers, though all but the top few students stayed heavily committed to their passivity. They resisted my efforts to help them evaluate because they were so used to the teacher doing all the evaluation: "This isn't proper work, sir," they whined. In Newton I always work with Advanced Placement students on how to evaluate their own document-based essays, and they generally feel empowered by the experience of reading and utilizing the instructions to the AP graders.<p>        To bolster this point, I should add that since the advent of GCSE, a number of books have come out purporting to teach the various skills required by the exam. These books contain exercises as well as cookbook-like lists of procedures to be used with each kind of GCSE question. My students insisted on copying down and memorizing the lists for the exam. Faced with intense student insistence, I grudgingly acquiesced on occasion. While these books aren't so bad, they remind me of the review books that help students raise their SAT scores. Such raising is obviously not related to authentic skill.<p>        Along these same lines, I noticed my own tendency to "beat the mark scheme." Any exam with this level of standardization must delineate a hierarchical range of skills tied to a range of scores (see my examples for marking course-work). These "mark schemes," or "rubrics" as we would call them here, are often touted by American reformers as having a beneficial impact on curriculum. They assume that skills can be ordinally arranged and that the attainment of a higher skill presupposes the mastery of all lower ones. I disagree. I do not believe that skills are either mastered or not. Instead, they are learned more or less well, with much back-sliding. Yet, by teaching students to hint at the attainment of a higher-level skill without having mastered it, you can help students greatly improve grades without much of an increase in understanding.<p>        For example, one of the most commonly tested skills on the history GCSE is the student's ability to use and evaluate historical evidence. In all cases, the highest-level skill involves an under-standing of the "limitations of evidence." If students exhibit any degree of skepticism about the value or credibility of evidence, they are auto-matically placed in the highest level of response, so I drilled students until we were all blue in the face. My students could be skeptical about evidence even when they could not fully choose, explain, or evaluate it. I even made up a one-page memoriza-tion sheet, filled with mnemonics and catchy phrases that might help them do the few things that would vault them into higher categories than they might have deserved, given their level of understanding. I entitled it "Your Life Raft," and the students seemed to appreciate it. What is worse, we spent a good deal of time on it (time that might have been more productively utilized), and worse still, I think that it helped many of the students improve their exam results. Were I teaching full time in the British system, it would be difficult to resist the urge to continue to use and expand upon such "successful" practices.<p>        Is teaching to a skills-oriented exam better than teaching to a content-based exam? Perhaps it is, but only marginally so. Teaching to an exam is itself part of the problem. It is no better than teaching to achieve high student grades. Teaching for learning is what is required. The exams and the grades must take care of themselves.<p>        It is worthwhile that GCSE forces schools to be deliberate about the teaching of skills. It is also beneficial that skills are not taught in an abstract way, but in conjunction with the coverage of specified material. However, a new exam, without a change in the philosophy of education, is insufficient. A philosophy that demands an active approach to learning is not automatically insured by a new assessment and evaluation system.<p><b>A-LEVEL</b><p>The most glaring discrepancy between the stated goals of the new reform system and actual practice lies in the A-level exam. Totally summative in nature, its primary purpose is to select candidates for higher education. It makes no pretense of being criteria-based, is completely norm-referenced, and is as much concerned with "can't do" as it is with "can do." The A-level in history gives students two years to learn in great detail a narrow segment of less than two hundred years of history. It greatly stresses content, though in order to pass with distinction, some understanding is required. Most students commit to memory lists of facts which they can regurgitate on cue. Only rarely do questions ask students to compare lists or to use a list in the service of a more general comparison or evaluation. For example, while a question might inquire about French foreign policy goals in a particular period and another might ask about Spanish foreign policy goals during the same period, there would be no question asking for a comparison of the two countries' policies. The most curious aspect of all this is that the same questions are used year after year. Much of being a good A-level teacher involves being able to predict which of the old questions will be wheeled out for this year's exam. When I asked my department head why students did not need to be able to handle such comparative questions as the French and Spanish question above, he told me that "they just wouldn't ask such a question."<p>        The A-level history examination is document-based: students read and evaluate assigned docu-ments, answering questions about meaning and significance. As with the essay questions, the documents are always on the same topic. My students studied the writings of Martin Luther and the reign of Henry VII. All document questions on the exam would come from those two sources. My students carried around anthologies of Luther documents like little Bibles, memorizing pearls of wisdom from his most famous sermons and polemics. I wondered, however, how well they might understand a historical document that they had not studied in great depth.<p>        Comparisons with the CEEB advanced place-ment exam in American history, which I have graded in the past, are telling. On the CEEB test, the questions are never known in advance. Coverage of most of the course material is important (since the hundred multiple-choice questions can test a range of material), though there is some student choice on essays. Document questions are included, but they are always documents obscure enough that the student has never seen them before. Comparative questions are often asked, forcing students to handle material in an assortment of unusual contexts. Though the memorization of material is a necessary condition for doing well, it is not a sufficient one. Profound and thorough understanding is needed in order earn high grades. Transfer on the part of the student is required. Both breadth of knowledge and depth of understanding are needed. In my opinion, it is a better exam.<p>        In 1989, the British education minister did express an interest in reforming the A-level test, too, but declined to do so until another day. That day has yet to arrive. The reason he gave for not doing so was that British teachers were already reeling from all the change. Presumably out of compassion for poor, overburdened teachers, a short hiatus was granted before the next dizzying round of reforms. I do wonder, however, how sincere the reforming zeal in Britain is without a thorough change in this antiquated exam, the flagship of the British exam system. The reason, I feel, is that this is the exam that "counts." It's at this point that the sons and daughters of all Britain's families gain entrance to university. Reform at the lower levels of education is one thing, but would the government monkey with young Percival's chances of gaining admission to Cambridge? If the British are serious about educational reform, they must show good faith by reforming this most important exam.<p><b>BRITISH CRITICISM OF GCSE AND THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM</b><p>When these reforms were introduced, British employers and parents were unsure what to make of them.There were legitimate questions as to how to interpret the test results and the assessment terminology. Especially difficult to grasp for those used to the old system was how to interpret the "no fail" feature of the exam.<p>        Some argued that the reforms lacked rigor. They argued that no one would be fooled into thinking that grades of "F," "G," or "U" were meaningful "passes." These lower marks had been included originally to remove the stigma of failure. They argued that failure was a natural part of any system. They also argued that there was insufficient room for really outstanding achievement and that the highest-level skills as defined by maximum marks on the GCSE were not high enough to measure true excellence.<p>        In the past year, two important changes in GCSE were introduced to placate these critics. Not every student will be given a certificate after all; the bottom students will be given failing grades (as many as 20 percent according to some estimates). Also, two additional levels were introduced to measure the achievements of the truly high-level students. These two new levels will allow the students from Britain's prestigious private schools to differentiate themselves from all others. Both of these changes will function to reintroduce some of the elitism of the old system. When faced with the irreconcilable demands of those arguing for inclusiveness on the one hand and those arguing for the finer discrimination of abilities on the other, the Tory government showed its priorities.<p>        Even before the introduction of these two changes, issues of equity had cropped up. Private school students, who are used to dealing with open-ended questions and abstract ideas, had a natural advantage even if they didn't fully understand or hadn't covered the exam material. My Gloucester-shire students, on the other hand, lacked the intellectual confidence to respond to open-ended questions even if they understood and had studied the material. They required the proper cues in order to activate the knowledge they had mastered. If they felt the slightest bit uncertain about what the question was driving at, they would not respond at all, thus earning the lowest possible marks. My colleagues complained about this from the beginning of the introduction of GCSE.<p>        Other criticisms of GCSE centered on the method of grading. On any exam with a standardized grading system, there is the danger that highly original or unusual work may be unrewarded or even penalized: mark schemes involve setting parameters that often fail to encompass creative responses. Would GCSE pull the gifted down to some mundane norm? If one is tied to the criteria of a published scheme, what is done with responses that don't fit in neatly? On the AP exam, essays are read at a table with readers collaborating on unusual cases, so that consensus can be achieved to bend the grading plan when necessary. Would the British exam have adequate resources to insure this level of individualization?<p>        Lack of resources to do the job was the most commonly heard criticism made by teachers. Not enough support was given to the training of teachers in the new system. Not enough time was given for implementation. Teachers felt that they were subsidizing change that they had very little part in formulating. They were angry, bewildered, and many were leaving the profession. In spite of serious unemployment in Britain, there is a teacher shortage in many areas.<p><b>NO PANACEAS</b><p>        The answer to the education dilemma in both Britain and the United States is easier to formulate than to implement. It is to recruit excellent teachers and then to give them the resources and the space to work together to improve their schools. Prime Minister Thatcher wanted to fix the archaic British education system without spending much money. The National Curriculum was the result. On the whole, the new system will probably end up being less unfair than the system it replaced, but it is not, in itself, sufficient to improve things substantially. It has significant failings. It has been built on the backs of already overburdened British teachers. Reform of assess-ment and evaluation are only a small part of what is needed in Britain.<p>        My British students were intellectually passive in the extreme. Such passivity will not be remedied by changing assessment and evaluation methods alone. Massive cultural change is required for that. Children need to be listened to, and their opinions elicited. The peer culture of students must be changed to eliminate bullying and putting others down. Teachers must stress techniques that promote deep thought and the formation of opinions. Nothing in the National Curriculum addresses this passivity or its causes.<p>        Involving teachers in the process of assessment and in the evaluation of course-work might have served to empower teachers, but it did not. Before introducing educational reform, the Thatcher government chose to break the power of teaching unions and unilaterally remove collective-bargaining rights. Government ministers could not break themselves of the habit of publicly castigating teachers, earning the profession's hatred and contempt. In light of this, too much ill will existed to enlist teachers in the process of reform. Still, the teachers I worked with struggled in earnest to implement the reforms. However, they should have been paid for their time and effort. Instead, the government simply added days to the school year ("Baker Days") during which teachers were enlisted to do extra work without compensation.<p>        Would such assessment and evaluation proce-dures work in the United States? The construction of criterion-referenced rather than norm-referenced exams with collegial consultation about the eval-uation of level-of-understanding performances would, I believe, help American students increase their understanding. I must add, however, that such a collective effort by American teachers would be very labor-intensive and very expensive. Are conservative reformers prepared to spend new money on such an endeavor, rather than simply redirecting money from other badly needed areas into assessment? <p>         The British assessment and evaluation system is not "the answer." As I have stated, just as students study for the SAT, they would probably cram to boost their scores on any skills-based test that we might devise. With traditional teaching methods, skills might become the new "stuff" that teachers poured into students' heads. What's worse, a belief that such a reform in the assessment system is sufficient to solve the nation's education problems would serve to distract us from the difficult, gritty work we must still do in this nation's schools and classrooms. We must avoid panaceas. Among the things we need are the same things that Britain needs: good teachers working collegially, backed by good resources. Efforts to improve education on the cheap will be a waste of limited money and time and will simply delay the day when we begin that long and upward journey that has no shortcut.<p>        What is more serious, and too often neglected by those engaged in the educational debate, is the shape of the society for which young people are being educated. Newton works better than Gloucestershire, not because of its system of assessment and evaluation, but because the "life chances" of most students attending school here are significantly better than for students there. However, if inner-city U.S. students, like their working-class British counterparts, face little prospect for meaningful jobs and a decent life, then no matter how humane the assessment system, they will examine their options and in their own way say, "No, thanks."<p>

It's notjust school either; if we look at how we certify doctors andteachers, we'll see an enormous emphasis on written tests. Too ofteneven writing isn't required. I sure hope airline pilots need to domore to get their licenses than fill in ovals on a multiple-choicetest.<p>        I recently attended a conference held by the Coalition ofEssential Schools to select schools that could be consideredexemplars of reform. About 50 people went through a variety ofworkshops trying to figure out what should characterize such modelschools. I decided to count the number of times somebody said, "Iwant to see it," or, "Show me what it looks like." Everybody wastalking about what these schools might look like, but when it came tohow schools would be selected, it was a different story. "We shouldwrite ethnographies about them," somebody suggested. "Schools shouldsubmit written documentation as proof of their status as an EssentialSchool," somebody else said. Written documentation was the way peoplewere going to see the school and understand how it functions.<p>        Prior to the meeting, participants were asked to read a 25-pageethnography of one school to discuss whether and how it could becalled an Essential School. The study was wonderfully written, and Ienjoyed reading it, but I strongly questioned if this should be theonly way to present such documentation. Herein lies the problem:People want to see it, and writing alone can't show a school.<p>        Seymour Sarason, in his <i>Letters to a Serious EducationPresident</i>, writes:<p>"I and others can talk and write endlessly about what classrooms areand should be..., but we are using language as a way to engender whatwe hope is appropriate imagery. Whatever the power of language inthis regard, it lacks the concreteness and compellingness of seeing."1<p>        But there is another way of seeing. If used correctly, it allowsschools and school people to be seen performing, and allows theviewers to make up their own minds. This medium shows--not tells--whatschool is like. I'm talking about video, and the people to controland produce it should be the educators and students themselves. Inthis paper, I discuss how video provides another way of seeingschools. Video, in conjunction with written documentation, canpresent a clearer picture of what is really going on in schools, andcan become a dynamic tool for accountability.<p><hr><h2>Writing, Video, and Accountability</h2><hr>        Remember the old saying, "Believe half of what you see and noneof what you hear"? How much of what we read about schools should webelieve? Of course, video, like writing, has pitfalls that must beaddressed. But before we take up video, let's examine how writingfosters accountability. Or does it?<p>        I've described writing as primarily "telling." Those of us whovisit schools regularly have all experienced reading something abouta school, then going there and seeing the school very differently.This is as much a fault of the medium as ot the schools. Consider howoften these accounts of schools are narrated by one "voice," thewriter's. This makes for good stories, and good writers get theirpoint across, but it does not mean that what they present is thewhole story, or even the real story. It is only rarely that writingabout schools incorporates multiple voices (teachers, students,visitors) talking about the same thing. Instead, the writer makes allthe selections and frames it--in other words, telling the story.<p>         On first thought, video would appear to be very different: Thecamera never lies. But video too often falls into the same traps, inpart because many who go into video are writers first and lack avisual creativity. Their purpose is to report, or tell, a storyrather than let the story tell itself.<p>         When, for example, we watch the TV news, we are seeing someonetell a story with a barrage of what I call "moving video slides"--10to 15 second clips of an event taking place with a voice-over by thereporter covering the story. The writer is the one actually tellingthe story by selecting and manipulating the pictures we see, and bytelling us what we are seeing. An extreme example of the writer'scontrol over what we see came when NBC rigged the explosion of GMpick-ups in crash tests. Contrast this with the amateur video of theRodney King beating, which allowed Americans to make up their ownminds about what happened.<p>         In the last decade, nature shows on TV have become moreauthentic, and, at the same time, extremely popular, becausebiologists have taken over the production responsibilities for theshows. They could do this because the technology is now easier to useand lighter in the field. The result is nature through the eyes ofthe biologist, not the TV producer--"nature in the raw...animalsdoing what comes naturally."2 Why not show schools through the eyesof educators and students?<p>         Today's video technology is within the reach of anyone who wantsto learn to use it: Teachers, students, and administrators have thepower to control what we see about their schools. Generally when yousee a video on education, it has been produced by people who knowlittle about schools. They tend to cover schools the way they coverother stories: brief video clips with voice-overs, only rarelyshowing any depth. Instead, it is the educators themselves who shouldproduce the videos, not just because they're in the schools already,but because in doing so they become accountable for what theypresent.<p> <hr><h3>Video as Exhibition: Three Functions for Accountability</h3><hr>        Many Coalition schools have adopted the principle of "graduationby exhibition": that students, rather than just accumulating therequisite number of credits, need to demonstrate what they know andcan do in authentic, public ways in order to graduate. Joe McDonaldhas described three basic functions of the exhibition as follows: 1)it "faces outward," bringing student performance into the open forpublic examination; 2) it "points inward," helping the school to seebetter the operation of its own systems by the light of the learningoutcomes these systems produce; and 3) it "presses deeper," movinglearning toward genuine understanding even while assessing it.3 Takentogether, these three functions of an exhibition represent crucialcomponents of a school's accountability system.<p>         Video can be considered part of a school's exhibition, and assuch it supports each of the three functions described above. I'lltake up each in turn, looking at how video: 1) faces outward bycommunicating the school's performance to the community; 2) pointsinward by helping the school develop a reflective capacity and byproviding something upon which to reflect; and 3) presses deeper bycapturing student performance in ways that document growth of realunderstanding.<p> <hr><h3>Facing Outward: Communicating Out</h3><hr>        When we began the "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" tele-workshop4at Thayer, we had in mind a kind of C-Span for schools, which wouldallow viewers to see the process of schooling in depth, both thesuccesses and the failures. Give people enough information, wethought, and let them make up their own minds. By doing so, we wouldbe asking schools to become publicly accountable for these processes,thereby encouraging them as well to get better.<p>         In the early stages of "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" we thoughtthat participating schools might develop video portfolios to documenttheir change process. Taking video, archiving it, and then putting ittogether topically-for example, by the nine Common Principles of theCoalition--would yield a powerful account of how a school is changing.Schools could then share their stories with others, learning from andcontributing to others. The video portfolios might serve twoaccountability purposes: 1) to foster the development of reflectivecapacity for staff and program development within the school (moreabout this later), and 2) serve as a means for the school tocommunicate out beyond its walls.<p>         We often talk about "stakeholders" in our public schools--parents, businesses that may employ graduates and colleges that mayadmit them, state and district education authorities, and thetaxpayers who pay for the enterprise. What do they know about what'sgoing on in schools, and how do they know it? Schools are like ablack box, from which emerge only transcripts, test scores, lettersof recommendation, an occasional local news story (often onlyfollowing an "incident"), and rumors. Video holds the key to openingup that box.<p>         More and more school districts now use local or educationalaccess channels to show the community what is going on in theschools. For example, since 1971, the Salem, New Hampshire, schooldistrict has broadcast over Channel 30 a variety of studentpresentations and projects, such as "A Celebration of Inventions" andseventh grade interactive video projects. Television also helps thedistrict to involve parents in their children's education throughprograms like "Tell Me a Story" and "Helping Your Child EnjoyReading." Informational programs, such as school board meetings andChapter 1 introductory videos, are also broadcast. The medium iscontrolled by the educators and meets the specific needs forinformation of the community. Its effect has been to open up schoolsto the community--the essence of accountability.5<p>         As a teacher, I have used video often to present student work toparents. When parents see the work their children are actually doing,they are able to make up their own minds about it. In my experience,parents are most often impressed by the variety of skills thestudents are learning, and many are moved by what they see. Some whowere initially skeptical about the kinds of projects we are doinghave become supportive of them.<p>         On "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" we regularly air videos fromparticipating schools on topics ranging from assessment toscheduling. These videos allow teachers and administrators to seewhat's happening in other schools without having to visit, which is agreat resource, but is often limited by time and cost. In the future,Thayer and other schools with innovative programs might be portrayedin a "digital school profile." This profile would incorporate video,along with text, graphics, and audio, into a multimedia computerdocument presenting valuable information about the school in aneasily transportable, user-friendly format.6<p> <hr><h3>Pointing Inward: Building Reflective Capacity Within the School</h3><hr>        Video changes people's behavior. I wonder how many students havebeen encouraged to write using a computer by watching the TVcharacter Doogie Howser write in his electronic journal at the end ofeach show. I know that after the TV movie on Thayer, A Town TornApart, portrayed an advisory group meeting, I became more sensitiveto my own advisory. What a powerful tool for changing practice videocould be if exemplary pedagogy from schools were taped and broadcast.<p>         Video can be equally powerful in changing practice within aschool. To prove it, I'd like to tell a story about a video projectwe did at Thayer this past holiday season. One day, unannounced,Dennis Littky, our principal, walked into every classroom andvideotaped each teacher for five minutes. While every teachercooperated, demonstrating the trust we have in Dennis, some teacherscame to me later to ask, "What's he doing?" "I wasn't at my best,"they'd say, or, "How's he going to use it?"<p>         What Dennis and I were doing was putting together the firstpiece of Dennis' holiday present to every teacher, a customized copyof A Town Torn Apart. The first 15 minutes of tape before the moviepresented Dennis, dressed as Santa, sneaking into the teacher's roomat night and giving that teacher a personal holiday greeting in aquasi-evaluative format, describing the things he or she did for theschool over the year and the areas in which Dennis saw growth. Nextcame a clip of Dennis and the teacher talking about the year so far.Finally, we added the piece from the teacher's class.<p>         At our holiday party, we all got together and watched the tapes.Teachers were looking into each other's classrooms and commenting onwhat they saw--something very rare in American public high schools. Iput together a brief feedback sheet to see how helpful these videoswere for teachers and handed them out at our next staff meeting. Someteachers responded that they had never seen what was going on behindthem in their classrooms, or that they had never known they had thisor that mannerism. Seeing the video effected how they taught the nextday.<p>         Of course, not every principal could or should go into teachers'classrooms unannounced with a camcorder and start shooting. But everyschool can work out ways for teachers to see their own, and,eventually, each other's work on tape, and create a forum for talkingabout what they see. Video can become the basis for reflectivecapacity within the school. At Thayer, following the holiday tapesuccess, I asked teachers if I could go into their classrooms once amonth, again unannounced, and tape for five minutes on their personaltape, which then would be available for them to do with as theypleased. Over the course of the year, they would have 45 or 50minutes of themselves on tape. Many responded that they would love todo this. This is a project we will begin at Thayer in September,1993.<p>         When "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" started, it was ourintention to show not only exemplary practices in action, but alsothe real school context in which they occur. When I started to tapeteachers and students, we ran into disagreements in the workshop'splanning group about whether or not viewers would learn more from themistakes than from the successes. We tried to capture the real thingand from that generate the workshops, with some interesting results.<p>         During the "Student as Worker, Teacher as Coach" "Here, Thayer,and Everywhere" workshop, Julie Gainsburg, a teacher at Thayer,invited participants to view her math class and discuss whether shewas acting as a coach while teaching in the front of the room. Sincethere was no voice-over, only a real classroom situation, viewers hadto decide for themselves. Julie learned a tremendous amount from theprocess. Furthermore, the feedback from that workshop suggests thatnot only the teacher whose classroom is presented benefits fromreflecting on real practice. A teacher participating in the workshopwho's been resistant to change said Julie's piece was the best staffdevelopment activity he'd ever experienced, because it was real andallowed you to make up your own mind.<p>         It takes brave teachers like Julie to lead the way for otherteachers to share their classroom work--and their students'--on video.How different would it have been if Julie had written a paper aboutwhat she thought of herself as a coach in that situation? Schoolsneed to create opportunities for teachers to see their ownperformance and their classes' privately, and, eventually, also insupportive forums of "critical friends." These kinds of forums leadnot only to changes in individual teacher's practice, but also in theculture of the school.<p>         The same opportunity for reflection exists with studentperformance. On the most recent "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere"Kristine, a Thayer student, gave the oral presentation part of herSenior Exhibition project. As Kristine is interested in a career incommunications, her "essential question" was: Does the media shapesociety or reflect it? For this workshop, we had a panel of judgesconsisting of a student and teacher from another high school andmyself. Participants at all the sites were asked to use Thayer'scriteria to assess her performance. They were invited to call in andexplain their scoring. Kristine loved the experience, and the staffgained valuable feedback on how we assess exhibitions.<p>         In similar fashion, Linda Nathan, Co-Director of Fenway MiddleCollege High School in Boston, brings video of her students'exhibitions when she does workshops for schools. After showing thevideos, Linda asks teachers, "Is this good enough? Do students havethe skills and knowledge they need to get to the next step?"Discussions among teachers tend to be deep, because they are able tomake up their own minds about the students' performances. Theexperience benefits both Linda, who gains perspective on theexhibition's design and her students' performances, and the workshopparticipants, who gain insight for developing exhibitions for theirschools.<p>         These uses of video can enhance reflective capacity within oneschool or within a cluster of schools. Though we often have the samestudents as other teachers in the school, we rarely look at anddiscuss their work collectively. The videotaped exhibition affordsthe opportunity to see what kind of graduates we are producing, and,from that vantage point, examine the school's systems for helpingstudents get there.<p>         At a staff meeting, we viewed Kristine's performance again, thistime with the goal of giving teachers a chance to develop standardsand reflect on how this might effect their own classroom activities.At Thayer, we tape all our senior exhibitions. One goal of thisdocumentation is to reflect on whether we are truly assessingstudents on the 19 graduation skills we have developed as a staff andwhether students' work has the depth and breadth we value.<p> <hr><h3>Pressing Deeper: Capturing Real Learning</h3><hr>        The third component of accountability deals specifically withstudent performance and how we assess it. As I've written, schoolsare used to evaluating students' work based on written, and morerarely, oral performance. These kinds of assessments tend to besummative: the lab report, the research paper, the paper-and-penciltest.<p>         When we use video to create longitudinal studies of studentlearning, they yield interesting results. In this regard videoreflects the way writing is frequently taught--though not alwaysassessed--these days: as a process. When I taught writing, I wouldalways show my students the letters Tolstoy and Ghandi wrote to oneanother. The writing is messy and full of changes, with wordsscratched out and new ones inserted all over the place. This is whatwriting and thinking really look like--revising words and sentencesmirrors thinking. But books never show us the messiness, and this canbe misleading and intimidating to students.<p>         Video also shows thinking. When you tape someone at work, youtape the mistakes and the successes, something polished writing andprofessionally made videotapes generally lack. The mess is what showsprocess and progress, and making progress is what education is allabout. When we put too much emphasis on the product, we may be losingour best evidence of real learning the progress.<p>         We are already familiar with television programs that presentprocess as a means of learning as well as entertainment--This OldHouse, which teaches about home restoration by following an actualproject, and the Lifetime channel's medical series, which showsactual operations being performed while the doctors explain theprocedure. These shows capture real thinking and learning in theconstruction and medical professions--why not such process-drivenprograms for education?<p>         For our "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere" workshops on "Teaming"and "Integrating Curriculum," we decided to tape our seventh gradeteam at Thayer. Using the Foxfire approach, the teachers decided tolet students develop some of their own essential questions andprojects that would integrate math, science, English, and socialstudies. I taped students as they developed questions. A month later,I taped the same students as they worked on the questions. When weviewed the tapes, teachers were, in Stephanie Brodie's words,"overwhelmed and mesmerized" by the sophistication studentsdemonstrated, an observation they might not have made without theopportunity to see the process rather than simply the product ofstudents' work.<p>         As Collins, Hawkins and Frederiksen have described, we can't"reconstruct" a student's abilities from just one source. With moreways of looking at a student--video, written logs, self-evaluations,etc.--we get "a much richer notion of what a student's abilities are.By enriching the way we assess students, we will enrich the way weeducate them."7 At Brooklyn Technical High School, students workingon collaborative design projects are assessed on written group andindividual logs, the presentations, and the videos of both processand product. With these multiple measures--three out of four of whichare process-oriented--teachers have a much better picture of the depthof each student's real learning.<p>         Videotaping students over their school career--givingexhibitions, collaborating with other students, participating inschool meetings, etc.--provides a picture of change and growth, andoffers a powerful vehicle not just for assessment, but for students'reflection on their own learning. When students see themselveslearning--and we show them that we value that process, not just thegrade--they become more accountable. I think of the movie The Sting inwhich Paul Newman and Robert Redford are much less interested in themoney than the process of putting together and pulling off the"perfect con." The whole movie is really about education, even if itis a con artist's.<p> <hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><hr>        Accountability is inseparable from standards. Sizer, McDonaldand Rogers have written that standards, in whatever criteria orrubrics they are expressed, "come to life in the face of performance,then fade in clarity and power as images from the performance fade."8That's true of standards for students, teachers, and schools. Videois probably our most effective tool for keeping performance alive,without which standards whither to meaninglessness.<p>         I'd like to return to the experience of broadcasting one girl'sexhibition on "Here, Thayer, and Everywhere." Groups of school peoplegathered in approximately 400 sites to watch Kristine's performance,then assess it. A national discussion of viewers concerned witheducation followed. We all left the workshop more informed about whatkinds of standards we should attach to performance. While I'm notsuggesting every student's work should be subjected to this kind ofpublic scrutiny, or anything like it, I will say using video to bringreal student work out of the "black box" of the classroom raisesimportant questions about accountability for student, teacher, andschool performance: Is the student accountable? Her teachers? Theschool? The community? To all, I'd answer: You Bet! The sooner westart talking about the implications of that accountability, thesooner we'll have the schools we want. Video, if it's real, takentogether with writing and other documentation, can furnish the rawmaterial that allows people to make up their own minds. Only fromthat point can we refashion our schools to become truly accountable.<p> <hr><h2>Appendix A: Technical Requirements</h2><hr>        What follows is my list of minimum requirements for a school totake video of adequate quality for the purposes I discuss in thispaper. Of course, if a school has the resources, it can buy muchfancier equipment and expect better results. I'd estimate normalstart-up costs at about $5,000.<p> <ul><li>      <b>Camcorder. </b>A school needs a camcorder that shoots well in lowlight (5 lux or lower) because schools are in many instances poorlylit for camcorders.<li>    <b> Audio. </b>Without good pictures and good sound no one will watchyour video. Since I have not found a camcorder that has a goodmicrophone built in, I suggest you buy one. You should be able to geta good stick microphone for less than $200.<li>    <b>VCRs and editing equipment.  </b>Camcorder salespeople may not tellyou that to get your video into a presentable format you need to dosome basic editing. Videotape is cheap, which is good because you canshoot almost everything, and bad because you'll need to do someediting if anyone's going to watch what you shoot. By buyingcompatible VCR's and attaching them to an editing controller, you canget glitch-free edits and sequence your segments.<li>       <b>Videotape.</b> You should be aware that each time you go down ageneration you lose quality, but videotape is still a veryinexpensive way to document your school. Be prepared to buy a lot andtape a lot!</ul><p> <hr><h2>Appendix B: Getting Started</h2><hr>        Following are some suggestions of how video can be used byteachers and administrators to begin to enhance accountability inevery school. Of course, once a school begins to use video for thispurpose, it will develop its own most powerful uses.<p> <ul><li>     Tape presentations of your students and archive them on eitherclass tapes or individual student tapes.<li>    Look at student performance longitudinally by recording studentsthroughout the year and having teachers and students assess theirprogress over time.<li>       Tape your students working and reflect on the entire process oflearning--not just the end product--for a better and more completeappreciation of student work.<li>     Use video to show parents, community members and others what andhow the students are learning.<li>      Show younger students videotaped examples of what they'll beexpected to do.<li>    Use tapes of yourself and students to generate discussions withfellow teachers about how aspects of your performance and classperformance can improve.<li>    Have students keep their own video resume and documentation forstudent portfolios.<li>     Document the changes you are making in your school to develop aschool video portfolio for the purposes of program evaluation andaccountability.</ul><p> <hr><h2>Footnotes</h2><hr><ol><li> Seymour Sarason.

<html><head><title>CES: Membership: The Application Procedure</title></head><body><hr><h1><center>The Application Procedure</center></h1><hr>The Application for Membership in the Coalition of Essential Schools is designed as an opportunity for the applicant school to make an honest self-assessment of past practice, current progress, and future goals.  To be considered for memberhip, a school needs to demonstrate the ability to meet the necessary criteria, and present a "change strategy" that reflects where the school is, where it wants to be, and how it intends to get there.<p>To apply for membership in the Coalition of Essential Schools, your school should submit a letter of interest accompanied by the following documents:<p><ol><li><b>An overview of your school's exploration and planning processes</b> that describes the length and scope of the period of interest and documents the activities undertaken as your school developed its plan of action for translating the <a href = "../principl/principl.htm"> Nine Common Principles</a> into practice.<p>The decision to redesign your school along the nine Common Principles is ambitious, and the process that your school followed as you prepared your Essential school program helps put current and future practice into context.<p><li><b>A description of the parts of your Essential school philosophy that are already in place.</b>  If a visitor were to enter your school today, what would she see?  To apply for membership, a school must have in place at least a prelliminary program that reflects the nine Common Principles in practice.  The opportunity to describe that program helps schools see what is happening, and what adjustments could be made for the benefit of the students.<p><li><b>An action plan for translating the nine Common Principles into practice</b> in your entire school.

<html><head><title>CES: Membership: Membership Statement</title></head><body bgcolor=#ffffff><hr><h1><center>Membership Statement</center></h1><hr><ul><li><a href = "#statement">Statement</a><li><a href = "#stages">Stages of Membership</a><li><a href = "#criteria">Criteria for Membership</a><li><a href = "#expectations">Expectations for Member Schools</a></ul><p><hr><a name = "statement"></a>The Coalition of Essential Schools is a nationwide effort by teachers,students, administrators and parents in more than 230 member schools -large, medium and small; public, private and parochial; rural, urban andsuburban - to rethink their school's priorities and simplify itsstructure in order to focus on helping students learn to use their mindswell.  The Coalition offers no specific model for changing schoolpractices; rather, each school evolves a plan appropriate to its ownsetting based on a set of nine "common principles."  Each school developsits own programs, suited to its particular students, faculty andcommunity, and member schools serve as examples of a variety ofthoughtfully redesigned schools.  The network offers the opportunity forEssential schools to exchange ideas and strategies for change.  TheCoalition is, at heart, an ongoing "conversation among friends" who agreeupon a critique of schooling and a set of shared ideas that give focus totheir diverse efforts.<p>Essential schools are supported in their work through the Re:Learninginitiative and through regional networks.  The Coalition and theEducation Commission of the States jointly sponsor Re:Learning, designedto help people in all levels of the education system "from school houseto statehouse" work toward the goal of teaching all students to use theirminds well.  Eleven states have so far joined Re:Learning: Arkansas,Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Missouri, New Mexico,Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Carolina.  Regional networks havebeen set up in Northern and Southern California; New York City and State;New England; Jefferson County (Louisville), Kentucky; Greater Houston,Texas; and Broward County (Ft. Lauderdale), Florida.  Each region andRe:Learning state has a full-time coordinator who works with schools asthey rethink their structures and practices in light of the CommonPrinciples.<p>Essential schools have found that successful change efforts require thefollowing:<ul><li>recognition of the need for change<li>commitment<li>a shared vision<li>collaboration among the faculty, leadership, community, and district<li>confidence<li>a sense of humor</ul><br>Those collaborating for change must also be given adequate time andresources to explore and discuss ideas for change.  Because suchbroad-reaching efforts are unlikely to succeed in isolation, theCoalition discourages membership of schools not able to network withcolleagues through a region or Re:Learning state.<p><a name = "stages"><h3><center>The "Stages" of Membership</center></h3></a>Becoming an Essential schools is not the single step of applying formembership in the Coalition but rather a series of stages that begin evenbefore a schools asks for an application and continue long past the timea school officially joins.  Ours is a process whereby schools arecontinually "evolving into" Essential schools.  We recognize that aschool's interest and engagement will vary at different stages in thechange process.  As the Essential schools ideas take shape in the school,the faculty continually broadens its understanding of the <a href = "../principl/principl.htm">Nine Common Principles</a> and their implication forsignificant and substantive change.<p>Prior to membership, a school typically moves through these stages:<p><b>Exploring</b><br>Individuals interested in rethinking their school's priorities and practices initiate a "conversation" among faculty, parents and/or schoolboard members about the nine Common Principles as a way to structurechange.  Faculty members are given the time and resources to attendsymposia and visit Essential schools.  The school works to build thecooperative culture necessary to initiate and sustain on-going change.The school begins to identify obstacles to change and ways to addressthem to determine whether they want to proceed with developing a plan forschool change.<p><b>Planning</b><br>As the conversation among constituencies in the school continues, thewhole school community agrees on a plan of action for the first year ofchanges in the classroom.  The plan should include both a supportingrationale, and an outline of the pedagogical and structural changes to beimplemented.  For example, structural changes might include longerclass-time blocks, smaller students loads for teachers, new criteria for grouping students, common teacher-planning time, teaching teams andperformance-based assessments, while changes in pedagogy and curriculumdevelopment might lead to simplifying curriculum, a focus onstudents-as-workers and teachers-as-coaches, and the fostering of anatmosphere where decency and "unanxious expectation" are emphasized.  Thefaculty begins to work toward consensus on the essential skills and areasof knowledge that students must "exhibit" to earn the school's diploma.The school develops links to colleagues in the regional, state andnational networks.<p>A school may apply for membership in the Coalition of Essential Schoolswhen it has at least an initial program in place with students andteachers and can demonstrate a commitment to the criteria andexpectations outlined below.<p><b>Membership</b><br>When a school joins the Coalition, it is publicly recognized as anEssential school, an active member in a partnership of like-mindedcolleagues committed to improving student learning through the nineCommon Principles.  Evidence of that commitment is visible in the changedpractices of the school.  Member schools serve as exemplars to schoolswithin and outside the Coalition of how the Common Principles may beinterpreted in practice.  They may also work collaboratively withnearby exploring or planning schools.<p>Pivotal points in the continuing evolution of an Essential school are:<p><b>Implementation and Expansion</b><br>With the action plan in effect in classrooms, the school during the firstyear focuses on making needed adjustments as problems arise and onsupporting students through the transition to new learning techniques andresponsibilities.  Plans are developed for the second and subsequentyears of the program.  The faculty continues to develop and refinecriteria and tools for graduation Exhibitions.<p><b>Evaluation and Renewal</b><br>Every two years, member schools assess their own progress and report inwriting on their achievements to date, new or unresolved obstacles tochange and their plans for the next two years.  The specific process forthe self-evaluation might vary by region or state.  In addition, schools are expected to regularly work collaboratively with Essential schoolcolleagues to reflect on the progress of their school, to review andrenew their commitment to Essential school change and to chart a coursefor the future.<p><a name = "criteria"><h3><b><center>The Criteria for Membership</center></b></h3></a><br>The following criteria are considered necessary for acceptance into theCoalition of Essential Schools.  Representatives of the school communityare asked to sign a Letter of Agreement confirming their commitment to these criteria.<p><b>Action Plan</b><br>As part of the application process, school submit a statement of theirlong-term goals, and an action plan for the development of theirEssential school program for at least the next school year.  The planstates the school's new priorities, describes the changes in structures,pedagogy, curriculum and assessment procedures needed to support thosepriorities and represents the faculty's commitment to actively engagestudents in the learning process.<p><b>Consensus</b><br>The Coalition is a school-based reform effort.  Thus, it is essentialthat the faculty of the school demonstrate an understanding of the CommonPrinciples and that a substantial majority agree to work toward theapplication of all nine Common Principles.  Concurrently, the approvalof the governing boards and superintendents is crucial to give the program necessary and continuing support.<p><b>Community Support</b><br>It is vital that the community be involved as a full partner in schoolchange.  Thus, it is expected throughout the planning and membershipprocess that community leaders, parents and other stakeholders take anactive role in the development and implementation of the Essential schoolphilosophy.<p><b>School Coordinator</b><br>To support the ongoing change process, each school identifies aschool-site coordinator to be responsible for exchanging informationbetween the school, the regional or state coordinator and the Coalition and for organizing professional development activities for the faculty.<p><a name = "expectations"><h3><center>Expectations for Member Schools</center></h3></a><b>Commitment</b><br>Any serious effort at change, especially change as ambitious as theCoalition envisions, requires time.  Schools that join the Coalition, therefore, are expected to make at least a four-year commitment.  Thiscommitment reflects the belief that a member school is continually movingtoward the goal of becoming a fully articulated Essential school.<p><b>Whole-School Involvement</b><br>The Coalition is not an "alternative" school program, nor is it a "pilotproject."  Therefore, it is required that every Essential school plan forwhole-school expansion, and expected that the school community at-largebe included in the discussions that shape the program.  While a schoolmay begin its Essential school program with a small portion of its students and staff, the long-term goal is for the Coalition philosophy toshape the entire school.<p><b>Documentation</b><br>Membership in the Coalition carries with it a responsibility tocontribute information to people both involved in and interested in theeffort, including Coalition staff and member schools, regional and statecoordinators, nonmember schools, parents, community groups and thepress.  This documentation will also be used as a tool for reflection inthe two-year self-evaluations, and to establish and further networks among schools.<p><b>Assessment of Progress</b><br>A vital part of the membership process is a periodic "good hard look" atthe amount of progress made and the kinds of difficulties encountered.Both the Coalition staff and member schools feel that self-evaluationsand critical friends' assessments are vital for meaningful dialogue bothwithin the school and between the school and the larger Coalition network.<p><b>Sufficient Funds</b><br>While there is no fee to join the Coalition, a substantial commitment ofdistrict funds over several years is necessary to support the schoolduring the planning and implementation of its Essential school ideas.Coalition-related expenses include on-site professional development andplanning, travel costs and conference fees for participation in Coalitionactivities.  While the specific amount varies from one situation toanother, the school needs to demonstrate that it is likely to havesufficient monies to meet these expenses over the multi-year commitment.<p>Schools interested in membership may contact their local Re:Learning or regional coordinator or the Schools Coordinator at the Coalition.<p><hr><p><a href = "membersh.htm">Return to the Membership page</a><p></body></html>

<html><head><title>CES: Background: Description</title></head><body bgcolor=#ffffff> <h1><center>Coalition of Essential Schools: Description</center></h1>The Coalition of Essential Schools is a highschool-university partnership that works across the countryto redesign the American high school for better studentlearning and achievement.<p><ul><li><a href = "#1">Background</a><li><a href = "#2">Founder</a><li><a href = "#3">Nine Common Principles</a><li><a href = "#4">Staff</a><li><a href = "#5">Publications</a><li><a href = "#6">Essential School Membership</a><li><a href = "#7">Contact</a></ul><p><a name = "1"><h3>Background</h3></a>The Coalition is an extension of <b>A Study of High Schools</b>, aninquiry into American secondary education conducted from1979 to 1984 under the sponsorship of the NationalAssociation of Secondary School Principals and the NationalAssociation of Independent Schools. As part ofits findings, the Study identified five "imperatives" forbetter schools:<p><ul>     <li>Give room to teachers and students to work and learnin their own, appropriate ways.     <li>Insist that students clearly exhibit mastery of theirschool work.     <li>Get the incentives right, for students and teachers.     <li>Focus the students' work on the use of their minds.     <li>Keep the structure simple and flexible.</ul><p>Simple though they may at first sound, these commitments, ifaddressedseriously, have significant consequences for many schools,affecting both their organization and the attitudes of thosewho work within them. It is these consequences that theCoalition addresses.<p>The Coalition (CES) was established in 1984 at <a href = "http://www.brown.edu">BrownUniversity. </a>From 12"charter" schools in four states, the Coalition has grown toinclude more than 150 member schools in more than 30 states.With the Education Commission of the States, the Coalitionsponsors Re:Learning, a partnership with participatingstates to build support for Essential school change at thestate and district levels.<p><a name="2"><h3>Founder</h3></a>Theodore R. Sizer  is founder and chairman of the Coalition.He has beenprofessor of education at Brown University since 1984,serving as chair of the Education Department from 1984 to1989. Before coming to Brown, Sizer was professor and deanat the Harvard Graduate School of Education (1964-72) andheadmaster of Phillips (Andover) Academy (1972-81).  Sizerearned a B.A. at Yale and an M.A.T. and Ph.D. in History atHarvard. Two of his books, Horace's Compromise (1985) andHorace's School (1992), both published by Houghton Mifflin,explore the motivation and the ideas of the Essential schoolreform effort.<p><a name="3"><h3>Nine Common Principles</h3></a>The Nine Common Principles guide the work of the Coalition andits memberschools.  These principles grew out of the findings of AStudy of HighSchools. They call broadly for schools toset clear andsimple goals about the intellectual skills and knowledge tobe mastered by all the school's students; to lowerteacher/student loads, personalize teaching and curriculum,and make student work the center of classroom activity; toaward diplomas based on students' "exhibition" of theirmastery of the school's program; to create an atmosphere oftrust and respect for the school, faculty, students andparents; and to accomplish such changes with no more than a10 percent increase in the school's budget.<p><a href="../principl/textncp.htm">View the Nine Common Principles</a><a name="4"><h3>Staff</h3></a>The CES central staff of about 50 education professionalsand support staff is based at Brown. The staff's work isbroadly divided into three areas:<p>-<b>research</b> on school redesign;<br>-<b>professional development</b> to build local capacity forEssential school change;<br>-<b>collaboration</b> with other organizations to promote areceptive climate for school change.<p><a name="5"><h3>Publications</h3></a>The Coalition publishes a journal, <a href = "../publicat/horace/list.htm">HORACE</a>, five times ayear, a series of progress reports, <a href="../publicat/perform/list.htm">PERFORMANCE</a>, as well as an occasional newsletter and a series ofstudies growing out of its <a href="../publicat/research/list.htm">research</a> work. <p><a name="6"><h3> Essential School Membership</h3></a><a href  = "../membersh/schools.htm">Member schools </a>in the Coalition are diverse in size,population, program, and geographic location and representboth the public and private sector. In addition to memberschools, the Coalition recognizes "planning stage" schoolsand "exploring stage" schools.<p>The Coalition offers no specific "model" or program forschools to adopt. What Essential schools hold in common isthe nine principles which focus each school's effort torethink its priorities and redesign its structures andpractices. Each school develops its own programs, suited toits particular students, faculty and community - hence, notwo Essential schools are alike. The member schools serve asexamples of a variety of thoughtfully redesigned schools.<p>The Coalition creates professional development activitiesand programsspecifically for planning and member school faculties androutinely shares results of its research findings with theschools.<p>                      <a name="7">          <h3>Contact:</h3></a>Coalition of Essential Schools<br>Box 1969, Brown University<br>Providence, RI  02912<br>401/863-3384<p><p><hr><p><a href = "backgrou.htm">Return to the Background page.</a></body></html>

Paradoxically, the residents ofthis one-stoplight town set among rolling hills near the top ofthe Taconic Parkway so valued competence in their educationalfare that they had long served up very different courses to the&quot;general&quot; and the &quot;honors&quot; student. To analyze19th-century British novels with future carpenters and farmersseemed unnecessary; those kids should learn to balance anotherkind of book and leave literature to the college-bound.<P>But these days all that has changed, as Chatham High School entersan era in which both workers and whiz kids must think harder anduse more practical know-how to succeed. Five years after it joinedthe Coalition of Essential Schools, this school has done awaywith tracking altogether and established the same demanding curriculumfor every student. In the offices and shops of this middle-incomecommunity, young people are trying out their school skills throughprojects that link work and studies. And whether they are headedfor college or a construction site, they share a common expectationof excellence.<P>&quot;The cream will always rise to the top,&quot; observes Chathamsenior Paul Flint. &quot;But now it seems as if everybody hasbeen lifted up.&quot;<P>The numbers bear out his perception. All ninth-graders, for instance,now take the demanding Earth Science course once reserved forcollege-bound kids, and 87 percent pass the New York Regents examat its end. Not only do eleventh-grade history classes have &quot;muchbetter classroom dynamics&quot; since students are heterogeneouslygrouped, but on last year's Regents test more students than everscored over 95, teacher Mark Pearson observes. And SAT scoreshave held steadily above state and national averages, althoughmore students are taking them now.<P>Students say they appreciate the variety of methods teachers nowuse to coach all kids towards higher expectations. Phyllis Palladino'stwelfth-grade English classroom &quot;has no back,&quot; someonenotes--no place into which a timid or reluctant learner can disappear.Instead, at tables and chairs grouped around the room studentswork together on one of four separate unit projects, with theteacher moving quietly from one to another. Several kids gravitateto a raised carpeted platform that extends into the room as akind of stage. At one station, a student with reading difficultiescan listen with headphones to Sartre's <I>No Exit</I> on tapewhile the others read it in print. On a large &quot;quote board&quot;students post memorable or familiar references they come acrossin movies or outside reading.<H5><B>College Coursework for Some</B> </H5><P>Chatham's courses have also become more demanding for those whohave traditionally succeeded in academics. In fact, juniors andseniors who write (and orally defend) a college-level paper intheir English class may now receive credit from the State Universityof New York at Albany for a modest fee. Even &quot;AP students&quot;work alongside peers who are at other levels, though they fulfillextra requirements and take the Advanced Placement test at year'send.<P>&quot;It used to be that even honors students didn't expect towork very hard to get A's,&quot; says English teacher Faye Sninchak,whose students' exhibitions one university evaluator has called&quot;the equivalent of college work.&quot; Now, other teachersconfirm, all kids work hard, completing &quot;exhibitions&quot;or projects that require learning in depth.<P>During his junior year, for example, Paul Flint put together acomprehensive economic history of the Ford Motor Company, completewith graphs, charts, and model cars. Such individual projectsnow substitute for the three-hour standardized state Regents examthat once capped the two-year Global Studies course in ninth andtenth grades, says social studies department chair Tom Gavin.&quot;Before the waiver, we lost all of May in reviewing for thetest,&quot; he says.<P>Doing well on paper-and-pencil tests was no guarantee that studentshad learned how to think, Chatham teachers discovered. &quot;Someof our high-achieving students felt intimidated at first, interactingwith a variety of youngsters rather than just the teacher anda select group,&quot; English teacher Phyllis Palladino observes.&quot;They weren't used to making mistakes and taking risks aspart of learning.&quot; At the same time, she adds, some kidsare now succeeding who had never before had the experience ofexcellence.<H5><B>A Context for Success</B> </H5><P>A large part of Chatham's success lies in the new ways it haslinked learning with the larger community. A thriving work-studyprogram lets seniors earn credit as they explore career optionswith mentors from local business and professional offices. Seniorsin Dodie Gearing's Government course may spend 25 to 50 hoursvolunteering for local service groups from schools to soup kitchens.Both these programs are monitored closely to ensure that studentsgain in academic skills from the experience. &quot;I learned morein one day about fractions and ratios than I ever did in school,&quot;one boy told Work-Study coordinator Kathy Stumph after his firstday shadowing a local craftsman. &quot;We're comfortable withletting them stumble,&quot; says Stumph cheerfully. &quot;Thesafety nets are in place. They learn early and in an authenticcontext what happens if they don't meet their commitments.&quot;<P>Chatham's culture is collaborative in other ways, too. Every studentis assigned to a teaching team of math, science, English, andsocial studies teachers, who share daily planning time. Studentsin need of extra hall get after-school coaching from teachersevery day. Parents and kids serve on all important committees.<P>This community still values hard work and a good high school education,but its expectations have clearly shifted since the school setthe hurdles higher for all students. While most of these studentsget a taste of the workplace before graduation, 85 percent ofthem now say they will go on to college. And whether they endup mechanics or mathematicians, these days their schooling aimsto make thinkers of them all.<H5><B>Unifying the Seniors' Courses, a Focus on Transition</B></H5><P>How does one make the transition from a demanding senior-yearcourse load to the world that awaits after graduation? Chathamanswered by creating two cross-curricular requirements all seniorsmust complete to show they have mastered the &quot;exit skills&quot;the community identified as necessary for the diploma.<P>During the first half of the year, each senior creates a &quot;curriculumvitae&quot; binder including a self-portrait in writing, a formalresume, a post-graduation plan, a personal budget including sampletax forms, an analysis of his or her learning style, an applicationfor work or a college application essay, and two letters of recommendation.<P>In the second semester, each student prepares a thirty-minute'multi-dimensional presentation&quot; that draws together andreflects on a theme linking all the year's coursework. By October,the student will have identified the work's focus - such as &quot;power&quot;or &quot;hypocrisy&quot; - and begun to address it using and &quot;essentialquestion&quot; that takes on different shades of meaning in differentareas of study. (Power, for example, could relate to forces andvectors in physics, to government and social institutions, orto literary themes.) Keeping a weekly journal that reflects ontheir readings and insights, the seniors come up with their culminatingprojects, to be evaluated by a panel of teachers, peers, and othercommunity members during presentation weeks in May and June.<P>June brings the community to the &quot;Senior Expo,&quot; a fairthat celebrates each graduate's journey through the high schoolyears. At tables throughout the gaily decorated gymnasium, eachsenior sets a tri-fold display board describing the year's accomplishments,whether they be works of art or high-tech projects. A long rollof paper extends the length of the hall, with &quot;footsteps&quot;tracing each senior's feet, name in one, &quot;Where you're goingfrom here&quot; in the other.<P>Chatham seniors describe the year as an extraordinarily empoweringexperience. Because the twelfth-grade teaching team in thoroughlyintegrated, they may budget their own time, moving freely betweenclassrooms or to the library as long as they sign out. Their coursesyllabi are often flexible enough to let them design their programto fit a special interest or focus. &quot;Because I decide whatto do, and when, and how, says one senior girl, &quot;my workmeans more to me.&quot;<H3><B>PERFORMANCE</B> </H3><P><B>Progress Reports from the Coalition of Essential Schools</B><P><B>Number 11, November 1994</B> <P><B>Editor: Kathleen Cushman</B> <P><B>A continuing series describing areas in which Essential Schoolsare demonstrating significant progress toward change using theNine Common Principles.</B> <P><B>Published regularly by the Coalition of Essential Schools,Box 1969, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912.

<P>
Three seniors have taped a couple of yardsticks to the table in
John Nowacki's physics class, slanted so they can roll a small
steel ball down a track onto the floor. &quot;We've got to figure
out exactly where it'll land,&quot; says Tad Barbour, brushing
his blond forelock out of his eyes. &quot;Got to set this cup
on the floor and catch it on the first try.&quot; He catches Nowacki's
eye, gets the go-ahead to see if his group got it right. The ball
plunks into the cup. His teammates cheer, elated. &quot;We did
it with this equation,&quot; says Dawn Ingots, brandishing a graphing
calculator. &quot;Look, I'll show you how.&quot;
<P>
Five years ago, these students would not have been taking physics
at Noble High School. To get to this school you drive through
a landscape of fields, dotted with mobile homes and silos and
the occasional satellite dish or Dairy Queen. You'll see pockets
of quaintness, but this is not vacationland Maine; this inland
southern region suffers low employment and does not expect much
better very soon. Though its high school is bursting at the seams,
housing close to 300 more kids than it was built for, a new building
will have to wait until 1998.
<P>
But four years ago, Noble High School decided it wasn't going
to wait for the success its kids deserved. In a bold and controversial
leap based on the principle of the Coalition of Essential Schools,
the staff agreed to eliminate lower-track courses altogether,
offering the same challenging curriculum to every student. &quot;If
you do not teach watered-down subjects,&quot; principal Pamela
Fisher declares, &quot;kids will not be able to take them.&quot;
<P>
Noble still offers a wide variety of elective courses, from studio
arts to Latin, French, and Spanish. But classes are now taught
in 80-minute blocks that encourage greater depth. In any course,
any student can go for greater challenge by fulfilling the stiffer
requirements of an &quot;honors&quot; option. As many as 100 kids
have signed up for ten Advanced Placement courses, in which anyone
can enroll. Subjects like &quot;consumer math&quot; have vanished.
And by June 1996, every graduate will have taken four years of
math and science, including advanced algebra as well as biology,
chemistry, and physics.
<P>
Down in the Learning Center, where kids and aides and teachers
cluster around computer stations and tables, special education
teacher Betsey Clark muses on the shock waves that accompanied
the change. &quot;You just can't use the same old lecture techniques
on a mixed group of students,&quot; she says. If everyone's going
to get it, teachers have to come up with new strategies.&quot;
<P>
Quite a few Noble teachers were already using those strategies,
Clark and her team pointed out. As new methods took hold, moreover
-- like cooperative learning, hands-on projects, and real-world
applications -- high-achieving youngsters began to benefit as
much as those who needed a boost to make the grade. These days,
the Learning Center bustles with activity across the spectrum
of student talent, providing individual coaching and technological
support.
<H5><B>Taking the Work Personally</B> </H5>

<P>
Today a look into Noble's classrooms offers an unusual glimpse
of teachers given broad latitude to work with students in whatever
ways they think will work. In one of several temporary classrooms
set up to hold the overflow, Jon Appleby teaches English and writing
to five classes, including an &quot;alternative&quot; for those
who have done poorly in previous years. His syllabus for this
last course rivals those of many college seminars in its thoughtfulness
and passion for ideas. Kids choose four out of ten possible ten-week
units that center around &quot;essential questions&quot; like
&quot;Why do human beings seek risk?&quot; Each unit comes with
a selection of provocative readings, writing assignments, and
presentations; each holds out a tantalizing hook to a student
who chooses to be &quot;different.&quot;
<P>
Waylaid in the halls with a bucket in hand, biology teacher Gerry
Crocker is just in from a field research session with a group
of students. The data they collect, about the effects of development
on two nearby rivers, contributes to a long-term state and local
environmental study. &quot;Our goal is to get kids into research
projects that matter,&quot; says Crocker, who brings a background
in Foxfire and other experiential learning programs to her work.
<P>
Quite a few Noble teachers, in fact, have some degree of special
training they share with colleagues (often in their three hours
of weekly common planning time). The &quot;gifted and talented&quot;
specialist, Susan DeVito, moves freely between classrooms, prodding
teachers to extend extra challenges to all students. John Nowacki
and Jim Andrews bring back ideas from Brown University, where
they trained as Math-Science Fellows on the Coalition's National
Re:Learning Faculty. Scott Edelman is designing a school-to-work
internship program based on his alliance with TERC, the Teacher
Education Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Many other
such connections lead directly into Noble's classrooms, where
kids are &quot;too busy these days,&quot; says Assistant Principal
Peter Meagher, to get in much trouble. Disciplinary incidents
are way down and attendance is up, he says, since the move to
teaming and a tougher academic core.
<P>
By the time the first seniors present their &quot;Senior Celebration&quot;
exhibitions this June, this school will have radically revised
its definition of excellence. New &quot;school learning results,&quot;
based on the Maine Common Core of Learning and demonstrated in
cumulative portfolios of student work, will soon substitute for
Carnegie units graduation requirements. The budget may be shrinking
yearly as Noble faces the challenges of a rural community in transition.
But everything else about this school is expanding - and in this
obscure corner of the nation, a new standard has begun to take
shape.
<H5><B>Noble Progress: Out-Performing State Norms Across the Board</B>
</H5>

<P>
The 1994 results from the Mine Educational Assessment (MEA) tests
were awaited with particular eagerness at Noble High School. Essential
School assessment analysts consider MEA a &quot;good test&quot;
- since its introduction in the late 1980s it has steadily increased
the number of more authentic, &quot;performance-based&quot; questions
that require students to demonstrate higher-order thinking. Moreover,
the Noble class of 1995 had taken the test in spring of 1990,
just as they were leaving a traditional junior high for Noble's
untracked Essential School experience - thus providing a clean
baseline by which to evaluate their progress under the new approach.
Finally, the MEA provides comparisons not only with the state
average scores, but also with comparable students in terms of
demographics - factors like parental employment and education,
which in Noble's case is strikingly low. Little wonder that the
following results brought satisfaction to the school community:
<UL>
<LI>The first class to be completely heterogeneously grouped for
all core academic classes showed a substantial increase across
all subjects in the percentage of students performing in the top
quarter. These percentages leaped from 19 to 31% in mathematics,
from 22 to 26% in science, from 19 to 26% in reading, from 24
to 26% in writing, from 19 to 22% in social studies, and from
22 to 27% in the arts and humanities.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>At the same time, the percentage of students performing in
the lowest quartile dropped dramatically - from 31 to 17% in reading,
from 34 to 13% in writing, from 30 to 20% in mathematics, from
28 to 19% in science, from 30 to 22% in social studies, and from
27 to 20% in the arts and humanities.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The gender gap in math and science performance was virtually
eliminated, in the first classes ('94 and '95) who were required
to take three years of math including algebra and geometry.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Noble students are significantly out-performing comparison
groups with similar rural, poor, blue-collar demographics. And
MEA data shows their aspirations have doubled in five years: from
35% indicating college plans to 69% in 1994. (A similar rise in
aspirations shows up in the sharp increase of Noble students who
choose to take Advanced Placement courses.)
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>For the first time, students in Noble's class of 1995 scored
above the state average in every category the MEA tests.

Brian Potter can tell you exactly how his life has changed since
ninth grade, when he says he &quot;slept through&quot; most of
his classes at Pueblo County High School in Pueblo, Colorado.
&quot;Now, I work,&quot; he says. Defiance, sheepishness, and
pride mingle in his voice as he sits on his desk at the back of
a group of some 20 fellow students gathered for their regular
&quot;advisory&quot; session of support and guidance.
<P>
The other kids grin, nodding their agreement. They range from
freshmen to seniors, honor students to those like Brian, who once
would have had &quot;general&quot; or &quot;vocational&quot; stamped
on his diploma, if he made it to graduation at all. But today,
when asked how many consider themselves &quot;high achievers,&quot;
every one of them raises a hand.
<P>
&quot;I didn't care before,&quot; says Amber Fogle. &quot;These
guys, the ones who always get the grades, I didn't ever talk to
them, even. Now they're my friends. I care so much now - and my
grades are way up.&quot;
<P>
Out in this sparsely peopled desert landscape and overlooked by
Pike's Peak and closed-down steel mills, what has this high school
done to turn around the lives of these kids? The pilot CHOICE
program of 100 students and four teachers, in which they are enrolled,
is clearly just the leading edge of an entire school whose priorities
have shifted since 1990, when its staff began exploring the ideas
of the Coalition of Essential Schools and became the first to
join Colorado's Re:Learning network.
<P>
A new emphasis on deepening the curriculum and raising standards
for all students has begun to seep through County High's bedrock
of traditional teaching. The tracking system has receded, replaced
by classes in which students of varying achievement levels work
together on common projects. More students are taking advanced
courses, scores on standard achievement tests have risen across
the board.
<P>
Such progress can only take firm hold, the school's guiding council
of teachers, parents, and students has declared, as the entire
place rearranges its structures and habits so that every student
is know well and a tone of &quot;unanxious expectation&quot; and
decency prevails. To this end, principal Dick Amman says, PCHS
has taken several steps to make each student's progress the personal
concern of the adults who coach and guide him or her.
<H5>Advising and Mentoring </H5>

<P>
It's tough to know as many as 175 students well as they pass through
your six 50-minute classes in groups of up to 30, Amman points
out. So Pueblo County rearranged its schedule into 90-minute blocks
that meet on alternate days. In one of these blocks, each teacher
meets with a mixed-grade group of advisees - getting to know them,
helping them develop assessment portfolios, and coaching them
toward higher achievement. Meanwhile, because all classes are
longer, more teachers are departing from lecture mode to pursue
more active ( and more time-consuming) teaching strategies.
<P>
Ninth-grade teachers work in teams that share a common planning
period and the same 100 or so kids, so they can coordinate coursework
and instruction. The tenth- and eleventh- grade CHOICE team (for
&quot;Children Having Options in Core Education&quot;), which
integrates four core subject areas using &quot;essential questions,&quot;
is viewed as research and development for the entire staff.
<P>
&quot;We're hoping that other groups of four teachers will try
the same thing,&quot; says Martha Nogare, whose social studies
students can often be found charting mathematical projections
of election trends or doubling up with a science class on a project.
&quot;The 'small school' concept lets our team decide how each
school day will look, depending on what our students need at that
point.&quot; Though CHOICE takes more out of her, math teacher
Connie Miketa agrees, the results in student progress have been
worth it. &quot;In 1989 we had twelve general math classes - what
I call 'pretend math,'&quot; she says. &quot;Now all the kids
get the real thing, and apply it to real-world applications. Everyone
learns to use statistics, for example - not only in math but across
subjects, and not only at beginning levels but right up through
pre-calculus.&quot;
<H5><B>Involvement and Pride</B> </H5>

<P>
In this district where school buses log 5,000 miles a day to cover
an area the size of Rhode Island, drawing far-flung community
members into their youngsters' education is a real challenge.
Yet County High parents, students, and community members serve
on all school decision-making committees. Community business leaders
and parents pair put with students to lead day-long schoolwide
seminars on Essential School principles like &quot;creating a
climate of decency.&quot; Students sponsor conferences about school
change, attracting interested peers from other districts and states.
Parents and school board members attend the Coalition's annual
Fall Forum conference.
<P>
Unisys, a nearby software systems firm, this year donated space
in its nearby headquarters building so 50 County students could
pilot a &quot;Tech Prep&quot; program where they learn to apply
state-of-the-art technologies. A former PCHS math teacher used
community donations to convert a former downtown car dealership
into a district charter school for 80 sixth-through eighth-graders.
<P>
&quot;Our county suffered badly in the 1980s, when a wave of layoffs
in the local steel industry, combined with military cutbacks,
put a lot of people out of work,&quot; says Amman. As the region
took steps to attract investors, he says, the high school realized
its graduates were not attractive to high-tech and other potential
new employers. &quot;These companies value habits like teamwork,
initiative, and the ability to apply concepts in new situations,&quot;
he says. &quot;We had to create a different learning environment
to achieve those goals.&quot; Today, Pueblo County &quot;guarantees&quot;
its graduates to employers and colleges, promising to take them
back for more work if necessary skills aren't there. &quot;We
haven't had any returned yet,&quot; Amman says.
<P>
The giant thrust of this school toward preparing students for
a new future might never have happened without a substantial four-year
grant from the Gates Foundation to four Colorado Re:Learning high
schools exploring Essential School ideas. That money allows PCHS
faculty to learn new techniques like Socratic seminars and experiential
learning, to incorporate new technologies into their classrooms,
and to work out new ways of assessing student achievement. Finally
it enables the school to document the success of Essential School
principles by closely charting student performance.
<P>
But proof shows up informally as well, for those who look. Laura
Sandoval, 15 looks up from the computer where she is creating
a Hypercard project to analyze immigration patterns in American
history. &quot;Last year I slacked off; I wished I had more challenging
work,&quot; she says. &quot;You better watch out what you wish
for! This year it's a lot tougher, and I am pushing to my limit.
I have to go all out to keep my grades up. But I am going for
it. This school makes you care.&quot;
<H5><B>Raising the Bar on Student Performance: The Stats</B> 
</H5>

<UL>
<LI><B>STUDENT GRADUATION:</B> The class of 1994 graduated 89.5%
of its students with a &quot;Guaranteed Graduate&quot; diploma
that fully warrants their ability to meet the standards of employers
or colleges. Only courses in which a student receives a grade
of &quot;C&quot; or better count toward a diploma. Dropout rate
was less than 4%.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>ADVANCED COURSES:</B> 401 of PCHS student, or 42%, completed
advanced courses in 1993-94. Advanced Placement (AP) and accelerated
courses are open to all students, and the school has eliminated
a three-track diploma system that sorted students into college
prep, general, and vocational. Enrollment in AP English more than
doubled between 1991 and 1992. Three years of math, including
algebra and geometry, are required for graduation.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES: </B>On the Stanford Achievement
test, the class of 1995's scores rose significantly - from 76%

<H3><EM>This diverse urban middle school reorganized to give kids
more personal attention, then focused curriculum more deeply on
a few essential questions. </EM></H3>

<P>
A massive earthquake shook the foundations of Lincoln Middle School
in the early hours of January 17, 1994, ripping beams from ceilings
and wreaking havoc in its halls and classrooms. In the weeks and
months of emergency double sessions that followed, the students
and teachers of this greater Los Angeles neighborhood school had
to pick their way across planked walkways and through the mud
and rain, to classes held in temporary bungalows.
<P>
But they were no strangers to the perils, pains, and promises
of reconstruction in the pursuit of an education. For the past
several years, this school has experienced an even greater shift
- not on the Richter scale, but in the familiar ground of teaching
and learning. Shaken by the challenges of the middle school reform
movement and the Coalition of Essential Schools, Lincoln's staff
has reexamined virtually every assumption it once held fast. And
as teachers reshaped their school's practices, Lincoln has not
only survived but grown stronger from the stresses and opportunities
of restructuring.
<H5><B>Building Capacity</B> </H5>

<P>
A 1980s statewide push to make middle schools more responsive
to the developmental needs of young adolescents sparked Lincoln's
early focus on creating a more personal learning environment.
Then in 1990, observes principal Ilene Straus, &quot;Essential
School ideas - particularly the notion that 'Less Is More' - moved
us to deepen what went on in the classroom across the board.&quot;
As they explored new instructional approaches (from writing across
the curriculum to cooperative learning strategies), teachers shared
them with colleagues in a whole-school push to build the staff's
capabilities.
<P>
The school has now restructured into grade-level, color-coded
&quot;core&quot; teams of 100 to 175 students, led by three or
four teachers who know them well and tailor instruction to their
needs. Long schedule blocks encourage the integration of subjects
like English and history, science and history, or mathematics
and science. And the more personal approach has fostered a climate
in which kids and teachers both take students' work habits more
seriously.
<P>
&quot;Ten years ago, typically only the high-achieving students
would come prepared to class,&quot; says Jim Pitcher, who has
taught at Lincoln since 1961. &quot;The others? If they didn't
disrupt the class, they would just get a 0 on their homework and
nothing much else happened.&quot;
<P>
Now, 95 percent of students do their homework &quot;every single
day in every single period,&quot; Straus says, or they attend
a Guided Study period that very afternoon to complete it. &quot;There's
a sense of business about what happens in class,&quot; she observes.
&quot;Yet at the same time it's much more active. The teachers
are no longer standing in front of neat rows and talking . Kids
initiate more work.&quot;
<P>
Jim Pitcher concurs. &quot;The number of students who will take
an active part in their own learning has grown much larger,&quot;
he says. &quot;The weaker students still have difficulty, but
because we're teaching differently they are getting much larger,&quot;
he says. &quot;The weaker students still have difficulty, but
because we're teaching differently they are getting much more
of an education than they once did.&quot;
<H5><B>Grade-Level Questions</B> </H5>

<P>
In Roe Johnston's sixth-grade science class, 35 kids are taking
turns presenting simple machines they have constructed to show
how ancient civilizations solved problems arising from their geographical
locations. Along with humanities teacher Kris Haenschke and the
rest of the sixth-grade team, he has focused the work around the
question,&quot; Whose water is it, anyway?&quot; In their parched
and vulnerable desert landscape, these students have found ways
to relate irrigation systems in Mesopotamia, for example, to the
problems of greater Los Angeles. They follow the same strand in
other classes: calculating the mathematics of low-flow shower
heads, studying the body's need for water, exploring how geography
shapes culture.
<P>
Such &quot;essential questions&quot; also link student work across
each grade level. &quot;What makes a life worthwhile?&quot; is
blazoned on the wall in Jeanne Davenport's seventh-grade English
class, where students read biographies and Shakespeare sonnets,
interview authors and immigrants, and continually connect in writing
their own experiences to the world of literature and culture.
Student writing covers the walls. The year will concludes with
an &quot;exit interview&quot; where community members join in
a review of what kids have found out.
<P>
Eighth graders center their work around the question, &quot;What
is a good citizen?&quot; Each researches a community problem,
then writes a proposal to alleviate it and works to help carry
out the plan. Other Lincoln customs also support a strong sense
of responsibility: Students are trained as peer mediators to resolve
conflicts. A core team of teachers follows and advises every student.
Kids keep the same counselor for three years.
<P>
&quot;They put a lot of emphasis here on helping you succeed,&quot;
Miguel Velasquez allows from his perch on the asphalt playground
where kids of all colors toss balls and banter. Miguel is a &quot;pretty
average&quot; seventh-grade student, he says. &quot;But I am working
harder; I am doing more. They give you a lot of challenges, but
they help you meet them.&quot; Two eighth-grade girls who call
themselves &quot;high achievers&quot; agree. &quot;It helps to
have someone care,&quot; says Erica Glaub.
<H5><B>Honors Across the Board</B></H5>

<P>
The statistics seem to concur. When Lincoln students go on to
Santa Monica's only high school, in recent years their writing
places them disproportionately into honors classes, teachers observe.
And though California's standardized testing scene has been in
chaos lately, student scores have improved no matter how you look
at them. &quot;nine years ago Lincoln students scored in the 60th
to 70th percentile on most standardized test measures,&quot; says
Ilene Straus. &quot;Now it's in the 80s and 90s. Teachers are
doing all their planning together, and we are norming consistent
standards of assessment. We emphasize writing across the entire
curriculum. And it helps that we're aligning with California's
new frameworks and assessment.&quot;
<P>
Santa Monica is known for its commitment to the arts; fully a
third of these students enroll in a choral and instrumental program
that has won widespread praise. The arts also serve as a powerful
magnet drawing diverse groups together; a music assembly that
packs the auditorium looks like a promotional event for a multicultural
program.
<P>
With a 13 percent student turnover rate, Lincoln no longer rests
on the stability of suburbia. Instead, despite adverse circumstances
that would have thrown many institutions into disarray, this school
has developed a new kind of unity, founded on a more inclusive
style of teaching and learning. Some administrators now teach
in the classroom. A collaborative system of decision-making is
in its early stages. Parents come regularly to workshops, in Spanish
and English, on issues of early adolescence. Community mentors
work with at-risk students. The actual earthquake, it seems, is
now mere metaphor. Daily, Lincoln walks the fault line of change.

<H3><EM>This middle school coaches kids steadily in work habits
so they can handle more demanding thinking tasks in class and
in later life. </EM></H3>

<P>
The school doesn't look so old; it's only been around since 1971.
But here in the planned community of Irvine, California, Rancho
San Joaquin Middle School is positively hoary with age. Like an
extravagant plant in this sunny Orange County climate, its district
has grown exponentially throughout the past two decades, adding
school after school to serve a burgeoning population.
<P>
Rancho got the reputation of being the old place everyone would
leave for the dynamic new start-ups,&quot; says Roger King, who
came here in 1986 to teach and later became the school's in-house
professional development coach. Students arrived with widely different
academic preparations from elementary school scattered around
the district; after Rancho they went on to Irvine's conventional
(and nationally ranked) high schools. In between, King says, &quot;It
was a traditional junior high: isolated teachers in classrooms
with closed doors using 'sit-and-listen' teaching methods, and
little recognition of the special needs of students at this age.&quot;
<P>
But in the last seven years a new philosophy has taken hold at
this school, influenced both by the national middle-school reform
movement and by the ideas of the Coalition of Essential Schools.
&quot;We're no longer a teacher-centered school,&quot; says Erin
Hughes, a resource specialist at Rancho since 1986. &quot;We're
student-centered.&quot; And Rancho students now have such an active
approach to their own education that teachers up and down this
system are feeling its effect. Its graduates arriving at Irvine's
top-ranked high schools come much more prepared to tackle demanding
work - not just because they read, write, and do math better than
they used to, say their teachers, but because their attitude toward
school work has profoundly shifted.
<H5><B>First Target: Work Habits</B> </H5>

<P>
That shift happened, teachers here say, because for its first
several years of reform Rancho explicitly taught, monitored, and
rewarded good work habits. An Effort Honor Roll provides rewards
on a monthly basis to students who consistently come prepared
and participate actively in class, bring materials to class, and
use their time effectively. &quot;You can't learn successfully
if you don't have these habits,&quot; asserts Erin Hughes. Students
seem to agree; most report that the work habits program raised
their sights and often their grades.
<P>
Next, the faculty began a campaign to develop schoolwide &quot;habits
of respectfulness&quot; from keeping orderly spaces to conserving
resources and practicing tolerant and supportive attitudes. The
school climate has improved markedly since, Rancho's yearly student
survey reveals. Students are measurably more comfortable asking
counselors for help with academic problems; many more believe
that most teachers take time to answer their questions in class;
and 83 percent now agree that all student get equal treatment.
<P>
&quot;We agree with the research showing that a supportive classroom
and school climate positively influence student effort and academic
motivation,&quot; says Mark Reider, Rancho's new principal. &quot;That's
why we go to such trouble to document and improve our performance
in this area.&quot; Having launched that effort, he says, the
school could move on to its latest campaign: getting its students
into good intellectual habits.
<H5><B>Shaping Habits of Mind</B> </H5>

<P>
The seventh-grade warlords in Brad Hughes's classroom may not
realize that thinking habits underlie the ritualistic swordplay
and tea ceremonies they are enthusiastically enacting as five-tone
music sets the mood of ancient Japan. Integrating humanities and
the sciences in a three-hour block with 29 students, Hughes and
his colleague Cathy Lovejoy, one door down, are working to engage
these youngsters in serious analytical tasks: comparing perspectives,
analyzing evidence, making projections.
<P>
&quot;Earthquake!&quot; shouts Hughes suddenly, and the students
dive beneath their desks for the requisite drill. Minutes later,
they are gathered around tables of five, using wave theory to
analyze actual earthquake data from Japan and calculate where
the epicenter is. It's all part of the warlord game - they'll
get points for letting the &quot;emperor&quot; know how the quake
or upcoming weather patterns will affect troop movement. But it's
rigorous science curriculum along with the concepts and skills
of social studies, art, and language arts.
<P>
All English and social studies teachers now teach humanities instead,
in two long blocks that have reduced the number of students they
see daily by 30, to an average of 100. At least as important,
the faculty now meets regularly to go over how its work provokes
higher-order thinking in students - perspective, analysis, imagination,
empathy, communication, and commitment. As a recipient of California's
restructuring grant, the school has committed to assessing how
student work stacks up against shared standards of excellence.
<P>
&quot;For the first time, teachers here see their job as not only
creating success in their individual classrooms,&quot; King observes,
&quot;but also reflecting on it and analyzing it schoolwide.&quot;
<P>
Michele Rosenblum's seventh-grade class is busy learning sign
language to accommodate the deaf and autistic classmate who will
soon be joining them. Out on the sports fields, Scott Bowman points
out how kids are designing successful fitness programs for people
of all descriptions. In the technology classroom, former wood
shop teacher Bob Mayfield shows the ways students use robotics,
electronics, pneumatics, and solar power to solve problems. Clearly,
most here speak the same language, care about the same outcomes,
share the same values.
<P>
&quot;I know the standards now,&quot; says eighth-grader Jennifer
Barth. &quot;So I work harder, and my teachers help me, because
they know me.&quot; At Rancho, they call that progress.
<H5><B>How Are We Doing? For a Candid View, Rancho Annually Asks
Its Students</B> </H5>

<UL>
<LI>Almost two-thirds of Rancho students say their work habits
and effort have improved this year, and that the effort has improved
their grades. Many credit the Work Habits program and Effort Honor
Roll (which virtually all say they understand), with half of students
saying it encourages them to work harder.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Almost three-fourths of Rancho students say that at least
half their teachers give them the chance for active learning,
not just sitting and listening.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Almost three-fourths say there are different ways besides
quizzes and tests to show what they know or can do in class.

</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Almost 3/4 (74%) believe that their Rancho classes will be
useful in their lives, and two-thirds say that in at least half
of their classes they are learning &quot;to solve real problems.&quot;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>In their humanities classes, conclude roughly three fourths
of Rancho students, they are improving their writing skills; learning
to think about issues and ideas rather than only learning facts;
and learning to identify elements of literature like plot, character,
and theme.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>In math, 81 percent say they're learning math concepts and
skills that will be important later, and 74 percent say they're
learning to communicate about math by writing, explaining, and
demonstrating what they know.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>In science, 73 percent say they're learning to understand
science in the real world, and 60 percent say they're learning
concepts and skills that will be important in their future.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Most Rancho students (73-83%) feel physically safe at school
- evidence that in the context of nationally increasing violence,
the school has maintained a safe environment.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Rancho's efforts toward making a more personal atmosphere
at the school have borne fruit. Students and teachers get along
very well; most (over 70%) believe their teachers like and respect
them, and more than half believe at least one Rancho staff member
knows about their special talents and qualities. But only 36%
believe they get personal attention in class, which has led the
faculty to explore a new student advisement program.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Rancho students say they trust each other (54%) and try to
support and encourage each other (52%). Almost half say they can
share their ideas and opinions without fear of being put down.
Three out of five say most of their teachers are enthusiastic
about teaching.

<P>
Brandee Crowell gave a lesson in Boolean logic this week to the
eighth-graders and their parents who showed up at an open house
to see how they liked Oceana High School here in Pacifica, California.
She had just learned how to mine the Internet for information
on anything from skinheads to smoking laws, and like the rest
of her classmates she was ready to show what she knew. In another
corner, classmate Sudhir Durvasula talked with visitors about
issues in genetic engineering that had come up in science class
recently. Nobody felt much like strangers to each other; through
their community service requirement, Oceana students have become
familiar figures in the hospitals, the day care centers, and the
public library of this working-class suburb of San Francisco.
<P>
That informal evening was just one indicator of how, within this
aging complex of concrete buildings hugging the bare hills against
a sweeping ocean vista, a sea change has begun to take place in
how high school students are regarded by their school, by their
community, and by one another. In the three years since Oceana
adopted the principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools,
this school has not only cut its size in half. It has reexamined
the roles and responsibilities of its teaching staff. It has redefined
what learning looks like in the classroom. And it has broadened
the scope of student work so that real life problems come clearly
into focus under an academic lens.
<P>
&quot;As a freshman, Brandee wanted a more traditional, textbook-driven
experience,&quot; says Lois Jones, who turned a district financial
crisis into an opportunity for reform when she took over as principal
here four years ago. Now, opportunities abound across Oceana's
curriculum for kids to create the process of their own learning
rather than passively receive information from their teachers.
&quot;All you who pass through these portals,&quot; read the signs
over several classroom doors, &quot;prepare to educate yourselves.&quot;
<P>
In Bev Kong's science class, lab groups have just finished separating
a mixture of iron filings, salt, water, and sand into its various
parts and accounting scientifically for how they did it. &quot;In
my old school they would have given us a work sheet with instructions
and we would follow them like a recipe,&quot; says sophomore John
Magee. &quot;Here, they make us figure it out for ourselves.&quot;
The student teacher in Kong's class, a research biologist who
has switched in mid-career to teaching, nods approval. &quot;These
kids are learning to think like real scientists,&quot; he says.
<H5>'Tuning' the Standards </H5>

<P>
The change is coming about partly through painstaking attention
by Oceana's faculty to setting higher standards across the board.
As part of a phalanx of schools restructuring under the state's
1274 legislation, teachers meet regularly for critical discussions
about student work, drawing conclusions about how to shape their
teaching to improve achievement. Humanities teachers bring in
writing samples monthly for these &quot;tuning protocols,&quot;
a method that originated with Essential School researcher Joe
McDonald and which California's reform effort has adopted.
<P>
&quot;We grapple continually with what is acceptable, what is
mastery,&quot; Lois Jones says. &quot;Getting in the habit of
looking at student work pushes our expectations beyond where they
have been.&quot; To help students go deeper, Oceana reshaped its
schedule into 95-minute periods that meet two or three times weekly,
strengthened connections between courses across the curriculum,
and established a midyear &quot;Interim Week&quot; in which students
explore one subject in depth either on or off campus.
<P>
It's not only acceptable but prestigious now to be an achiever
at school,&quot; says librarian Mark Gordon, who coached Brandee
and her classmates on high-tech research techniques. &quot;Critical
thinking and skill mastery are jointly emphasized in every class.&quot;
The exhibition in Gordon's &quot;computer links&quot; course,
for example, asks students to demonstrate individually that they
can log on to the Internet to locate, download, and edit a file
using Gopher technology. More, they must evaluate the factual
validity of the information they retrieve, based on what they
know of the topic. &quot;Do you trust the source? Why?&quot; Gordon
asks them.
<H5>Arts Across the Curriculum </H5>

<P>
One striking area where this school excels is in the arts. Fine
arts teacher Mary Heeb works with every grade's humanities team
to devise an arts component to every unit, then coaches students
as they prepare exhibitions. &quot;The ninth graders were reading
<I>Black Boy</I> in their unit on African Americans,&quot; she
says. &quot;In conjunction with that I introduced a unit on the
blues, where they studied major blues artists and wrote their
own 12-bar blues pieces. Finally each student took a different
section of text from <I>Black Boy</I>, researched its meaning,
and summarized it in the blues call-and-response form. When they
performed the 25 sections together, we had a summary of the book
set in music.&quot; Heeb works with a statewide initiative on
integrating the arts; her experience has helped other Oceana teachers
in developing portfolio assessments across the curriculum.
<P>
That feeling of mutuality extends throughout the Oceana campus,
both students and teachers say. &quot;This school is far more
unified than any I have ever taught in,&quot; says counselor and
veteran teacher Steve North. &quot;Teachers really give students
their trust, and they do not abuse it. You can hand over major
responsibilities to them - in 1993 three freshmen totally organized
our Career Days, for example. Kids and adults all have the sense
that we're in this together.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Ours is one of the poorest districts in California,&quot;
Jones says. &quot;Our budget is in shreds; our classrooms are
bursting. We are hanging on financially by our fingernails.&quot;
Yet because the Oceana staff takes on multiple roles - administrators
are advisors and teachers; classified staff helps in the classroom
- the school has managed to maintain a personal and collaborative
ethos. Meanwhile, the 100 hours of community service every student
performs before graduating has also made new friends in the town.
<P>
On her way into the library with an armload of books, senior Tina
Khatcherian pauses to talk. &quot;I came here in tenth grade with
a 1.6 average, and I'm leaving with a 3.9,&quot; she says. &quot;The
teachers work together to help the students ; the long classes
let us go into things much deeper.&quot; Tina's family never expected
her to go past high school; but now she hosts a cable TV show
for teenagers, she recently led a science class discussion of
race and genetics, and she plans to go on to a four-year college.
&quot;This school totally turned me around,&quot; she says; and
the grin she flashes from the library door is just one success
story among many.
<H5>Aiming Higher, Going Farther: The Numbers </H5>

<P>
Oceana is watching closely as the first students to have experienced
all four years of high school in a restructured environment approach
graduation in June 1995. Compared to the days when Oceana was
a comprehensive high school of twice its present size, the numbers
already look good:
<UL>
<LI><B>TEST SCORES:</B> On the College Board's Scholastic Achievement
Tests (SATs), Oceana students' average verbal scores rose 33 points
between 1991 and 1994; their math scores rose by 25 points.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>ADVANCED COURSES:</B> Only 7 percent of students took Oceana's
third-year algebra and trigonometry course in 1990-91; three years
later, 10.26 percent did. The fourth-year college prep math analysis
course doubled the percentage of students who took it over the
same three-year period.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>POST-SECONDARY PLANS:</B> In 1990-91, 74 percent of Oceana
students went on to two- or four-year colleges; by 1993-94, that
number had risen to 99 percent. The majority opt for California's
community college system, but the number of those choosing four-year
colleges rose by close to 8 percent in that period.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>STUDENT RETENTION:</B> In 1990-91, 4.9 percent of Oceana
students dropped out before graduation; by 1993-1994 that figure
had dropped to .74 percent.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>ATTENDANCE:</B> Oceana has always had high attendance rates,
but they rose from 96 percent in 1990-91 to 98 percent in 1993-94.

<P>
An air of purposeful chaos dominates one wing of Piner High School
in Santa Rosa, California this week. Scattering and clustering
in intense concentration around computer terminals, scanners,
and stacks of research, 250 kids of various ages are comparing
notes on geography, economics, law, and cultures as if their lives
depended on it. &quot;Our teams are racing each other to Tierra
del Fuego,&quot; one girl explains. &quot;We've got to make sure
they know how to deal with anything along the way.&quot;
<P>
To an outside observer, the ten-day simulation project looks less
like school than like the work of a sophisticated software firm.
But at Piner, which organizes its 1,635 students into five autonomous
&quot;learning communities,&quot; it is just another way to get
students to work cooperatively, to actively discover what they
need to know, and to relate their learning to the world around
them.
<P>
Such outcomes are so important, this school believes, that it
has entirely reorganized itself in the four years since it adopted
the philosophy of the Coalition of Essential Schools. &quot;We
were a completely typical American high school - neither Palo
Alto nor Oakland, says principal Joe Sewell. &quot;We were reeling
from rapid growth; Santa Rosa is more city than suburb these days.
The school felt increasingly anonymous; you could walk from one
end of this campus to another without anyone greeting you by name.
What's more, we knew our students weren't being prepared for the
world they'll have to live in.&quot;
<P>
The bold moves Piner took to remedy that situation make it anything
but typical today. Every Piner student now joins one of five minischools
that shape their own themes, strategies, schedule, and governance.
<P>
In the Center for Technology, Environment, and Communication (C-TEC),
for instance, students pursue their studies by working with any
of several ongoing scientific investigations in the community
and at nearby universities. Three other Piner learning communities
- the School of the Humanities, the Piner Academy, and Fulton
Valley Prep - place students in weekly volunteer service where
they can explore new fields or learn leadership and teamwork skills.
<P>
Virtually all the units stress interdisciplinary, project-based
studies, with strong links to real-world applications. In fact,
almost half of all Piner students experience some off-campus learning,
with around 100 community mentors advising them.
<P>
By the students' own accounts, the approach has succeeded. Piner
consistently boasts the lowest dropout rate in the district. And
kids who once slid by unnoticed now burst with new ideas and pride.
&quot;It's harder, but it's much better,&quot; says Rebecca Van
Asdlan, a senior in the School of the Humanities.
<H5><B>More Than 'Getting By'</B> </H5>

<P>
&quot;Back in junior high we would just read the history chapter
and answer the questions at the end,&quot; says Audra Antognini,
a senior in the Piner Academy learning community. &quot;Here we
have to actually do the research ourselves.&quot; In a recent
unit on war, her class read <I>All Quiet on the Western Front</I>
and John Hersey's <I>Hiroshima</I>; then each student analyzed
the significance of a specific historic battle and presented it
to the class. &quot;You have to get a C or better even to get
a grade,&quot; Audra says. &quot;They don't let you just get by.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It's a different way of thinking,&quot; says Cari Leamon
of the Integrated Math Project, a curriculum developed at the
University of California's Lawrence Hall of Science, which she
takes as a junior in the Fulton Valley Prep mini-school. &quot;I
had taken Algebra 2 twice and failed it; but now I have a 4.0
math average.&quot;
<P>
Many Piner seniors must complete a major independent project before
graduation, and frequently these arise from their service learning
experiences. Jeremy Wade developed an interest in medical science,
for instance, by working in the city's public health office, where
he surveyed how tobacco advertisers target teens. Now he is combining
math science in his senior project on genetic engineering. For
his weekly service learning project, Juan Tapia rides with the
sheriff on his rounds; he has researched the history of juvenile
justice, and plans to go on in the field of corrections.
<H5><B>The Measure of Quality</B> </H5>

<P>
Given California's chaotic testing scene, reliable statistics
on student performance since the changes are hard to come by.
The state's new performance-based assessments (known as CLAS)
are mired in controversy and will not even be given this year.
But several other measures of quality reveal key improvements
in the past several years:
<UL>
<LI>Piner's restructured offerings were some of the first non-traditional
courses in the state to receive the University of California's
coveted &quot;A-F&quot; accreditation, which denotes academic
rigor and content at a college-prep level. In fact, in the three
years since Piner launched its innovative ways, the number of
seniors meeting all the A-F requirements rose from 118 to 162
(39 percent of its graduating class).
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The number of students who go on to four-year colleges has
steadily risen in the same period. The highly regarded Santa Rosa
Community College, a low-cost feeder school for the U.C. system,
enrolls about half Piner's graduates.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Merit scholarship awards by dozens of organizations to Piner
graduates nearly tripled in three years, from $326,000 in 1992
to $981,000 in 1994.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Parents, students, staff, and administrators share decisionmaking
on Piner's governing council.
</UL>

<P>
This campus feels different now - at once more personal, more
serious, and more fun. &quot;Many kids and parents resisted the
changes at first,&quot; says 30-year veteran Kathy Juarez, who
teaches in Fulton Valley Prep. &quot;But that has changed as they
begin to experience the new excitement that is showing up in kids'
work.&quot; To watch Piner students gather - in classrooms, in
courtyards, and around library tables - offers incontrovertible
evidence that she's right. Their faces lit with pride, these young
people are speaking about work that really matters, both to them
and to their community - and they know it.
<H5><B>Student Work Shows the Difference: Some Projects from Piner
High</B> </H5>

<P>
<I>Monique Dugars</I> is one of many C-TEC students who work on
the Groundwater Monitoring Project, a field study begun in 1991
to determine the impact of gravel mining on the Russian River
aquifer. The Sonoma County Board of Supervisors, to whom the group
reports its finding, has estimated the value of the project to
the county at $500,000.
<P>
<I>Lee Homesley</I>, a senior in the Humanities mini-school, is
directing and producing George Axelrod's play &quot;Goodbye Charlie&quot;
in a local church hall, with proceeds to go to the church's hunger
relief project.
<P>
<I>Matt Sandoval</I> is one of ten students who organized Spanish
lessons twice a week in three area elementary schools. The students
develop their own 30-minute lesson plans, speaking Spanish during
90 percent of their instructional time.
<P>
Based on political, geographical, and cultural advantages, <I>Kevin
Izard</I> and his classmates in Piner Academy's humanities class
set about, in small groups, analyzing which spot in the world
is best to live in. Each group then published a magazine and made
an oral presentation to support their choice.
<P>
Seniors in Fulton Valley Prep, participated in a mock trial of
a white security officer charged with beating a black suspect,
adapted from the Constitutional Rights Foundation state mock trial
competitions. Students took on many roles, writing pretrial motions
and opening and closing statements. Lawyers from the Sonoma County
Bar Association served as judges.
<P>
C-TEC senior <I>Deanna Clark</I> has joined an archaeology project
through Sonoma State University, investigating ground near the
Oakland freeway that collapsed in the 1989 earthquake.
<P>
For his senior project <I>Wade Wilson</I> is building a device
to measure whether low-level radiation from electro-magnetic fields
has a mutating effect on <I>e. coli</I> bacteria, an original
project he developed with his father, a microbiologist.
<P>
Students worked with the city Department of Public Works and the
region's Water Quality Control Board to engineer a test site analyzing
&quot;non-point-source pollution&quot; in Santa Rosa, then produced
brochures and TV spots to educate the community about the hazards
of run-off contaminants in their storm drain systems.
<P>
In a five-year project with biologists at the University of California's
Bodega Marine Laboratory and Reserve, students collaborate on
field research into wetlands habitats and the endangered species
they support.

<P>
The teacher looks young - barely older than his students. But
Jason Teague takes his task seriously. And it is only after he
finishes working aloud through the reasons one of his students
is falling behind that one realizes this member of the Salem High
School tenth-grade teaching team is only eighteen himself.
<P>
It's just one way this suburban Atlanta school, still wet behind
the ears, breaks out of the conventional mold to match its practice
to its rhetoric. If we value students as active workers, Salem
seems to say, why not take their intellectual contribution seriously
giving due respect to their questions and aspirations?
<P>
In the slick, high-growth corporate culture of this booming New
South town, Salem has stuck its neck out to achieve an intellectual
productivity previously unheard of even in these well groomed
suburbs. As the first Georgia member of the Coalition of Essential
Schools, it has vested ownership of its mission in teams of teachers,
reshaped the school day into long blocks to encourage deeper engagement,
and dramatically redrawn the lines of expected student behavior.
In such a risk-taking environment, Jason's venture into a team-teaching
internship seems almost routine.
<P>
The first class of Salem's seniors graduates in June 1995 from
the school that began in 1990 with sixth through ninth graders
and has since worked its way up to senior high status. Like Jason,
some 45 of 231 graduates will have pioneered the &quot;executive
internship&quot; program in which they serve as helpers two days
a week in Atlanta's professional community, keeping close records
of what they learned along the way.
<P>
But any of these students will tell you what else they have learned
here over four years of an Essential school experience. Salem's
unorthodox mixing of all students in two-hour academic blocks
at first drew protest from parents who thought it would pull down
challenge levels for higher-achieving students. Instead, students
say they are working harder than ever and enjoying it more. Attendance
figures and test scores back them up. Salem students have a higher
attendance rate and a lower failure rate than the other high schools
in the district. And in 1994, as average SAT scores dropped for
seniors in comparable county schools, Salem's juniors outperformed
their older peers by an average of 66 points.
<P>
<B>Teaching to the Top</B> 
<P>
People thought the classes would be dumber, that they would teach
to the lower level,&quot; says senior Rebecca Pitts. &quot;It
didn't turn out that way; it was whatever you made it.&quot; During
the school's first years any Salem student could achieve honors
status by taking on demanding independent projects within a course,
with a mentor and an outside review board.
<P>
&quot;From eighth through tenth grades I did honors projects in
pretty much every class,&quot; says Ruchi Gupta, a junior. &quot;For
my humanities course I interviewed Tom Murphy, the Speaker of
the Georgia House; I talked to his enemies and other State House
people, too. It was a pain - they were always canceling on me.
But I got a lot of help from my mentor here at school.&quot;
<P>
The attitude of excellence spread to embrace all students, even
those who conventionally would have been separated for more basic
classes. &quot;Two of our special needs students built an amazing
scale model of the Globe Theatre as we were studying <I>Romeo
and Juliet</I>,&quot; says language arts teacher Allison Wright.
&quot;If they hadn't been in a mixed group they would never have
done something that required so much outside research!&quot;
<P>
The president of the senior class Hal Loper, grins agreement.
&quot;I am so dyslexic that when I write it is like another language,&quot;
he says. &quot;The help I have gotten from this school is outstanding.
I did an internship at the Secretary of State's office in Atlanta,
and next Saturday I am going to sit in on a class with Newt Gingrich,
who teaches at the college I am going to sit in on a class with
Newt Gingrich, who teaches at the college I am going to.&quot;
A politician already, he shakes his head. &quot;I have a few questions
for him.&quot;
<P>
<B>Waivers? What Waivers?</B> 
<P>
Georgia's Governor Zell Miller came to Salem High in 1993 to sign
into law the state's &quot;charter schools&quot; bill, which allows
schools to apply for blanket waivers from the state. And Salem
is also a demonstration school for the state's high school restructuring
project. But principal Bob Cresswell looks bemused at the mention
of red tape. &quot;Turns out nothing we're doing requires any
waivers,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;Anybody could do it.&quot;
<P>
To encourage flexibility and productivity, Cresswell has turned
over substantial authority over how the school day works to his
staff. Teams of four teachers in Salem's core subject areas work
together with groups of 100 students in ninth and tenth grade,
in a project-rich curriculum that commonly crosses disciplinary
lines. Each team sets up its own schedule within a four and a
half hour block of academic time. Both special education and gifted
education teachers move through all classes to ensure that kids
receive the help and challenge they need.
<P>
<B>The J-Curve to Success</B> 
<P>
In algebra classes, for example, all students are coached to perform
the same demanding tasks. If their final assessments show low
scores their transcript may give credit in &quot;math&quot; instead
of algebra, but they stick with the group. &quot;Two years after
Angie Weekly failed Algebra 1, she finished Algebra 2 with one
of the highest averages in the class,&quot; boasts teacher Lynn
Fore.
<P>
By eleventh grade, teachers team more loosely, as projects demand
and interests warrant. Any student can elect Advanced Placement
courses, and the faculty concedes that some prove more ambitious
than others. Even in the upper grades, though, Salem holds to
its &quot;J-curve' philosophy of continuous improvement, arguing
that any work below a B is not good enough.
<P>
&quot;All kids can learn,&quot; declares tenth grades team member
Frances Freedman. &quot;But some need more time - how much depends
on a lot of different factors. Rather than emphasizing a certain
grade by a certain date, we concentrate on what you must achieve
so you can go on to the next thing. If you can write a complete
sentence only 70 percent of time the state will give you credit
for passing. But you write like a mess - why would you want to
go on to the next grade, much less on to college? With the J-curve,
we say, &quot;Why don't you take it further and get a B?&quot;
<P>
<B>Honors, With a Difference</B> 
<P>
The approach seems to have galvanized these students to new levels
of prowess. Three Salem tenth-graders qualified in 1993 for the
prestigious Governor's Honors Program, usually reserved for eleventh-graders.
The school won second place in the region's literary competition,
with a ninth-grader taking first place in the state. In math competitions,
mock-government simulations, and other such arenas Salem has racked
up a string of awards.
<P>
But these students clearly put most stock in their success when
it pushes past convention to break new ground for all. Salem's
chapter of the national Beta Club honor society, for instance,
found a way to ensure that their special needs peers could be
included in the club.
<P>
&quot;Everybody has their own gifts,&quot; declares eleventh-grader
Kelita Wiley. &quot;Like if I can show this kid something, he
can show me something different.&quot; Salem's peer mediation
program, she says, makes a good example of how her schoolmates
help each other. &quot;The first year we opened, every week there
was some kind of physical fight. They chose a very mixed group
of 20 or 30 kids to be peer mediators, and right from the start
you could see the fighting drop.&quot;
<P>
These students also feel that their work matters, both to the
school and the community. Sophomore J.C. Aevaliotis recalls a
ninth-grade project in which his team designed a stadium and field
house for the high school, and brought it before the school board
for consideration. Rebecca Pitts found herself in court fall term,
helping the district attorney's office fill out plea forms for
defendants who could not read or write. Trained by Atlanta's Alliance
Theater, the student drama group conducts workshops in local elementary
schools.
<P>
&quot;Last year our team did a project called 'Beyond the Year
2000,' where kids had to research and present projections for
some field,&quot; recalls tenth grade teacher Suzanne Gebhart.
&quot;They could do anything from transportation to medicine to
computers - one boy did an amazing project on air transportation.&quot;
Some students, she says, chose to envision the future of education.
&quot;Strange,&quot; Gebhart muses. &quot;A lot of the things
they said would happen some day were already happening here at
Salem High School.&quot;

<H3><EM>A climate that emphasizes family connections and celebrates
mastery has driven student achievement at this working-class elementary
school to record heights. </EM></H3>

<P>
Oakland Park Elementary School has a merry air about it, like
a small child bursting with a secret. Though it is the oldest
school in Fort Lauderdale and registered as a national historical
landmark, its graceful cloistered walkways, stucco walls, and
red tiled roofs somehow lose their sober gravity as lines of children
of every color troop through on errands or run up to a teacher
for some pressing exchange of news. Outside its wrought iron gates
the modest cottages go on for blocks, home to the working-class
families whose kids come here; at the nearest corner is the busy
boulevard with its auto shops and fast food joints.
<P>
In the principal's office sits Gay Nichols, a member of the school's
parent advisory council, ready to help wherever she can. Her second-grader
Ashley is the youngest of seven, and this sun-weathered mother
has seen the inside of well over a dozen other schools in Broward
County in her time. &quot;This whole staff really cares about
children,&quot; she says. &quot;You feel like you're part of the
team.&quot;
<P>
Moreover, the school has changed dramatically, she asserts, since
principal Larry Katz arrived in 1990 and brought the ideas of
the Coalition of Essential Schools with him. &quot;The children
really love to come to school now, she says. &quot;And you can
see their marks going up every year.&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Oakland Park's delicious secret does lie in student achievement,
as much as it does in the affectionate partnership the members
of this school community openly display toward each other. Their
pride is well founded; in the last four years these children have
shown unheard-of progress by every measure.
<H5><B>Scores Up, Behavior Better</B> </H5>

<P>
&quot;In 1990, the school had suffered a seven-year downward slide
of test scores,&quot; Katz says. &quot;We began a school-wide
conversation about the Coalition's Nine Common Principles and
how we could improve our performance through practicing them here.&quot;
<P>
Improve they did. On the Stanford Achievement Tests in reading
between 1992 and 1994, last year's fifth graders rose from the
36th percentile to the 52nd percentile, moving from six percentage
points below the district average to seven percentage point above
it. In math, their scores leaped from the 40th percentile to the
63rd, while the district average edged from 55th to 59th. Oakland
Park's rising scores are even more impressive for its minority
students; last year's math scores for Hispanic fourth-graders
skyrocketed from the 27th to the 73rd percentile. And on Florida's
new performance-based writing assessment, schoolwide scores also
rose steadily.
<P>
Student behavior has also shown sharp improvement during the same
period. &quot;In my first spring here I saw at least eight fights
every day at dismissal time,&quot; says Katz. Now, even in the
midst of disruptive construction as the school expands, such fighting
is &quot;almost nonexistent,&quot; he observes. Through a consistent
policy of intervention that includes peer mediation as well as
direct consequences for good and bad behavior, discipline referrals
at the school have dropped in half in the past year.
<P>
Teacher Pam Keel serves not only as the Essential School coordinator
here but also as a behavioral specialist in a new state-funded
program. &quot;I am available to help with any behavior problem
on short notice,&quot; she says. &quot;I go into classrooms regularly
and work with groups, and I can also pull kids out for help when
their behavior is getting in the way of academic progress.&quot;
<P>
Focusing on a schoolwide tone of decency, Keel says, has definitely
helped children academically. &quot;We have more time to teach
now that discipline has improved,&quot; she notes. In addition,
several other changes have made it easier for staff to focus on
helping children learn more effectively.
<H5><B>Cross-Grade &quot;Families&quot;</B> </H5>

<P>
The faculty reorganized classes this year, for example, into multi-grade
&quot;families&quot; that include teachers and students from kindergarten
through fourth grade. &quot;It's not just a social system; we
buddy up for all kinds of things,&quot; says Pam Tindall, who
teaches one of the school's nine mixed-age classes of first and
second graders. &quot;My class regularly goes to read and write
with a third-grade class. I can tell it has a big effect on improving
quality - their work takes on much more importance to them.&quot;
<P>
In Mary Terwilleger's fourth-grade classroom, kids at long tables
work together on analyzing the science of weather in written documents.
When they finish, they will troop over to another of the school's
portable classrooms to teach the information to a younger class.
&quot;We approach reading, writing, and math all through the point
of view of science,&quot; says Terwilleger - a curricular innovation
typical of this faculty's commitment to new ways of learning.
<P>
In another nearby classroom, Tracy Spayd coaches 20 fifth-graders
whose academic performance has put them at the risk of dropping
out. &quot;The state gives us extra funding to work intensively
with these children in grades four and five, and we have extended
the program on our own into the third grade,&quot; says principal
Katz. His concern for remediation also extends to families, especially
because Oakland Park is host to a continual stream of immigrants.
(The school's turnover rate is 36 percent.) At tables in the back
of the school auditorium, a dozen mothers are working on learning
English or studying for the high school equivalency exam with
child care provided for their younger children on the premises.
<P>
It typifies the tone of this school that teachers refer to student
exhibitions as &quot;celebrations.&quot; Children openly share
a stake in each other's success - as peer tutors, for example,
or on the morning closed-circuit television show where kids show
off their latest projects. &quot;We consciously focus on making
things cooperative, not competitive, among the children,&quot;
Pam Tindell says. Physical education teacher Tony DiPierro adds,
&quot;They take responsibility for handling challenges among themselves,
even refereeing their own games.&quot;
<P>
In the small lunchroom, teachers compare notes and trade materials
on ideas ranging from puppet shows to photo journals. The faculty
meets regularly in family groups, grade-level groups, and study
groups that discuss Coalition principles. &quot;There are a lot
of avenues for people to express things and come up with new ideas,&quot;
says Pam Keel. &quot;Every teacher has the freedom to use his
or her own style.&quot;
<P>
The outside community has also joined the effort: local banks
and restaurants share information and resources, and even the
shrubs that line the walkways near a maze of portable classrooms
were planted with the help of a nearby center for handicapped
youth.
<P>
Larry Katz points proudly to a recent questionnaire in which 95
percent of Oakland Park third-graders agreed that they liked going
to this school, and 99 percent of fourth graders said they plan
to graduate from high school. In his office and glad to be there,
Gay Nichols looks back on her time as a mother of seven and shakes
her head; these statistics are by no means par for the course.
&quot;You don't find many schools this good,&quot; she says. &quot;I
haven't seen it any better.&quot;<SAMP>Essential School Principles, Grade School Setting</SAMP>

<P>
On the walls of the teachers' lunchroom at Oakland Park hang several
sheets of newsprint, on which the members of the Coalition study
group have made notes from their latest meeting, about how various
Essential School principles showed up in their classroom practice.
A few samples:
<H5><B>Principle 3 (goals apply to all students, means to goals
vary):</B> </H5>

<UL>
<LI>Share materials between grade levels; dialogue among teachers
<LI>Focus on the process to produce a quality product that reflects
a child's ability
<LI>&quot;Over-teaching,&quot; using a variety of methods and
activities to develop concepts
</UL>

<H4><B>Principle 5 (student as worker):</B> </H4>

<UL>
<LI>Children monitor each other's behavior
<LI>Students generate classroom themes and lists of spelling words
from reading

<LI>Students serve as teachers and coaches to each other
</UL>

<H5><B>Principle 6</B> <B>(demonstration of mastery):</B></H5>

<H3><EM>In the midst of its population explosion this middle school
improved student performance by strengthening team structures
that make school more personal and inclusive. </EM></H3>

<P>
Only when a fire drill fills the halls of Coral Springs Middle
School does one get a true sense of the awesome energies that
2100 young adolescents can unleash in a school built for 1300
- and of why the staff here eliminated bells in favor of a flexible
schedule that avoids this scene wherever possible. The northwest
corner of Broward county is growing and changing so fast that
Coral Springs, a high-achieving and affluent community faced with
an influx of new faces and new needs, has had to adapt in every
way it can.
<P>
But in the classrooms and faculty rooms of this middle school
one soon senses a commitment to change that goes far beyond convenience.
&quot;when it comes to teaching and learning, teachers and kids
here speak the same language now,&quot; says Susan Bruining. She
has seen the school through five years of change, during which
it embraced the principles of the Coalition of Essential Schools,
and she testifies to a steady rise in the quality of work from
students of every academic description.
<P>
In practice, the no-bells policy plays out this school's stated
goal to help all children learn to their full potential. As long
as the kids get to lunch on time, Coral Springs' 19 teams of five
or six teachers have full authority to arrange the daily schedule
for their 160 students. While the school bustles with comings
and goings, a sense pervades of order, purpose, and shared values.
<H5><B>Every Voice Matters </B></H5>

<P>
In part, this can be laid to a foundation of trust and cooperation
among faculty, parents, and administration that was many years
in the making. When principal Sharon Shaulis took over in late
1994 from her predecessor, Frances Vandiver, the staff had spent
six years developing a shared decision-making procedure, talking
over its goals, and restructuring the school to reflect them.
To personalize learning they tried breaking the huge student body
into cross-grade &quot;houses&quot; of around 700 students. Teams
of teachers devised interdisciplinary projects and met weekly
before school to share innovative classroom strategies. Parents
started coming to the school for study groups, and ten students
from each grade sat on the governance council.
<P>
At the same time, the faculty began to eliminate the rigid tracking
that had placed students with special needs in separate classes
with little academic emphasis. Exceptional students now join a
regular team whose teachers are supported by a specialist, and
share the same grade-level work as their peers. &quot;no one's
complaining that their kids are no longer in the basic class,&quot;
says Shaulis wryly.
<P>
Test scores back up the efficacy of such &quot;mainstreaming&quot;.
Mathematical reasoning skills for eighth-graders have improved,
standardized tests show, since the school threw out its low-track
math courses. In 1993, the first year every Florida eighth-grader
took the state's new performance-based writing assessment, Coral
Springs led the district; 1994 and 1995 found the school in second
and first place again. &quot;Even our special needs students scored
within the same range as regular students in the district,&quot;
Shaulis observes. The results decidedly support research by University
of Illinois professor Robert Felman, whose studies show scores
rising consistently in middle schools where teachers share substantial
planning time.
<H5><B>Writing, Writing Everywhere </B></H5>

<P>
The push to improve student writing across the curriculum has
brought this school's faculty together around another common goal.
In Shelley Kaiser's eighth-grade social studies class, students
paired up to produce newspapers describing the causes, progress,
and results of the American Revolution. Along the way they got
coaching in expository and persuasive writing from English teacher
Allison Jaffe, and their work was scored using both a history
and language arts rubric. (See sidebar.)
<P>
Math students also work regularly on communication skills. In
their quarterly portfolios, for instance, they are asked to think
through a problem they missed on a test or assignment, explaining
the correct solution and why it works. And in one two-week unit,
students argued out the mathematics of a complex political and
environmental problem involving drilling for offshore oil deposits
in New England.
<P>
Like many of this school's initiatives, the commitment to raising
writing standards has had its effect on the district's other schools.
Many Coral Springs Middle School teachers are now trainers for
national Writing Project workshops or other summer offerings sponsored
by the county.
<P>
Making sure that new approaches carry through from the early grades
to high school is also a priority in this district. Coral Springs
Middle School teachers share professional development with five
nearby elementary schools and a high school in a K-12 &quot;Innovation
Zone,&quot; which focuses on learning to identify and reach students
with different learning styles, creating &quot;high-option environments&quot;
to help them succeed.
<H5><B>Demonstrating Understanding</B> </H5>

<P>
Coral Springs' math department has also taken a leadership role
in raising standards for students at every level. &quot;We piloted
a program in which all kids worked with pre-algebra concepts early
on,&quot; says teacher Christine Flynn. &quot;Every teacher chooses
from a menu of applications and resources so they can find the
best entry point for each student.&quot;
<P>
This school's emphasis on developing higher-order thinking skills
is perhaps most evident when one drops into classrooms at random
and watches students at work. In Susan Fronrath's sixth-grade
social studies class, two girls dressed as Sumerians present an
exhibition on that ancient culture to an attentive audience of
their peers. The talk is laced with modern-day comparisons, enlivened
with homemade artifacts, strongly organized, and rich in content.
The girls field questions with aplomb, drawing analogies to everything
from American slavery to the pharaohs of Egypt. Using a time line,
they augment each other's explanations of Sumerian religion, geography,
and culture with impromptu examples. At the end they list and
evaluate their sources. The class has taken notes, expecting to
need what they are learning some day soon. And in this rapidly
expanding county, one has little doubt that they will.
<H5><B>The Challenge: Improving Student Writing Across the Curriculum</B>
</H5>

<P>
Coral Springs Middle school teachers Allison Jaffe and Shelley
Kaiser recently asked their eighth-graders to demonstrate their
understanding across both social studies and language arts. &quot;Was
the American Revolution inevitable?&quot; they asked, and double-blocked
their classes so students could carry out sustained work on the
question throughout the unit. For their exhibition, students prepared
not only a persuasive essay but Revolutionary-era &quot;newspapers&quot;
describing and analyzing the war's causes, progress, results,
and major characters. They drew political cartoons, created crossword
puzzles to elicit important facts, and editorialized on the dilemmas
of the time. To do well required mastery of a range of skills
in research, reading, critical thinking, and problem solving.
No less, the assignment revealed students' progress in both expository
and persuasive writing. A few sample excerpts follow in unedited
form:
<P>
.....The new King did not take into consideration that after 200
years of living separate lifestyles that a sudden change back
to harsh English rule would make a spark, that would eventually
cause a tremendous fire. Their cultures grew so far apart that
you could not tell that the colonies were ruled by the British
anymore. The American colonies set up their own system of government
which differed greatly from the English government. The British
did not see that the colonists adapted to the new way of life
in the Americas....(David Arenson)
<P>
....Some believe that the war was won through luck, but others
felt it was due to our advantages. How could that be? The British
had more advantages than us, or did they? They had paid, experienced
soldiers, but our volunteers were fighting for a cause. At stake
were our ideals and our freedom! Another advantage was that we
were close to home. The British had a navy, but that only gave
them minimum control of the coast. Their generals were not usually
promoted for their abilities. This caused bad judgment and careless
mistakes. Our leaders....were selected because of their abilities
which meant good judgment, the respect of the troops, confidence
and strong leadership. There were some disadvantages too though.
For instance, the British had money and we did not. At least the
money we did have was worth practically nothing. We had hardly
any power to raise taxes and therefore could not gain anything
that way. So, to sum it all up, we may have had less advantages,
but the ones we had were the ones that counted. (Sabrina Salvitti)

<P>
It's a shabby classroom in a warren of dismal, odd-shaped rooms
converted from old office space. The kids are former dropouts
from city schools, their prior records showing only failure and
truancy. Yet the hour-long discussion that follows around their
table - probing, passionate, and superbly argued - could rival
classes at the most elite schools in the system.
<P>
This is Jay Pecora's history class at the Chambers Street site
of New York City's Satellite Academy, a hard-pressed public alternative
school for kids who need another chance to prove they can make
it through high school. These students are saving themselves from
failure, and they have the ever-present sense that what they think
and read and do can help.
<P>
Gizelle Thorne, 17, describes the spread of the West African religion
of Yoruba to the Caribbean, Brazil, and the United States and

Prompted by a classmate's question, Aleshia Gibbons dissects the
term &quot;monotheistic cosmology.&quot; Jay Pecora keeps prodding
the class to go another step, make comparisons, reach for evidence
both from outside research and from their own experiences. At
the break the room is electric with the sense of something gained
far beyond this modest topic - something &quot;less&quot; that
is becoming &quot;more.&quot;
<H5><B>The Power of Revision</B> </H5>

<P>
This unusual 780-student school operates in four autonomous sites
in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, with fewer than 200 students
each. One principal, Alan Dichter, provides leadership to all;
and the separate staffs share a common vision, often collaborating
on curriculum, assessment, and teaching strategies.
<P>
Since it joined the Coalition of Essential School several years
ago, the Chambers Street site, near City Hall in downtown Manhattan,
has pushed steadily toward raising the quality of student work
and demonstrating mastery in concrete ways.
<P>
Teachers coach &quot;Learning to Learn&quot; classes - which develop
key academic skills through reading, writing, discussion, and
cooperative group work on substantive academic topics. And this
year, as they helped students assemble materials for the first
round of graduation portfolios, they came to realize the extraordinary
power the concept of revision holds for these students, in both
schoolwork and life.
<P>
&quot;Selecting portfolio pieces gave us a way to reflect in common
with students on the fact that you can correct your errors,&quot;
says Alan Baratz, the school's coordinator who has taught at Satellite
almost since its beginning in the early 1970's. &quot;That can
mean so many things - not only to our kids but to us as a school.&quot;
<P>
Even the multi-step process of applying to Satellite tests a student's
will to revise the attitudes and habits that have led to previous
failures. 'Everybody here has the same story,' declares student
Dana Jones, &quot;Before, we didn't go to school, - now we do.&quot;
<P>
In the daily &quot;Strategy Group&quot; meeting that brings together
students and their adviser for reflection on personal and academic
progress, several of Daria's peers back her up. &quot;I<B> </B>never

says Daisy Jefferson, 19. &quot;Other schools tell you, 'I taught
you that, so if you don't get it, too bad.' Here they want <I>to
know </I>that you know it.&quot; In the astronomy course Mike
Hamburg teaches, Daisy says, 'the work is. hard - you have to
really construct it in order to understand.&quot; (The large scale
model of the solar system that her class created now adorns a
school passageway, flanked by posters reporting on solar nebula
theory and other topics.) With help from the teacher and her peers,
Daisy keeps her grades high enough to serve on the school's governing
council. And she aspires to become a doctor: &quot;I'm just taking
a little more time than I was supposed to!&quot;
<P>
A soft-spoken 18-year-old who is reluctant to give his last name,
Daniel &quot;literally played hooky for two years straight&quot;
before coming here. &quot;My attitude has changed completely,&quot;
he says. &quot;I'm here every day, and I expect to graduate in
June and go on to college.&quot;
<P>
Students agree that teachers' involvement contributes more than
any other factor to their own reversal of fortunes. &quot;You
can't learn in a place where they don't know your name,&quot;
Mack Adessa explains. &quot;I am a motivated student when I feel
it's worth it.&quot; Their academic commitment matters just as
much as the faculty's personal attention, Marion Gonzalez asserts.
&quot;Teachers here have more passion for what they teach,&quot;
she says. &quot;And it rubs off! I never used to write; now I'm
writing all the time, and taking writing classes.&quot;
<H5><B>Fewer Courses, but Longer</B> </H5>

<P>
Students here spend much of their four-period day in classes designed
to support their academic turnaround. New students take a term-long
Orientation class and spend two semesters in the interdisciplinary
Learning to Learn course. Those preparing to graduate meet for
&quot;The Future of You.&quot; Just seven other courses fill out
the school's offerings, their topics varying from cell biology
or human rights to Hamlet or the rain forest. But classes run
long and go deep into the issues.
<P>
In a class called Problem Exploration, Frank Casden coaches students
to use strategies for mathematical thinking. &quot;You don't concentrate
on the answer,&quot; says Chakar Jones, huddling with his classmate
Paul Spivey over the financial details of a sports star's contract.
&quot;You guess and check, or you work backwards, or you find
a pattern or make a chart. I didn't really like math before, but
I like this class. You learn more.&quot;
<H5><B>Another Try for Respect</B> </H5>

<P>
Equally important goals at this school are the habits of respect
and tolerance, support and responsibility, honesty and trust.
Student boards issue binding academic tracts to anyone who regularly
fails to show up on time; certificates reward those with good
records. Training in conflict resolution comes with orientation.
To be here at all, students have to want to succeed. &quot;They
know that things did not work out, and they choose personally
to make another try,&quot; says Baratz. Many of those who stick
it out, he notes, later go into social work for a career - and
it's easy to see why.
<P>
We only had two bad fights last year, and that's way better than
most of the schools I've been in,&quot; says the district security
guard routinely assigned by the school district to police these
premises.  She smiles with satisfaction.  &quot;They call this
a school, but I call it a community.&quot;
<H5><B>Up Toward the Future: Satellite Students' Trajectory</B>
</H5>

<P>
Tracking the success of this alternative school depends on a clear
understanding of its students' profile before and after they choose
to attend. Some indicators:
<P>
<B>Students arrive older. </B>On average, Satellite students are
17.5 years old when they are admitted. Though few arrive with
more than a tenth-grade standing, they can expect to complete
Satellite's graduation portfolio requirements in about two years.
With the school's help many also take on concurrent courses or
internships, either in local community colleges, technical cooperative
programs, or experiential learning programs.
<P>
<B>Students have prior attendance problems. </B>About 50 percent
have actually dropped out of school, and another 20 percent have
been truant (absent more than 21 days in a 90-day term) at their
previous schools. Their &quot;mobility rate,&quot; which combines
transfers, dropouts, and other transient situations, stands at
65 percent, compared to 29 percent city-wide. Chambers Street
site attendance has shown steady improvement since joining the
Coalition, with 82 percent of students present each day, based
on data collected with strict attention to accuracy.
<P>
<B>Students have previous academic failure.</B> On average, students
have earned only one credit (of 14 possible) during the year immediately
before entry, and almost never have passed their classes in the
preceding term. About 200 students of the 780 in Satellite's four
sites graduate each year, which places the school sixth in the
city for percentage of total population graduating. Over half
(54 percent) of Satellite students graduate; another 30 percent
move on to graduation equivalency programs or leave the state.
Those who graduate typically move into post-secondary programs,
including two- and four-year city and state colleges and some
private colleges.

merely a creditable academic record. Kids and teachers also commit
to &quot;challenge comfortable limits&quot; in respect, tolerance
and trust. </EM></H3>

<P>
A civilization called Kel sprang into being this term at Souhegan
High School in the small town of Amherst, New Hampshire. The brainchild
of Arthur Bruno - who presented it as his Senior Project to a
spellbound panel of peers, teachers, and visitors - Kel bore all
the hallmarks of a newly discovered ancient society- evidence
of a written language, meticulously, reconstructed maps, even
clay fragments bearing alphabetic runes. &quot;Do you believe
in Kel?&quot; Arthur asked his audience, and unanimously they
did.
<P>
It is typical of the remarkable culture of this three-year-old
Essential school that Arthur's academic mentor, classics teacher
Nancy Baker, also serves as the administrative assistant to principal
Bob Mackin. If there is a mold to be broken, Souhegan will find
a way to break it. And although academically Souhegan students
are already rising well above where they were headed just years
earlier (see sidebar), more striking still<I> </I>is their &quot;respect,
trust, and courage&quot; - which is blazoned on the vision statement
in the entry hall, and which informs every endeavor this school
takes on.
<P>
In the classrooms and hallways of this $12 million building whose
windows reveal the green landscape of rural New Hampshire, students
describe a new sense of agency both academic and personal. 'We
are the indigenous people of Souhegan High School!' declaims junior
Courtney Banghart from her place in the collegial arrangement
of desks in Gary Schnakenberg's Global Studies class. Her joke
refers to the course readings, but the point is real: in 1996
Courtney's class will be the first to graduate after four full
years here.
<H5>Mastering the Material </H5>

<P>
&quot;I feel like we're learning more,&quot; says Matt Babineau.
&quot;Working in groups seemed strange at first, but then it forces
you to feel responsible to the group and that makes it matter
more.&quot; Dan Hogan agrees: 'It seems
<P>
like the goal is not so much the grade now as it is mastering
the material.&quot;
<P>
In many ways, the academic experience at Souhegan is designed
expressly to demonstrate Dan's point. Rather than study algebra
and geometry in sequenced year-long courses, for instance, students
enter on a three-year math program that integrates concepts from
both those subjects. A comparable approach, marks the science
curriculum, which spirals through-life science, physical science,
and chemistry. During their first two years students immerse themselves
in American history and culture; thus grounded, they branch into
the study of other world cultures in the junior year humanities
course.
<P>
Students of all ability levels study in mixed classes, with teachers
providing more time, support, and challenge as necessary. Nine
advanced or college-credit courses are open to any student who
chooses them. And all seniors fulfill their English requirement
via a daily minute interdisciplinary seminar combining extensive
reading and writing with, for example, a focus on the scientific,
social, historical, and political aspects of an environmental
issue.
<H5>Demonstrating a Passion </H5>

<P>
In every instance, the preferred method of following student achievement
at Souhegan is public &quot;exhibition of mastery,&quot; and the
required Senior Project stands as the culminating example of that
practice. In this closely tracked 60-hour &quot;personal learning
experience,&quot; each student independently investigates a special
area of interest with the help of a faculty mentor. The last weeks
of school at Souhegan are a continual celebration of their accomplishments,
as each presents the project to an evaluative panel
<P>
The results can be stunning. Working with Northeastern University
research scientists, seniors Holly Leddy and Lesley Baker in 1993
isolated a mutant gene in a nuisance species of brown algae along
the Massachusetts coast. In Souhegan's lab, says mentor Dan Bisaccio,
'they ran 36 electrophoresis gels, which take 24 hours each, then
spent a week in Boston proving their thesis through statistical
analysis.&quot; Despite the real significance of their work, Bisaccio
notes with pride, &quot;they had the integrity to qualify their
results in their report because their sample wasn't large enough.&quot;
<P>
Other projects reveal a similar authenticity. Anne Small's 1994
experiment with Goeldi's monkeys at the New England Science Center
landed her in Hershey, Pennsylvania to present a scientific paper
at the North American Zoological Conference. In a 1995 project
that far outstripped her previous academic record, Rhonda Ledoux
studied the failure to thrive of a three-year-old relative. Kara
Power presented a study of Martha Graham, complete with a monologue
and performance in that dancer's characteristic style. And Rory
Duffield electrified his audience with a hand-made display and
historical review of medieval chain mail and other armor.
<P>
Students with special needs are folded into Souhegan's classes
with the same expectation that they will stretch the limits of
achievement. Junior Amro Diab has a disability that prevents vocal
speech. But in Edorah Frazer's humanities class he used a language
board to perform the &quot;yes-no&quot; refrain of a call-and-response
poem his class wrote, and he has served as place-kicker for several
football games this year. Todd Phoenix came into Souhegan as a
tenth-grader with a failing record; he just completed a senior
project on the sculpture of Michelangelo and Rodin and will attend
the Rhode Island School of Design next fall. &quot;It was just
a matter of recognizing where his, talents lay and running with
it,&quot; says his adviser Sally Houghton, beaming.
<H5>Setting a Personal Tone </H5>

<P>
The tone of decency that marks this school can be laid in large
part to its advisory structure, which groups ten students and
a staff member for 25 minutes daily of academic and personal support.
Advisory groups also elect the 25 students who join 20 teachers
and parents on a community council that sets policy on most internal
school affairs. Among other moves, the students voted to ' eliminate
class rank, moving to a decile indicator system instead.
<P>
In this small-town environment where everybody knows everybody,
the results of fostering such a culture are perhaps particularly
evident. &quot;I see kids who would <I>never </I>have been leaders
in middle school, and because of what we have to do here they
are so much more confident and capable!' says junior Amy Wheeler.
After a musing moment, she adds proudly, 'I'll bet that if you
put any student here in a situation anywhere in the United States,
that person would run out to be a leader.&quot;
<H5>Stacking Up Success: Souhegan Takes Its Measure</H5>

<P>
<B>SAT scores.</B> Before Souhegan opened in 1991, only 59 percent
of students from the towns it serves took the SATs; their mean
score for math was 473 and for verbal 448. By 1994, the third
year of Souhegan's existence, 83 percent took the college-entrance
tests, and their mean scores jumped to 513 in math and 472 in
verbal-levels well above state and national averages.
<P>
<B>College Acceptance.</B> Among New Hampshire's public high schools
with graduating classes of over 35 students, Souhegan ranked second
only to Hanover High School in the percentage of students accepted
to college.
<P>
<B>Recognition.</B> The school was named New Hampshire's 1994
Secondary School of the Year by a consortium of educators and
businesses giving Excellence in Education awards. And in 1995,
Souhegan principal Robert Mackin received the group's Secondary
School Principal of the Year award.
<P>
<B>Academic Challenge.</B> All students must take three years
of demanding math science courses; the school offers no watered-down
&quot;basic&quot; or &quot;general&quot; math courses. More than
half of Souhegan students are taking Advanced Math by junior year,
and fully 16 percent of seniors take calculus. All students take
at least three years of study in a foreign language, and the school's
156 seniors have signed up for a total of 235 Advanced Placement
or college-credit classes.
<P>
<B>Costs and enrollment.</B> Souhegan spends approximately the
same amount as New Hampshire schools of comparable size - $7,221
per pupil in 1995, not counting the mortgage on its $12 million
building. Enrollment is growing, with a dozen tuition students
enrolled and more on the waiting list.

<H3><EM>From their first day at this middle school, students work
on projects at computers and when they go on to high school, they
take an electronic record of their learning with them. </EM></H3>

<P>
Sixth graders introduce themselves with a splash in their first
group project at Pierre van Cortlandt Middle School. Using a simple
computer layout program each designs a &quot;business card&quot;
describing the characteristics he or she brings to their advisory
groups.
<P>
A few months later, these students are negotiating the electronic
network of their middle school as easily as do professionals in
a well-run company. At terminals throughout this classic Depression-era
building, they log in their passwords and call up individual folders
in which the work of their three years here accumulates day by
day.
<P>
And when they move on to high school, they will take with them
a multi-media final exhibition of their best work here - as individual
as the faces, voices, music, art, and writing that each one's
disk captures. Many graduates are so used to using technology
as a learning tool that they come back to use PVC's well equipped
labs when they carry out high school assignments.
<P>
The last place you might think to look for 21st-century schooling
would be this sleepy Hudson River Valley town of Croton-on-Hudson,
an hour north of New York City. The teacher's secretary, Barbara
Zajac, remembers marching across the street as a second grader
the day the school opened in 1940; her children went here too.
But Essential School ideas combined with a substantial grant from
IBM have caught up the entire district in a push toward active
learning and authentic assessment that has won it a leadership
role in the state and the nation.
<P>
Before long, the work of Croton students from kindergarten through
high school will be followed and assessed via the digital portfolios
of a pioneering Exhibitions Project run by the Coalition of Essential
Schools and IBM. Benchmark examples available over the Internet
will help schools around the state and the nation share their
norms of excellence.
<P>
In the meantime, technology has dearly hooked kids here into the
excitement of hands-on projects they might never have tried before.
<H5><B>More Interest, More Pride</B> </H5>

<P>
&quot;The computer makes it easier and more fun,&quot; says Morgan
Lorenzen, who in sixth grade produced a newspaper describing his
&quot;research trip&quot; into the Amazon in search of the double-crested
basilisk. In the process he learned desktop publishing, research
techniques using CD-ROM materials, and how to use clip art and
an image scanner- as well as a great deal about the rain forest
habitat. &quot;I am glad to announce that I will go back to the
Amazon again,&quot; the young professor declares in print.
<P>
&quot;Using computers really helps students invest themselves
in their work,&quot; says principal Gerrie Paige, &quot;even students
who have difficulty reading and writing. They can easily revise
and rethink it, or add in new material. And it looks better, so
they take more pride in it.&quot; After a piece of completed work
has received its final grade, she observes, students often revisit
and improve it. &quot;It contributes to a culture of revision,&quot;
Paige asserts.
<P>
Hand in hand with technology, this principal acknowledges, must
come practice in the art of framing good questions, evaluating
data, and making connections with a flood of newly accessible
information. Eighth grader Naomi Feinberg, for example, brings
out a computer-constructed pie chart describing her research into
the relation between after-school activities and homework completion
among her schoolmates. (&quot;Kids who do activities actually
do more homework than those who don't,&quot; she observes. &quot;I
think it's because their minds must be busier.&quot;)
<P>
&quot;Computers can't do that kind of work for you,&quot; says
science teacher Joan Quilty. &quot;But they seem to make my students
more interested in finding things out, analyzing them, and presenting
them in a high-quality form.&quot; Her seventh-grade teaching
team devised a &quot;world tour&quot; project in which students
research a region and compare its geography, sociopolitical situation,
and demographics to that of the United States via spreadsheet
analyses and travel brochures.
<P>
David Fannon shows the Revolutionary War-era newspaper he wrote
and produced in seventh grade using Pagemaker. &quot;I really
got interested in the British spy John Andre, partly because he
was from this area,&quot; he says. &quot;Reading biographies of
him and of Benedict Arnold got me going on other military men,
and I read a biography of Eisenhower and then one of Montgomery.&quot;
<P>
Other PVC students also say their reading has not suffered from
increased computer work. &quot;I like to read,&quot; says Brett
Posmentier, 12. &quot;I just finished <I>Shiloh. </I>&quot; Another
student, who has special needs in reading, eagerly mastered Pagemaker
and then wrote and produced a manual for other students on how
to use it.
<H5><B>Building on Skills</B> </H5>

<P>
From the sixth-grade business cards onward, PVC's curriculum aims
for an ever-widening circle of opportunity to use technology in
the classroom. By second semester of eighth grade, they are ready
to prepare a culminating exhibition, using Hyperstudio on the
school's Macintosh computers, that makes use of everything from
video recordings to writing, math, and original art. In the school's
&quot;unified arts&quot; area, teacher Dean VanDeCarr coaches
students who come and go freely to use the bank of high-tech equipment
in presenting the best of their learning thus far.
<P>
&quot;Next year we'll have a district-wide IBM-based assessment
portfolio that keeps an ongoing academic record of every student's
progress,&quot; says VanDeCarr. &quot;The Hyperstudio portfolio
is more a personal celebration.&quot; Over two months students
collect, select, and reflect on their work with the help of Jan
Felt and others on the eighth-grade team. By June, when visitors
and parents press the mouse and click on a button, the faces and
voices of these eighth graders will describe their activities
and projects; show their essays, problems, and inventions; and
demonstrate in digitized motion what they have done.
<P>
Some students don't stop at that. As eighth graders in 1994 Erin
Towler, Sally Reynolds, and Sam Reisner created an interactive
multimedia simulation of a murder mystery that was later published
by Apple Computers. &quot;To do it we had to know about the justice
system, but we learned that in seventh grade,&quot; Sally says.
'The hard part was thinking all the parts of it through, working
it out together, and then getting all the details to come out
right.&quot;
<P>
Her teachers, some of whom appear in the game as suspects, nod
sagely. They don't seem to mind that two years after leaving this
school, its students still come back to revel in how much they
learned, and how much fun they had doing it.
<H5><B>Student Work Comes Alive in Multi-Media Portfolios</B>
</H5>

<P>
The main screen of Pierre Van Cortlandt's Hyperstudio multimedia
eighth-grade portfolio displays the name and photograph of the
student, who introduces her work orally if one clicks the mouse
on the &quot;message&quot; icon. One can also call up work-photographs,
artwork, video clips, or written text, each accompanied by the
student's explanation and reflection-in five categories: 'Aesthetics,&quot;
&quot;Problem Solving,&quot; &quot;Communications,&quot; &quot;Research,&quot;
and &quot;Beyond Class.&quot; There's no hiding behind a transcript's
grades or numbers in this final report; instead, these portfolios
offer a powerfully vivid look at the quality and style of actual
student accomplishment. Some examples from 1995's graduating eighth-graders:
<UL>
<LI>In front of a concert audience during Black History Month,
Jared Watkins reads &quot;How Can People Be So Wrong?&quot;, his
poem about the Dred Scott decision after the style of abolitionist
poet John Greenleaf Whittier. Elisa Golfinopoulos plays a difficult
clarinet piece she has been working on all year, and displays
pages from an illustrated children's book she revised several
times (&quot;despite my resistance&quot;) under the persistent
coaching of her teachers.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Casie Smith includes pictures and lab report text from a science
project demonstrating her understanding of electricity,- a &quot;grant
proposal&quot; she wrote after reading part of Jonathan Kozol's
<I>Savage Inequalities; </I>family photographs and a narrative
in which she takes on the voice of her grandmother, a Scottish
immigrant, and an oil painting in the style of Bob Ross that she
painted in her own time.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>&quot;Inclusion&quot; students with various special needs
meet the same high standards of thoughtful comprehensiveness.
Technology has helped those handicapped by substantial physical
or learning disabilities to present their work at its best, and
even to surpass their peers sometimes in originality and resourcefulness,

<P>
A Chevy pick-up that runs on solar electricity gleams in the spacious
workshop of Mt. Everett Regional School, the names of local merchants
blazoned on its sides. &quot;The kids had heard about the big
New England race,&quot; says Paul O'Brien, who teaches technology
and applied math here. &quot;So four years ago we began converting
this old thing. Now for two years running we've beat out Ivy League
teams to win the race in our category.&quot; He and his students
went to the capital for a ceremony at the U.S. Department of Energy
- and meanwhile, the school district uses the vehicle for maintenance
tasks around town.
<P>
It's the kind of project - original, hybrid, challenging, practical
- that one comes to expect, visiting the classrooms of this newly
built school nestled near the Housatonic River in the Berkshire
Hills of Massachusetts. At every turn, students of all ages are
making things, exploring places, experimenting with new ideas,
and using their community as a place both to learn and to give
of themselves.
<P>
Each morning at 8:05 in the school's television studio, for example,
seniors Erin Hecker and Gary Soldati anchor the live &quot;Morning
Show,&quot; which broadcasts school news and announcements not
only to every classroom but also to cable TV viewers in five surrounding
towns. 'We've been doing this since eighth grade,&quot; Erin says,
adjusting her mike as junior Jeremy Van Deusen readies the camera
to roll. Kids hustle into their places for the spooky opening
Halloween skit, for the sportscast with videos of last night's
soccer victory, for an interview with a visitor to the school.
The show starts on time, a polished, professional production.
<P>
Because this school enrolls students by choice from many towns,
community-building within the school carries special importance.
In Kathy VanOrman's computer skills class, ninth-grader Jeremy
Turner dashes in with a digital camera, connects it to a terminal,
and pulls up on the screen the faces of<B> </B>twelve classmates
he has<B> </B>just snapped in the halls. 'We're putting together
a freshman<B> </B>yearbook,&quot; he says, &quot;with everyone's<B>
</B>names, faces, birthdays, interests - and what they would do
with a million dollars.&quot;
<H5>Time for True Involvement </H5>

<P>
A million dollars matters a lot in this district, whose voters
sent Mt. Everett's budget back to the drawing boards twice before
deep cuts and a groundswell of parent and student support finally
brought passage. Ever since the school began seriously restructuring
in 1988 under a multiyear Carnegie grant, its bold moves toward
deepening student learning have focused community attention on
the ways Mt. Everett differs from business as usual during the
school day. Joining the Coalition of Essential Schools put the
weight of a national reform movement behind changes already begun.
<P>
Mt. Everett's high school students, for example, take only three
courses per term, but each meets for 99 minutes long enough to
conduct a Socratic seminar, finish a scientific experiment, work
out a complex problem whose answer doesn't come easily. All ninth
graders also cycle through a four-quarter &quot;Tools of Learning&quot;
sequence of research and technology skills, including learning
how to use the library, the Internet, and the other computer resources
increasingly available to them.
<P>
The schedule caused controversy at first, prompting worries that
sequential subjects like math would suffer - and in fact, ninth
graders now take math daily all year to ensure continuity. But
the longer classes have allowed these students to try projects
once made impossible by the dictates of the bell.
<P>
In Bob Gauthier's American Government class, ninth graders sprawled
on the floor are testing out their own board games on issues like
the right to citizenship, or cruel and unusual punishment. One
group argues about why gender classification is deemed acceptable
in certain instances and not others. &quot;These things have been
decided so far in individual cases,' Alexis Batacchi explains.
&quot;It's not in the Constitution.&quot;
<P>
Another of Gauthier's classes does 99 minutes of community service
four times weekly in the local hospital, a nursing home, and a
facility for the exceptionally handicapped, and tutors Mt. Everett's
elementary students, who share the same campus.
<P>
Seventh and eighth graders follow a different schedule, but important
classes are rarely less than an hour in length, and grade-level
teaming allows for sustained projects that cross subject-area
lines. The whole eighth grade, for instance, took canoes down
the Housatonic to look through several disciplinary lenses at
how their own environment changes over time. From the mills of
the Industrial Revolution to pollution and economic problems,
they brought the interconnections of politics, literature, and
science very close to home. The unit culminated with students
taking sides in a formal debate on whether to allow a hydroelectric
plant to locate on the river.
<P>
In a six-week unit on 'theory formation,&quot; seventh graders
learn to examine evidence from historical and scientific sources.
Among other texts, they use actual records from the celebrated
1877 murder trial of a black Sheffield resident. &quot;We use
blood and guts as a way to study forensic evidence and teach kids
scientific facts about blood and fiber identification,&quot; says
teacher Bill Gillooly. &quot;But it's also a way to continue the
theme of power, which we've been exploring all year in other subject
areas.&quot;
<H5>A Common Purpose </H5>

<P>
Students and teachers at Mt. Everett now say that their learning
time is much more valuable than it once was. And as the community
makes more use of the school's expanded buildings, their informal
closer looks at what goes on here have fostered a new sense that
the citizenry agrees. In winter the school stays open late so
senior citizens can walk the halls for exercise. A local Equity
theater company stages its shows here, and runs a drama program
for students as part of the deal. A school day care center serves
staff, students, and residents. And parents, students, and teachers
work together on a Coalition of Essential Schools steering committee.
<P>
&quot;My daughter Chelsea is excited to be applying for a place
on the school council,&quot; says parent and council member Dek
Tillett, who has stopped by to see principal Glenn Devoti, &quot;She's
comfortable with adults. She knows from her experience here that
she can learn something. And she also knows she can make a difference.&quot;
<H5>Steady Improvement Follows Changes </H5>

<P>
From 1990 to 1993 University of Massachusetts researcher Dr. Gretchen
Rossman studied the effects of school restructuring on Mt. Everett's
students, and a researcher from the State University of New York
and Columbia University, Dr. Rose Rudnitski, followed with another
report in 1994. Much of their attention centered on whether Mt.
Everett's new long-block semester schedules improved student achievement
and engagement. In addition, Mt. Everett has documented statistics
on student achievement during the same period. Among the findings:
<UL>
<LI>Grades consistently improved and the number of students on
the honor still increased by as much as 30 percentage points per
class.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Scores on the 1995 California Achievement Tests were well
above national norms. Average SAT verbal scores jumped 43 points
from 1991 to 1994, exceeding the national average by 35 points.
Average American College Testing (ACT) composite scores also went
up, exceeding both the national and the state average.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>College acceptance rates went up from 63 percent to 71 percent.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Students, parents, and teachers agreed that studying three
major subjects in long blocks was better for student learning,
providing more varied and interesting learning opportunities.
Four years after the long blocks were introduced, a large majority
of students said they did not find them boring, and in fact were
going deeper into the subject area.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Teachers reported that they knew their students better, making
it easier to focus on individual students' strengths rather than
their weaknesses.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Attendance remained stable at around 94 percent.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The number of students visiting the library jumped dramatically,
decreasing only after computers made access to library materials
possible without leaving the classroom.<BR>

</H2>

<H3><EM>Students at this small reservation school work for a purpose--they
know their tribal culture's future depends partly on their involvement
and achievements. </EM></H3>

<P>
Richard Brough's history students were talking, and the scholars
gathered in the Albuquerque Hilton for the annual meeting of the
Society for Applied Anthropology were listening hard. These Zuni
students, from Twin Buttes High School had brought them new perspectives
on how native cultures receive those who come to study and record
their ways. In retelling the story of the 19th century ethnologist
Frank Hamilton Cushing's extended stay at the Zuni pueblo, they
became teachers themselves, taking power and dignity from their
position as the coming generation of tribal leaders.
<P>
Three hours' drive from Albuquerque through the stunning desert
landscape of red rock and mesas, this small alternative school
is helping young people turn their lives and their futures toward
a new vision. Most come to the low cinder-block building that
houses Twin Buttes because they resist the conventional high school
scene in Zuni, a reservation of 10,000 people that boasts the
nation's first Native American school district. They have little
academic success behind them; many already have children of their
own. But by graduation they have become active participants in
their own education, connected in direct and important ways to
their community's well-being.
<H5><B>School Work that Matters</B> </H5>

<P>
Like the American History class that presented Cushing's work
to the anthropological experts, students at this Essential school
come to expect their school work to matter to the outside world.
In the Southwest Studies class led by Craig Birrell and Richard
Brough, they document damage to ancient petroglyphs on nearby
outcroppings for archaeologists' records. By studying, the ruins
of ancient settlements they learn about their Paleo-Indian ancestors,
then teach that history, science, and folklore to Zuni's elementary
school students. They volunteer at the Zuni Museum, and are planning
a guide service for tourists. And they help write and publish
a new local newspaper called the <I>Shiwi Messenger,</I> which
has fast become a major forum for news and public expression.
<P>
&quot;We have so many archaeological and historic sites right
here,' says principal Linda Belarde, who helped start Twin Buttes
in 1983. &quot;Kids can go to the actual spot where Indians made
the first contact with Spaniards; they can climb up the steep
bluff of Dowa Yalanne Mountain, where the Zunis lived for twelve
years during the 17th century Pueblo Revolt.&quot; Learning from
such field experiences brings adventure into academic pursuits
like reading, writing, and analyzing data, she says. One class
travels yearly to the Grand Canyon to compare theories of origin
from myth and other students have won scholarships to Colorado's
prestigious Crow Canyon Field School.
<P>
Using a substantial settlement in a land claim against the government,
the tribe has developed a number of resource management programs,
and many Twin Buttes students now work in the field as interns
&quot;The Zuni Conservation Project uses the latest technology
as well as traditional techniques,' says science teacher Kate
Brown. &quot;It's a very rich environment for my students.&quot;
Students Malcolm Chavez and DeVonna Niiha, for example, helped
develop springs to attract bear and other wildlife. Allison Wallace
tracked coyote and deer, then graphed patterns to help officials
decide which areas to open for hunting.
<P>
To earn the service learning credit Twin Buttes requires for graduation,
other students have cleaned up the graffiti that mars the reservation's
public places, helped the Fish and Game Department restore picnic
areas and trails, worked on the reservation's research and rescue
team, and visited with the elderly in a home health care program.
&quot;I like to hear the old stories,&quot; says Antoinette Escobar,
who at first wanted to drop out of school when she became pregnant
but instead graduated in 1995 as salutatorian of her class.
<P>
After two years of academic foundering, Stephanie Kanteena, 18,
began working with tribal leaders last year to open a teen center.
After a summer spent helping the local museum create traditional
Zuni &quot;waffle gardens,&quot; she says, &quot;School isn't
boring anymore. I'm very happy with the classes I'm taking.&quot;
<H5><B>Dropouts Down, Scores Up</B> </H5>

<P>
Not only are Twin Buttes students learning more and better, but
their enjoyment makes learning a habit they wan to continue after
graduation. Dropping out of high school has been a pervasive problem
on this reservation, where close to half of the students failed
to finish as recently as the 1980's. But since 1991, when Twin
Buttes first began adopting Essential School beliefs, this school's
dropout rate has decreased from 36 to 16 percent. &quot;If we
can get them to the middle of the tenth grade year, we can usually
keep them, says Linda Belarde.
<P>
Indeed, in the last few years students' state achievement test
scores in reading, writing, and math have leapt considerably between
eleventh and twelfth grades. All the school's sophomores pass
the state's reading and writing competency exams, and all its
seniors graduate with a high school diploma (not a &quot;certificate
of attendance&quot;).
<P>
The Essential School principle calling for a &quot;tone of decency&quot;
drives much of the school's emphasis on attendance. &quot;Our
biggest problem is kids who ditch school after showing up for
half a day,&quot; Belarde says. &quot;Obviously, creating programs
that pull and interest them is one solution.&quot; Gang activity
and violence are not problems at the school and although drug
and alcohol abuse is pervasive in the community, Belarde says,
&quot;this year we have had only a few complaints here at school.&quot;
<P>
Students who have babies are encouraged to continue in school,
and 15 young mothers at Twin Buttes bring their infants to the
school's day care center and help with child while they work toward
graduation. &quot;Some of our highest achieving students are teen
parents who are able to stay in school,&quot; observes Belarde.
<P>
The path toward college and career is often unconventional as
well, yet Twin Buttes seems to lay a solid basis for continuing
an education eventually. &quot;Many of our graduates start at
the state university in Gallup and then take some time at home,&quot;
Belarde says. &quot;Later they go to work or start job training,
either in Gallup or in the extension program here at Zuni.&quot;
Twin Buttes's wing of its building adjoins the University of New
Mexico's extension school and construction technology program,
the Zuni Wellness Center, an arts cooperative that grew out of
a Twin Buttes art class, and adult education classes-ample evidence
that there is life after high school.
<P>
Twin Buttes makes a particular effort to form bonds between adults
and young people that transcend the teacher-student role. The
whole school participated, for instance, in a challenge activity
where mostly blindfolded teachers and students traversed a perilous
canyon with only each other as guides. The trip could be seen
as metaphor; these students choose risk and new direction every
day in their education here. And every day, it seems, they also
give something back enriching their lives, and their community,
well beyond graduation.
<H5><B>Quality of Education Brings Awards to Twin Buttes</B> 
</H5>

<UL>
<LI>In its eighth year, the school's award-winning Healthy Children
day care program uses Federal, state, and district funds to help
pregnant teen-agers stay in school. (New Mexico leads the nation
in the percentage of teen births, and this county leads the state.)
Mini-buses transport the young mothers and children to school;
the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutrition program contributes
a healthy start; and young parents and relatives help with day
care, learning home economics skills and sharing the lunch hour
with their youngsters.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>In a self-contained classroom for students with severe physical
and mental impairments, Twin Buttes began an award-winning special
education program to prepare participants for employment. The
program expanded to become a major community resource, including
a sheltered workshop and transition program and Zuni Entrepreneurial
Enterprises, which provides recycling, public transportation,
and food concessions at the local hospital.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>One student service learning project developed into a greenhouse
now being built on the Twin Buttes grounds. Students designed
the greenhouse and wrote a proposal for its construction; a grant
from the state's Indian Education Center for Excellence provided
help with supplies, materials, and instruction.

<H3><EM>Students in this urban middle school are readying themselves
to deal thoughtfully and decently with the diverse, impersonal,
and sometimes violent world ahead. </EM></H3>

<P>
Lana Gold's Humanities class at the Academy for the Middle Years
(AMY) starts the morning wired, in the way that only a roomful
of sixth and seventh graders can be. As they pop up and down chattering
from their circle of desks, it's hard to imagine them maintaining
order at all, much less handling the young adult literature on
the blackboard's assignment list. But when their classmate Jentia
Small, 12, takes over as facilitator at a signal from the teacher,
they fall attentively silent. For the next hour, this diverse
group of kids from neighborhoods all over Philadelphia will talk
about what they are experiencing, reading, and writing with a
passion that shows the deep links this Essential school has forged
between students' lives and the world of learning.
<P>
A hush greets one young writer as she reads a description of her
fearsome grandfather, who scowls at her friends and squashes roaches
mercilessly with bare, bunioned feet. Is it all right to be &quot;nasty,&quot;
her classmates debate among themselves, when you're trying to
write about reality? Later, Carmen Williams interrupts to ask
urgently, 'Do souls ever die?&quot;
<P>
These are children who speak casually about life in the urban
danger zone: youngsters shot dead by random gunfire, fragmented
families, addicts on corners. They listen to each other's writing
and give back their questions with utter attention and respect.
And many of them ride school buses an hour and a half each way
to be in a school where that is possible. 'My neighborhood school
is trouble,&quot; Carmen says, to explain the grueling commute.
&quot;Here I have my friends.'
<P>
AMY works hard to establish its tone of decency; students meet
weekly in small groups for social and academic guidance, and disciplinary
suspensions are rare. The Philadelphia Inquirer has cited the
school as one of four middle schools in the city with a nonviolent
atmosphere; daily attendance averages 93 percent.
<P>
AMY has no academic entrance requirements; as a magnet school
in the city's desegregation effort, it admits students by lottery
to reflect the city's racial composition. Started by parents in
the mid-1970s as a public alternatives to neighborhood middle
schools, the school has moved four times in the last decade. The
current location, on a former college campus in the city's residential
northwest Mt. Airy section, is still not secure from reassignment.
<P>
Yet despite frequent upheavals, families, students, and faculty
here remain fiercely attached to their school. Principal Hofly
Perry can only remember one student in eleven years who voluntarily
withdrew, and even in the face of early retirement incentives,
only one teacher position has opened in the last several years.
A vigorous Home and School Association explicitly aims to support
the implementation of Essential School ideas and to offer continual
feedback and support. The president of that group, Linnie Jones,
has sent a son and a granddaughter to AMY.
<H5><B>Preparing for Choices Ahead</B> </H5>

<P>
Jones, in fact, was among a group of students, parents, and alumni
who took part in an unusual ethnographic study of the school over
the last several years. Working with researchers from the University
of Pennsylvania and the nonprofit group Research for Action, they
conducted focus groups and interviews, analyzed transcripts, and
shadowed students through the school day, collecting qualitative
data on how well the school prepared its graduates for what lay
ahead.
<P>
In ninth grade, for example, almost all AMY graduates attend the
high schools of their choice-typically either the smaller, more
demanding academic or performing arts magnet schools, or small
learning communities within the city's comprehensive high schools.
The research project's alumni focus groups, which were balanced
by gender, race, and previous achievement, revealed that students
went on to cope extraordinarily well with the challenges of city
high schools and, eventually, college.
<P>
&quot;They know how to work with peers from many different neighborhoods
and cultures,' says Perry. &quot;They can handle potentially violent
situations in nonviolent ways. They don't like the impersonal
style of a big high school, but they know how to get around it
in a mature way.&quot; One returning graduate told Perry, years
later, that only after she got to college did her AMY education
bear the most fruit. &quot;We help them find their voice,&quot;
observes Lana Gold.
<H5><B>Setting Shared Standards</B> </H5>

<P>
The school's insistence that student voices be heard shows up
equally in the classrooms. &quot;If we let kids into the conversation
about what good work looks like,' says Holly Perry, &quot;they
start to internalize high standards.&quot; AMY keeps track of
student progress using performance rubrics and narrative evaluations,
with results evident in every class.
<P>
In Gene Campher's social studies class, students prepare reports
on what their own lives would be like if they lived in a particular
province of Canada, then create brochures presenting various regions.
But first, they help come up with a rubric that identifies the
qualities of good work from previous projects. By the time they
complete the Canada project, they have assessed their own work
and that of their peers, and the teacher has added his own ratings
and comments. Expectations are specific and concrete, so these
students learn just how their work could improve.
<P>
Science teacher Katie Myles hands back portfolios filled with
a term's work to a class teeming with excitement. Every piece
in the folder has a rubric attached, assessing everything from
written and oral presentation to class behavior and work habits.
'It's worth the extra time when you see the children realize what
it takes to do well,&quot; she says. &quot;They stop believing
you're taking away something they deserve, and start to work for
it.&quot;
<P>
Classes put a high value on thoughtfulness, often using Socratic
seminars and follow-up writing to encourage deeper levels of discourse.
At his computer terminal in Chris O'Neill's class, Anthony Minnick
pecks out his opinion of Ron Mitchell, a Bucks County student
who took his school to court when it objected to his spiky punk
hair style. &quot;Well, he has a right to have his hair,' Anthony
says. &quot;It's freedom of speech; the Constitution says so.&quot;
Still, the school's arguments about safety sway him in the other
direction. He stares at the screen, torn between two points of
view. &quot;I think he has to change the hair,&quot; he finally
says.
<P>
In the small library, media specialist Janet Malloy puts up students'
timelines of their personal histories. A generalist, she often
helps with classroom projects and conducts Socratic seminars with
students. AMY has no &quot;outsiders'; all teachers, including
special education staff, work on teams with around 80 students,
and kids are mixed in vertical age groups that fully include those
with learning differences.
<P>
Around two each afternoon, an eerie silence descends on AMY's
halls, when everyone in the school stops for 35 minutes of sustained
silent reading. The cauldron of energy subsides; something profound
and palpable stirs in the air instead. The next idea, the next
day, the next generation is taking shape; and everyone here has
a part to play in it.
<H5><B>A Sense of Community Shows Academic Results</B> </H5>

<P>
&#183; Attendance holds steady at 93 percent, even though many
students must travel well over an hour to get to school. On one
recent early-release day, attendance was 98 percent.
<P>
&#183; The local press has called AMY one of the city's safest
middle schools, with the lowest incidence of disciplinary referrals
and suspensions.
<P>
&#183; At an average of 22 students, class size is far smaller
than in the typical city school. All of AMY's special education
students are included in regular classrooms, which allows special
Ed teachers to become full partners with the school's teaching
teams, often contributing special expertise in areas like computers
or expressive arts.
<P>
&#183; Since the daily 35-minute Sustained Silent Reading (SSR)
period began in 1994, scores on the Gates-McGinitie Reading Level
Inventory test increased by at least one grade level in 58 percent
of sixth- andseventh-grade students, and over a quarter of those
jumped between two and four grade levels. Thirty-two percent of
eighth-graders' scores went up a grade level, with almost ten
percent of those jumping several levels.
<P>
&#183; On citywide reading tests, AMY students consistently score
better than students in other Philadelphia schools.

<H2><EM>A frustrating past counts less than one's future at this
small school where students undertake a lean and deep integrated
curriculum in a climate of unanxious expectation.</EM></H2>

<P>
It's no accident that the Crefeld School<B> </B>in Philadelphia
feels so much like someone's home, with the intimate nooks and
crannies, stairways and sitting rooms of this one-time family
estate converted to serve fewer than a hundred students in grades
seven through twelve. The commitment to individual learning here
has created a place that is as much family as school, and virtually
every expectation for students reflects a mix of high hopes and
trust.
<P>
Since it began in 1970 as a small alternative school in a well-off
section of the city, Crefeld has gone through several crises of
identity and leadership. But the last several years have seen
it narrow and deepen its purpose and methods, guided by Essential
School principles and by the compelling needs of its students.
<P>
&quot;Most of our kids have been somehow left in the dust by traditional
systems,&quot; says headmaster Michael Patron, who estimates that
85 percent of Crefeld students &quot;learn differently&quot; from
the norm. Over a quarter have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit
Disorder; four out of five bring failing grades from previous
schools. &quot;Sometimes they're just following a different drummer,&quot;
Patron says. &quot;But their emotional problems are usually school-related.&quot;
<P>
At Crefeld they encounter a new system that puts less emphasis
on convention and more on coming to understanding in whatever
ways work best for a particular student. The same teacher-adviser
provides academic and personal guidance throughout each student's
career, helping with everything from coursework to college plans.
Class size averages eight students. And though students must do
considerable reading, writing, and thinking here, Crefeld organizes
curriculum simply, to be as responsive as possible to a student's
individual needs.
<P>
Intensive semester-long courses in Humanities and Sciences, integrated
across several disciplines, spiral through content areas in consecutive
years (so that all students take, for example, American Studies
in the same year). Math, Spanish, arts, and elective courses take
up the afternoon; and everyone gives two hours a week of service
to the community.
<P>
Yet much of this work gets done in an informal, almost home-like
manner at Crefeld. 'If I can't deal with something I can get up
and walk around the building, calm down and get focused,&quot;
says senior Tony Angelo. &quot;The teachers treat you more as
an adult - more freedom, but more responsibility too.' An advanced
calculus student, Tony tutors algebra daily to a Crefeld midddle-schooler
who is ahead of her class, and twice a week he and six schoolmates
travel to the central city to help younger kids with math.
<H5><B>Graduation by Perfomance</B></H5>

<P>
The school keeps track of student progress in equally individual
ways. In portfolios each year, students must assemble examples
of literary analysis, research, and writing, and show proficiency
in an expressive form other than written English prose (such as
visual art or computer programming). They reflect in writing on
their own lives, goals, and learning styles. And they conduct
a formal scientific study of a topic that concerns the community,
then present a report or proposal to an agency with power to effect
change on the issue. A student qualifies for graduation when he
or she presents a portfolio of exhibitions demonstrating mastery
in each of these categories, and passes a dozen or so tests of
competency the school devised. (See sidebar, page 2.)
<P>
Within this pragmatic yet flexible structure, students seem to
take new interest in their work. &quot;I get to learn at a pace
which I can do well, a method of learning that better suits my
needs,&quot; one student reflected in writing. &quot;If I learned
everything they taught me at [my previous school] yes, I would
learn more. But here I <I>understand </I>much more.&quot;
<P>
One senior describes with pride his research project on the Pennsylvania
Dutch healer known as Mountain Mary. A local history enthusiast,
he is severely dyslexic, but Crefeld's less lock-step style works
well for him, he says. &quot;If trust and relationships come first,
then I can learn in my own style,&quot; he says.
<P>
&quot;This place is full of passion,&quot; says classmate Dana
Witengier, an aspiring actress who spends every afternoon at the
Philadelphia Youth Theater. &quot;In history we're really thinking
about stuff, and then you go do something else and think about
it more. Even when you're not in school your head's in it.&quot;
<P>
Another 17-year-old girl, ticking off a succession of behavioral
low points in her past few years, smiles serenely as she describes
the difference Crefeld made for her. &quot;The teachers are on
the kids' side,&quot; she says. &quot;How you learn is individual;
they're teaching me about myself. So I've grown more open - I
can be involved, form opinions, be a leader in the class. I'm
amazed how much I've changed.&quot;
<H5><B>Turning Toward Success</B></H5>

<P>
Crefeld's approach reflects Theodore Sizer's Essential School
principle of &quot;unanxious expectation,&quot; and a dramatic
rise in student achievement results. Of those who enter Crefeld
as chronic truants, 90 percent show up here every day. Of those
who arrive with failing grades, 90 percent make grades of C and
above. Only one in ten students does not stay to graduate, and
only 2 percent drop out.
<P>
Classes are so small that rates of college attendance vary considerably,
but 90 percent of the 1996 seniors plan to pursue their studies,
and their average SAT score is 1080. Crefeld graduates have gone
on to places as various as Brown, Penn, Clark, Hofstra, Boston
University, the University of Maine, Hampshire College, and Berkeley
School of Music.
<P>
But even this impressive data fails to convey the flavor of this
school - warm, familial, even its air of slight disorder conveying
a quirky intelligence. &quot;Crefeld saved my life,&quot; one
student wrote. 'I've finally found a place where I can learn and
be happy.&quot; Another observed, &quot;It's a place to find yourself,
be an individual, learn without lectures ... and spread your wings.&quot;
From newly strong students who once hated school, these are strong
words, backed up by academic performance and by their newfound
confidence.
<H5><B>Some Things Crefeld Seniors Must Know and Do</B></H5>

<P>
As well as compiling a graduation portfolio, Crefeld seniors must
pass (with a 90 percent rating by a faculty team) more than a
dozen competency exams the school has designed to assure essential
competence (not comprehensive knowledge) in areas ranging from
math and science to foreign language. Some tests are written and
some oral; some allow the use of notes. The format and content
of these exams are openly know, though specific details vary from
year to year. Some examples:
<UL>
<LI><B>World Geography and Countries.</B> Choose two countries
on which to become an expert ( including the United States; no
more than one per continent). Be prepared to answer questions
about the country's geography, history, culture, and government.
You will have an oral exam of about 20 questions; you may use
your own notes but not outside sources to answer.
<LI><B>American Government and Constitution. </B>Be prepared to
answer ten specific questions about our government and the rights
of citizens, based on information contained in the Constitution.
You will have a fifteen-minute written exam on which you may use
a copy of the Constitution.
<LI><B>Scientific Article Analysis. </B>You will be asked to read
an assigned scientific research article and write an analysis
of the experimental method used by the researchers in the article.
No notes may be used.
<LI><B>Argumentative Essay. </B>You will be asked to write an
argumentative essay on an assigned question which requires minimal
factual knowledge (e.g., Should the drinking age be lowered to
18? Should women be drafted?
<LI><B>Home Medical Care. </B>You only have room in your medicine
cabinet for ten items. Decide the ten most important items to
include and why. In an oral presentation, you will be given three
scenarios of home health care emergencies to apply your first
aid knowledge using the supplies you have chosen for your medicine
cabinet.
<LI><B>Drugs and Substance Abuse. </B>What ten facts about drug
education should every high school graduate know before he or
she graduates? Be prepared to defend your answer orally.
<LI><B>Sex Education. </B>What ten facts about sex education (reproduction,
contraception, sexually transmitted diseases) should every high
school graduate know before he or she graduates? Be prepared to
defend your answer orally.
<LI><B>Nutrition and Dietary Analysis. </B>Keep a journal of what
you eat for a week and do a nutritional analysis of it. Make recommendations
on how to improve it; provide information on calories, protein,
carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Your answers will
be written.

<html><head><title>CES: Background: The Coalition Approach to School Change</title></head><body><h1><center>The Coalition Approach to School Change: An Introduction</center></h1>No two good schools are ever quite alike. A good school is the special creation of its own community -- its teachers and students, parents, counselors and administrators. There is no such thing as a distinct, detailed blueprint or model for a fine school. There is no concrete prescription for a good school which can be applied to bring success to any other school. <p>However, good schools do share powerful guiding ideas, principles that are widely accepted even as they take different shapes in practice when people put them to work in their own settings from day to day. It is these shared ideas of what makes good schools that undergirds the Coalition of Essential Schools. The Coaliton is our nation's largest and farthest-reaching school reform effort, and its nine Common Principles serve as guidelines for schools that want to rethink their approach to teaching and learning. Though each Coalition school devises its own individual structures and practices, they share in common the principles they work to apply.<p>The Coalition of Essential Schools was born out of the research of educator and school reform leader Theodore R. Sizer. He distilled the findings of his Study of High Schools (1979-84) into five imperatives for better schools, fleshed out in Sizer's book, Horace's Compromise: The Dilemma of the American High School (Houghton Mifflin, 1984). In 1984, the Coalition was established at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and 12 schools took up the challenge of putting Sizer's ideas into practice to become the first Essential Schools. Drawing on their experiences, Sizer expanded his imperatives for better schools and developed what is now the Coalition's nine Common Principles.<p>Initially, Sizer and his staff worked closely and directly in a mentoring relationship with Coalition member schools to help them navigate the redesign process. The national cry for a better system of education led other schools to explore the Essential School approach until, by 1988, the Coalition's small, university-based staff was reaching out to work with 55 different schools across the country. However, as Coalition membership continued not only to grow, but to diversify across the United States, the Coalition restructured and regionalized its support for schools in the redesign process. <p>Today, Essential School activity in some locales has matured to a level of autonomy. As they witness the successes of others, and as educational reform in general continues to be a national priority, more and more schools are exploring the Coalition. To give these fledglings the support they need, the Coalition is organizing resource centers where experienced practitioners-in-the-field and veteran member schools might work together to support others in their locales.<p>As direct support for Essential Schools becomes regionalized and redistributed among members, the role of the Coalition at Brown is shifting from mentor to facilitator. The work is proceeding alongseveral avenues designed to support the Essential School reform effort in its entirety:<p><dl>	<dd>Explore the concepts about school change and the Coalition's nine Common Principles through research projects which position the Coalition at the fault-line between theory and practice.<p>	<dd>Facilitate reform by focusing effort on those places which show the most promise of serving as both helpmates and examples for others.<p>	<dd>Invest in people who will build the capacity of the Coalition to support school reform via local and regional efforts, particularly through development of the Coalition's corps of practitioners-in-the-field.<p>	<dd>Challenge policymakers to create a climate which favors school change by bringing the work of Essential Schools beyond the classroom and introducing it to members of the larger community.<p>	<dd>Influence the national discourse about school change by continuing to explore the issues of Essential School reform and communicate them via the media and publications which link the Coalition of Essential Schools to its members and to the public.</dl><p><hr><a href = "backgrou.htm">Return to the Background page</a><br></body></html>

<html><head><title>CES: Membership: General Criteria for Membership</title></head><body bgcolor=#ffffff><hr><h1><center>General  Criteria For Membership</center></h1><p><hr>Inquiries from interested schools are welcome. Memberschools in the Coalition are selected with the followingcriteria in mind:<ol><li><b>Diversity is important</b>:  The Coalition will beenriched by the association of differing schools-urban, suburban and rural; public, independentand parochial; east, west, south and north; smalland large; with a variety of student bodies andcommunities. This diversity will strengthen thevalidity of those aspects of our work whichappear to succeed.<p><li><b>Agreement with the Common Principles</b> of theCoalition must be unequivocally demonstrated by   the faculty of the school. This does not mean thatthese Principles are not changeable over time;indeed, the Coalition schools' experimentationwill surely lead to adaptations. Nor does it meanthat schools have to emphasize all equally.What it does mean, however, is that there is asecure, if simple, common platform upon which ourpartnership rests.<p><li> <b>Moral, professional and financial support</b> is acrucial prerequisite to proceeding with theinevitably difficult work that flows from theCommon Principles. Again, nothing is perfectlysure in this life; governing boards change, moneydries up or becomes available, leaders depart andothers arrive. Yet we seek as firm and specific acommitment from governing authorities as isfeasible and for blocks of years rather than oneyear at a time.<p><li><b>Committed leaders and staffs</b> at each schoolare essential to the success of this endeavor -people interested in the project and, if skeptical,constructively so. Reluctant folk make pooradventurers.<p><li>  <b>The school agrees to share information</b> aboutits work with the Central Staff, otherCoalition schools, and interested visitors.This conversation is vital to our efforts; thereforeit is important to maintain sustained communi-cation. Member schools send the Central Staffinformation about the progress of their Essentialprogram which may include the following: theschool schedule, minutes from meetings whereCoalition matters were discussed, sample lessons,examples of exhibitions of mastery.<p><li>  <b>The school agrees to undergo a self-evaluation</b>every three years, which will include hostinga visiting committee.The school will provide for travel and lodging fora small visiting committee for a few days. Also,the school will allow for members of its own staffto travel to other schools as part of a visitingcommittee. The Central Staff as well as ourmember schools feel that such visits are vital inorder for a meaningful dialogue to take place bothwithin the school, and between the school andthe Central Staff.<p><li>  The school must demonstrate that it hasincluded <b>sufficient funds in its budget</b> for staffdevelopment and planning within the school,evaluation team visits, and travel expensesincurred for participation at Coalitionactivities.The school needs to show that it will be able tofund Coalition activities, particularly thoseexpenses associated with attendance at symposiaand workshops. Such costs will include travel,room, board, and conference fees. Symposia andworkshops are self-supporting. Fees will reflectthe actual costs of developing these conferences.<p></ol>For additional information, please contact:<br>Coalition of Essential Schools<br>Box 1969, Brown University<br>Providence, RI  02912<p><hr><p><a href = "membersh.htm">Return to the Membership page</a><p></body></html>

In addition to memberschools, the Coalition recognizes "planning stage" schoolsand "exploring stage" schools.<p>The Coalition offers no specific "model" or program forschools to adopt. What Essential schools hold in common isthe nine principles which focus each school's effort torethink its priorities and redesign its structures andpractices. Each school develops its own programs, suited toits particular students, faculty and community - hence, notwo Essential schools are alike. The member schools serve asexamples of a variety of thoughtfully redesigned schools.<p>Schools applying to the Coalition must present a plan forchange consistent with the Common Principles and mustdemonstrate faculty and governing board support forextending the plan to the entire school. There is no fee tojoin the Coalition; however, most schools require at least$50,000 a year for three to five years during the initialstudy and redesign phases for release time, travel andprofessional development activities. Schools are responsiblefor securing their own funds.<p>The Coalition creates professional development activitiesand programsspecifically for planning and member school faculties androutinely shares results of its research findings with theschools.<p>For additional information, please contact:<br>Coalition of Essential Schools<br>Box 1969, Brown University<br>Providence, RI  02912<p><hr><p><a href = "membersh.htm">Return to the Membership page</a><p></body></html>

Getting to a clear answer is thenecessary first step in rethinking a school's curriculum. But to commit oneself,as Essential Schools do, to the idea that the goal of education is to getstudents to use their minds well is to take the deceptively simple first step inrethinking our entire system of education.<p>   Evidence of how difficult this proves is apparent even among the Coalition ofEssential Schools. The governing metaphor of student as worker is accepted amongall Essential Schools. But few are taking the necessary and frightening nextstep--to redesign the entire curriculum around thorough coverage of fewer areas,rather than offering an array of courses aimed to attract students for whomvastly different expectations are held.  Why this should be so is a fascinatingand deeply political question, best explored by looking, in theory and inpractice, at what that student-worker is doing in the Essential Schoolclassroom.<p><hr><h2>Authentic Work</h2><hr>What, for instance, does it mean for a student to "work" in such a class?Clearly it does not mean to take assiduous notes as a teacher deliversinstruction from the front of the room. The fifth of the common principlesCoalition schools embrace suggests that teachers, instead, act as coaches--"toprovoke students to learn how to learn, and thus to teach themselves." This kindof "authentic" student work is active and collaborative; it has evident valueand clear goals, and it generates more ideas, connections, and challenges themore it is pursued.<p>   Authentic work, says Coalition research scholar Grant Wiggins, who hasstudied the pedagogy of Essential Schools, meets these and other very specificstandards. When students are really workers, Wiggins says, they can alwaysanswer certain questions--about the task's purpose, about the resources needed tocarry it out, about what it means to do the task well. They can grasp what isessential about the task, set priorities, make intelligent judgments. Ideally,this is true not only at the level of a particular assignment, but also whenapplied to all the courses in a curriculum, taken together. Students shouldemerge from their high school career with an integrated vision of <i>how to think</i>within the culture, which implies a broad understanding, not just narrow or roteexpertise.<p>   This way of looking at work contrasts directly with the traditional pedagogyof American secondary education. For a century high schools have asked studentsto memorize facts and answers in carefully distinct fields of study; andteachers have been under pressure to design courses that cover aspecific chronological sequence of material. This emphasis on coverage in thecurriculum inevitably focuses attention not on how to learn or think, but onwhat facts one "needs" to know, presented once only in a linear "run" throughfour years of school. But what one "needs" to know depends, as David Cohenforcefully argues in <i>The Shopping Mall High School</i>, on what one's future role inthe social structure is seen to be. The fragmentation of the curriculum intosubjects, levels, and purposes that will appeal to every student reflects thehistorical role of American high schools less as centers of learning than asholding places for people whose place in the social and economic structure isnot yet ready for them. Except for a few at the top, whether or not our studentslearn to think has not been the point at all.<p><hr><h2>Questions, Not Answers</h2><hr>The alternative, to adopt thoroughness in place of coverage as the guidingprinciple of a curriculum, rests on the Coalition's conviction that everystudent can come to think critically. But where might an individual teacherbegin? The starting point, as Grant Wiggins argues, is to "organize courses notaround  'answers' but around questions and problems to which 'content'represents answers." Such "essential questions," as they are known, are animportant ingredient of curriculum reform as the Coalition of Essential Schoolssees it. On every level--from the most encompassing, school-wide questions to thespecific question posed in a particular unit of a particular course--the"essential question" should shape the way students learn to think critically forthemselves.<p>   At Central Park East Secondary School in New York City, for example, theentire curriculum is focused on getting students to ask and answer questionslike these: "From whose viewpoint are we seeing or reading or hearing? How do weknow what we know? How are things, events, and people connected to each other?What in this idea is new and what old? Why does this matter?" (See Figure 1.)When they are applied at the course level, such questions consistently engagestudents in what Benjamin Bloom calls "higher order thinking"--analyzing,synthesizing, and evaluating evidence they gather themselves.<p>   For example, a Central Park East U.S. history class focusing on immigrationcenters around a more specific "higher-level" essential question: "Whose countryis this, anyway?" That question shapes the materials and activities that willguide student research into smaller, unit-level questions, like "What factorsmotivated people to uproot themselves and come to this country?" or "Are thereethnic differences in these factors?" By exploring the political, economic, andsocial forces that shaped American immigration from its beginning--and by askingat every point the guiding "school-wide" questions--students gain a criticalunderstanding of the content of U.S. history, rather than memorizing a set offacts or someone else's interpretation of what those facts mean.<p>   Unit-level questions serve as what Grant Wiggins calls "entry points" tolarger questions that can go to the heart of a discipline. Because they takeshape as projects, case studies, or simulations, they get students under wayquickly, making inquiries that lead to the essential facts and theories thecourse will cover. And they evoke these abstract and complex issues in aconcrete setting with which students are already familiar.<p>   Teachers throughout the Coalition are coming up with questions like this, toserve as entry points in every discipline. CES's Assistant Director for Schools,Amy Gerstein, has a file full of examples teachers have developed, often in thesummer workshops the Coalition sponsors. Teacher Priscilla Winn Barlow, forinstance, asks students in a botany unit the essential question, "What is life,growth, 'natural' development? What factors most influence healthy development?"(See Figure 2.) Her entry-point questions are more specific, such as: "Do stemsof germinating seedlings always grow upwards and roots downwards?" To answerthis last, students must devise an experiment, and eventually come on their ownto a definition of what tropism is. The unit continues with questions designedto evaluate what environmental factors plants respond to, and how.<p>   In the example above, the "essential question" about growth is undeniably ahigher-level question. To answer it, students must combine information they findin books with information they acquire through their own experimentation.Because they must come up with their own hypotheses to test, they also gainimportant skills in creating experimental situations that allow them to reasonfrom observation.<p>   Such entry points can lead directly towards key unifying theories at the verycenter of math or science. For instance, first-year algebra students could learnto factor polynomials by discovering the relationship between multiplication andfactorization through a series of entry-point questions. (See Figure 3.) "Givena quadratic polynomial," workshop participant Robert Cornell asks, "can you findwhether it can be rewritten in factored form by actually finding the factoredform?" After students come up with techniques to do this, Cornell asks an evenmore pointed question: "When a polynomial is rewritten into factored form, whatfacts do you know about the polynomial that you didn't know before?" At itsessence, this question leads to what mathematicians and scientists must strugglewith at the highest level: whether or not two apparently different phenomenareflect the same deep fact about the world.<p>   Asking questions as a way of organizing content also serves to strengthenstudents' sense of their own authority over the content. Through their work theybecome experts on one aspect of a problem, and learn to collaborate with otherstudents in the exchange of important facts. This "jigsaw approach" is describedin the unit on AIDS developed by Grace Taylor at Brown University (see Figure4). Noteworthy in this assignment is the extent to which discipline lines mustbe crossed to master the material, and the fact that different kinds ofintellectual skills are developed. In the process of doing their research thestudents will learn about social studies issues, and also about importantbiology matters like contagion and the nature of viruses. But they will also bemastering the more general skill of critically analyzing the various texts theyuse.<p>   To do well in a unit called "Homo-Insectivorous and the Dilemma of WorldHunger" developed at one summer workshop by teachers Sandy Ohlerich, DanaMinoya, and Kent Vierot (Figure 5), students must also master such collaborativeskills. As well, while they research whether eating insects could be a solutionto world hunger students must become familiar with content in a range ofdisciplines from political economics to biology, entomology, and humannutrition. Finally, they must learn something about speech and rhetoric toprepare a persuasive presentation to the class.<p>   Each entry point question will have its own specific ways it encouragesstudents to use their minds well. Some questions will tilt in the direction ofcontent mastery, others towards the development of higher-order thinking skillslike deductive reasoning. By actively carrying out such assignments students arelearning different kinds and levels of intellectual skills all at once.<p><hr><h2>The Teacher's Role</h2><hr>It's easy to see how a question-centered approach could radically change the waya teacher designs a particular course. Rather than moving from point A to pointZ, the teacher encourages students to learn key skills through which content canbe revealed. "Instead of merely 'covering' material, students UNcover andREcover important ideas in context," says Grant Wiggins. "No essential idea,fact, theory, or application can be learned by doing something ONCE." Wigginscompares such learning to the ways in which ball players or musicians mastertheir skills--they learn new rules and strategies as they need them, not in"logical" order; and they make such essential skills habitual by practicing themagain and again.<p>   If the analogy is carried further, the teacher's role as coach becomes evenclearer--to make herself gradually obsolete as students learn to solve problemsfor themselves. This attitude extends also to the textbook, which the studentlearns to use as an intellectual resource for research, not a program to berigidly followed in sequence.<p>   Most Essential Schools, CES's Director for Schools Bob McCarthy says, arealready well on their way to shaping course work around such essentialquestions. In the classroom with the door shut, an individual teacher can oftenmake these fundamental changes in approach without anyone even noticing. But itisn't long before new pedagogy begins to rub up against the structure of thetraditionally designed curriculum. Special-topic courses-trigonometry, forinstance, or economics, or American literature-may be too confining for thequestion-centered logic of Essential School pedagogy; if essential questions areposed within them, what students need to learn will necessarily reach far beyondthe conventional limits of the course. At this point, if teachers are notactively sharing this approach among themselves and if the overall schoolcurriculum does not reflect it, trouble can start to brew.<p><hr><h2>What About Assessment?</h2><hr>The matter of assessment is the first to present itself. The conventionalcurriculum is closely tied to standard measures of what it means to do well inour society--competency tests, SAT scores, college acceptance, and more. If aschool is in desperate academic straits--low scores, high drop-out rates, fewgoing on to college--it might well consider a wholesale shift in its curriculumto reflect more thorough coverage of fewer areas. A school like this has littleto lose and everything to gain by teaching students to use their minds well.<p>   But what of a more conventionally successful school, where "all the tests"show that students are doing just fine, and whose students often gain admissionto the most prestigious colleges? What incentive does such a school have toreexamine its curriculum and methods? The problem here, Coalition chairman TedSizer points out, is that few of those tests are designed to measure criticalthinking. "The fact is that most 'successful' students can't stand up to twoSocratic questions in a row," he says.  And it is common knowledge amongprofessors at even the "best colleges" that students coming into them haveserious weaknesses in their ability to think critically or creatively.<p>   The inadequacy and even harm of test-based criteria of educational success isfurther borne out, Sizer notes, by the epidemic of cheating most high schoolsnationwide are experiencing. If to succeed in school means to do well on suchtests, a student can succeed on everyone's agreed terms not by thinking well butby outsmarting the tests--by either memorization or cheating, or both. The entirecurriculum is designed to meet the standards measured by those tests--so astudent can progress through four years of high school and go on to collegewithout ever being required to demonstrate that he can use his mind well.<p>   In fact, most schools remain wedded to the assumption that the mere passageof four years' time is the governing principle behind the curriculum. Thatassumption, Sizer says, is "bureaucratically useful," but ill-defined andindefensible. The ideal curriculum, he says, is like a trip the student takes,going at different speeds during different periods. Students leave school onlywhen they arrive at the end of the trip--by demonstrating mastery in the form ofa final exhibition.<p>   It is worth looking at what goals the standard high school curriculum doesserve. Historically, as <i>The Shopping Mall High School</i> points out, thinking wellhas almost never been one of high school's aims. Our current curriculum,instead, results directly from explicit social and economic policies over thepast hundred years, aimed to keep young people out of the job market and off thestreets. Based on a deep cynicism about who CAN learn to think, our educationalsystem defines success in different ways depending on who you are. For some,success in high school will simply equal not getting into trouble before theyfinish.<p>   The standard curriculum is perfectly matched to those often unarticulatedgoals. Courses form a kind of checklist--two years of math, three years ofEnglish, one year of history--that students tick off as time goes by. A widerange of course options is available to "shop" from, and students are trackedinto the ones that will fit their future station in life. Teachers and studentsagree implicitly that subject mastery is less important than getting through onecourse and on to another, so course expectations are set accordingly low. Not bycoincidence, teacher training reflects the same values--potential teachers rarelyhave true mastery of their subjects, and the methods they learn rely heavily ontextbook-driven pedagogy.<p>   For a school to decide it wants to abandon these goals, and move instead toanother vision of teaching <i>all</i> its students to use their minds well, has deeppolitical consequences. It is threatening to teachers, who must give up thinkingof themselves as deliverers of information; and it threatens the assumptionsthat underpin the socio-economic stratification of our society. Little wonderthat to move towards a school-wide curriculum reflecting the belief that "Lessis more" is a step so hard to take. In the Coalition, the schools that haveattempted it are almost without exception the ones directly seeking to empowerstudents who might not otherwise succeed.<p><hr><h2>Needed: New Assessments</h2><hr>It may be too early to tell whether teaching all students to think criticallycan also result in higher scores on the standardized tests by which we currentlymeasure success. The sense at the Coalition is that it will, even if onlybecause students will be able to analyze the test questions. But more importantthan living up to current, inadequate assessment instruments is designing newkinds of assessments that can show students actually working to solve problemson their own.<p>   In this light, the final exhibitions of mastery the Coalition advocates--examples of which Grant Wiggins has spent the year collecting--are integral tothe redesign of a curriculum around essential questions. A school must make itsalternate vision of success quite explicit--by saying clearly what studentsshould be able to know and do by the time they graduate, and by holding to itsexhibition as a test of a student's success. "The shadow cast backwards fromthat finding should be the curriculum," Ted Sizer says.<p>   Any consideration of curriculum change, therefore, must begin with anessential question for educators: "What do we really want?" What would it be toimagine a curriculum based on mastery of knowledge rather than chronologicalcoverage of facts? What if questions were encouraged to be asked that linkedseveral subjects together in a larger context, rather than making arbitrarydivisions between areas of study? What if teachers were to communicate with eachother, sharing their goals and methods freely and integrating them into eachother's courses? What if we held to the vision that all students can learn tothink well? When a school's curriculum manages to respond to these questions, wewill have before us a true exhibition of mastery, and its benefits will bepossible at last to chart.<p><hr>                             <h2>      Figure 1: Essential Questions to Shape a School's Curriculum </h2><hr>                  In every class and every subject, students will learn to ask and to answerthese questions:<p><ul><li>From whose viewpoint are we seeing or reading or hearing? From what angle or   perspective?<li> How do we know when we know? What's the evidence, and how reliable is it?<li>How are things, events, or people connected to each other? What is the cause   and what is the effect? How do they fit together?<li>What's new and what's old? Have we run across this idea before?<li>So what? Why does it matter? What does it all mean?</ul><p><hr>                            <h2>     Figure 2:  A Botany Unit Designed Around Essential Questions</h2>                 What is life, growth, "natural" development?

The factoring process is the inverse of the multiplying process, yet manystudents see the two processes as separate from one another. Many algebra textshave one chapter called Multiplying and another called Factoring; many teacherspresent polynomial multiplication, test that, and then present polynomialfactorization. Through this separation, many students often miss concepts suchas what it means for a polynomial to be in factored form and what therelationship is between multiplication and factorization.<p>   Finally, much of a student's time is taken up with the mechanics offactorization. This time focuses on the fringe of the topic rather than theessence of factorization.<p>   This section will concentrate on quadratic expressions.<p>2. The essential question is "Given a quadratic polynomial can you find whetherit can be rewritten into factored form by actually finding the factored form?"<p>3. When students can multiply binomials with ease, have them write the resultsof multiplications such as the following:<p><ul><li>(x-3) (x-7)   <li>(x+3) (x+1)  <li>(x-4) (x+2)</ul><p>Erase the original multiplication problem leaving just the correct answers. Nowask the students to see if they can recreate the original problem. They shouldbe able to find a multiplication problem that yields the answer.<p>4. How many techniques can a class come up with to find the original factoredform of the polynomial?<p><ul><li>If a polynomial can be factored is the factored form unique?<li>Is there a way to determine whether or not a polynomial can be    factored without actually finding the factors?<li>If you happen to know one factor of a polynomial, then it is an easy    matter to find the other factor. How can you find this first factor?<li>When a polynomial is rewritten into factored form, what facts    do you know about the polynomial that you didn't know before?</ul><p><hr>                                 <h2>  Figure 4: Asking Essential Questions About Aids</h2><hr>                        Two weeks before students are asked to start collecting articles on AIDS(minimum of three each).  <i>"What are the questions we need to ask about AIDS?"</i>  Alist is generated and five important aspects are chosen.  Groups with fivestudents are formed.<p>   <b>JIGSAW LEARNING. </b> All the "ones" go to a table where they research theiraspect using articles and auxiliary materials (pamphlets, section of video,etc.); all the "twos" to another table where they research their aspect, etc.Each student will later return to her/his original group as the "expert" on thataspect and thus all the "ones" will discuss their aspect among themselves sothey all understand it and will be able to explain it fully and clearly.  Theteacher circulates listening to the various groups, suggesting where necessary.At the end of the two group meetings all students should understand all fiveaspects.<p>  <b> CASE STUDIES.</b>  Assuming that bioethical decision-making has been donepreviously, one case study on AIDS is given to each group for discussion.Students will identify the problem, generate alternatives, discuss possiblesolutions in accordance with their values, and hopefully come to consensus whilerealizing the possible consequences of their decision.  The recorder for eachgroup will report of the case study, the direction of their discussion and theirsolution.  The other students can then challenge, ask questions, make comments,etc.<p>                                   <hr><h2>Figure 5: Homo-Insectivorous and the Dilemma of World Hunger</h2><hr>                   You and your team of population and nutrition experts are faced with thegrowing problem of world hunger.  Various methods are used to lessen the problemat the present time, but you believe that all food resources are not being fullyexplored.  Insects, as a food source, could be a possible solution.  Using yourknowledge and any pertinent information, devise a presentation by your team toconvince skeptics (scientists and common folk) that insects are a viable foodsource of the future.<p><hr>         <h2>                   Coaching Habits of Mind: Pursuing Essential Questions in the Classroom </h2>  by Grant Wiggins<p><hr>   What is essential must be <i>experienced</i> as essential. Essential facts andtheories are only understood as the results of one's own work; they are notself-evident notions learned through words as "knowledge," but the residue ofeffective performances--<i>Habits of Mind.</i><p>   When they are coaching students to engage in collaborative inquiry, teachersneed to insure that essential habits and norms are taught and learned. Thefollowing structures, roles, and strategies can be used to improve the qualityof group discussion, so that students may become increasingly self-regulatingand self-disciplined about their work.<p>   I have done this by dividing a class into segments: exploring, proposing,testing, linking, and closure.<p><h3>EXPLORING</h3>We do this for the first five to ten minutes, in groups of three to fourstudents. (This assumes that prior work has been assigned and done, leading towritten student questions, or organized around questions posed by the teacher.)<p><b>SCOUTING.</b> This is to explore the "panorama" from afar, in groups--the wholeterrain of the tentative issues and answers. This assumes that both the priorassignment <i>and its purpose</i> are clear to students.<p>   "Where are we going? What's the point?" To avoid these questions, pose orhave students pose "essential questions" that guide inquiry and discussion. (A"seminar" assumes that the learning is to come from the members' prior work andideas.) Help students collaborate by giving a clear set of directions and goalsfor using assignments; warn them in advance how the homework will be used inclass. In class, have students share and clarify their two or three writtenquestions from the night before, in small groups. Ask each group to try toanswer their questions, and bring one key question to the whole class. All thesekey questions are put on the board.<p><b>ENTRY POINTS.</b> Propose and consider some first "paths." Use the students'questions about the reading or exercises, putting each small group's question onthe board. Add a "scouting" summary.<p><b>PRELIMINARY "MAPPING."</b> What are the landmarks? What is our tentative consensuson the key points, passages, trouble spots?<p><h3>HYPOTHESIS PROPOSING AND TESTING</h3>What does the author or experiment mean? This part of the process takes ten tofifteen minutes, as a whole class or in two large groups.<p><b>PROPOSE. </b>Begin with the key issues derived from the first "mapping," and proposesome explanations or interpretations. This work is easily divided up into"focus" groups of four to six students who wish to work on a particular topic.They  work for fifteen minutes and then report their findings, with a list ofrelevant passages, to the class as a whole.<p><b>GO TO THE TEXT.</b> Use the text, experiment results, or students productsfrequently and carefully to test out the arguments presented by each group. Askfrequently, "What are your reasons? What is your evidence?"<p><b>SUSPEND BELIEF OR DISBELIEF WHEN APPROPRIATE. </b>When one point of view isdominant, consider an alternative.

<html> <head> <title>CES: Publications: Outside Articles: "ReformingSchools"</title></head><body><hr><h1><center>Reforming Schools: Ted Sizer does HighSchool</center></h1><hr><h3><center>by Doug Riggs<br> in The Rhode Islander Magazine,January 2, 1994<p><i>Special thanks to theProvidence Journal-Bulletin, for its permission toreproduce this article here.</i></center></h3><hr>The scene is a teacher's dream.  A classroom deep within thick,sheltering walls, beyond the reach of bells, intercoms, attendancesheets, and other distractions. Two dozen chairs form a democraticcircle, 23 of them occupied by bright, eager students. <p>Ted Sizer, seated on the 24th, is in his element.<p>"Anyone have any comments on the last two lectures?" he asks.<p>A dozen hands shoot up.  He smiles in anticipation.  Any weariness hemay have felt after a day of administrative chores is banished.<p>Theodore R. Sizer, 61, former dean of the Harvard Graduate School ofEducation, former headmaster of the prestigious Phillips Academy,Andover, former chairman of Brown's education department, leader ofthe foremost national effort to reform our high schools, is about toexercise the greatest privilege he knows He is about to teach.<p>It is something that has always been in his blood -- and remains unalterably on hisschedule, twice a week, despite the demands of his job as chairman ofthe Coalition of Essential Schools, and the even greater demands to come.<p>Nearly 700 public and private high schools across the country have joinedthe Coalition since Sizer founded it, here on the Brown campus, nearly a decadeago.  Each has pledged to leave the safe harbor of teaching-as-usual forthe shoreless sea of Reform, with Sizer as chief navigator.<p>Now he is taking the helm of an even more ambitious effort.  It startedlast October when an anonymous donor put up $5 million to found the National Institute for School Reform, an effort to bridge what Sizercalls "the fault line between theory and practice," with Sizer incharge.<p>Then, three weeks ago, Sizer was at the White House to receive a stunning Christmas present from philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg: Sizer's Institute(immediately renamed the Annenberg Institute) is getting $50 millionto carry on its work, which will include advising Annenberg on how to spendthe remainder of his $500 million "Annenberg Challenge," the largest singlegift even made to American public education.<p>Despite these obvious signs of a growing national here in this classroom,in the basement of the Salomon Center for Teaching on Brown's maincampus, Brown's most illustrious professor of education gets no respectat all.  A lot of affection, but no visible respect.  He loves it.<p><hr>"What if kids reach that point and they haven't been turned on towhatever it is that is going to turn them on?" asks a young woman on hisright, as the others wait their turn.<p>All are student-teachers, most of them graduate students, learning theirprofession by assisting Sizer with his only undergraduate class, Education100.  The young woman with the question is still in high dudgeon over an idea Sizer advanced earlier: that kids be required to go to school onlyuntil they have mastered certain basic skills; from then on, attendancewould be voluntary.<p>"Suppose they reach that level by age fourteen but they have never learnedabout genetics, or, I don't know, nineteenth-century British poetry,"the student-teacher says.  "Are we going to lose the specialists?Are we going to have one big mushy-yucky society with people who know howto read but don't have the beauty of the arts or the complexities of the sciences?"<p>"Who decides which arts are beautiful?" Sizer counters.<p>"Well, obviously that's a problem, but can't we at least--"<p>"No, no, no; don't slide off it.  It's a fundamental problem."<p>"I know that," says the student, her dudgeon sinking rapidly.<p>"You're implying that the <i>state</i>decides that Wordsworth makessense in Fox Point," Sizer says.<p>"No, I'm saying that people will have to be exposed to <i>something</i>--"<p>"My argument is I don't want you to decide for my kid, beyond basicliteracy, what he's going to read," Sizer adds.<p>The student persists: "I'm not saying that I want them necessarily to get[to a certain level], but I want them at least to be <i>exposed</i to--"<p>"I do too!  I want that desperately.  And I think the political process, on issues of this importance, is not the vehicle."<p><hr>Sizer's ideas (which are not necessarily Coalition doctrine, if, indeed,the choice-oriented Coalition can be said to <i>have</i> a doctrine)have been prompting discussion and debate around the country sincethe publication of his first "Horace" book, <i>Horace's Compromise: The Dilemma of the American High School</i> (Houghton Mifflin).<p>That was in 1984, the year George "Big Brother is watching you" Orwellchose (in 1948) as the title for his nightmare vision of a societybased on mind-numbing conformity.<p>The world didn't turn out that way, thanks in part to people likeSizer, but 1984 must have been a pretty numbing year for him anyway.During those 12 months he a) published the book, b) became chairmanof Brown's education department, and c) founded the Coalition ofEssential Schools.<p><i>Horace's Compromise</i> was Sizer's unconventional report on a study of American high schools that he had directed from 1975 to1984.  He spent two of those years visiting 50 schools throughout thecountry, talking with the kids, the teachers, the administrators.  Hisabsorbing and disturbing book is a semi-journalistic, semi-fictionaldistillation of those encounters.<p>Sizer's Horace is a composite figure, a 53-year-old high school Englishteacher, 28-year classroom veteran, "proud, respected, and committedto his practice."  In actuality, he doesn't exist.  In truth, he exists in nearly every high school in America.<p>It is through Horace, and the fictionalized-but-real compromises he mustmake -- with his students, his colleagues, his family, the clock, hisself-respect -- that Sizer reveals, more compellingly than the blizzard of data-laden studies that emerged at about that time, the deepmalaise of the American high school.<p>The book was a resounding call to dismantle our rigid, lock-step model of secondary education in favor of a less-structured, performance-centered model.  "That students differ may be inconvenient," he wrote,"but it is inescapable."<p><i>Horace's Compromise</i> was an immediate hit.<p>"In addition to his roaming-the-halls insights, this book offers [a] far-reaching blueprint for change," wrote Newsweek's reviewer.The Washington Post declared, "The agenda for this decade should be a long-overdue educational renewal.  People like Sizer...deserve a placein the thick of it."<p>Whether that last sentiment was a blessing or a curse is problematic.  Butit turned out to be good prophecy.<p><hr>When he founded the Coalition, Sizer saw it as a modest experiment in school redesign, nothing more.  He and two colleagues signed up a dozedwilling and demographically diverse public and private schools, andset to work trying to nudge them into new and better shapes fromwithin, as Horace would have.<p>Eventually, the "Essential Schools" evolved nine "common principles,"or goals, to which all Coalition schools must pledge allegiance.  Some of the goals sound as warm and fuzzy as most such statements:"The school should focus on helping adolescents learn to use their minds well..."  Others are jarringly specific: "No teacher shouldhave direct responsibility for more than 80 students."<p>Broadly speaking, the principles aim to a) banish the distractionsthat keep many schools from focusing on what happens in class, b) make it possible for teachers to know their students as individuals andteach them accordingly, and c) insist that students actuallylearn before they graduate.  Individually, the principles seem harmlessenough.  Taken together, they spell revolution.<p>They turn high schools upside down, giving far more responsibilityto teachers and students, far less to so-called policy makers.  Theyinsist on mastery of a limited number of subjects, rather than exposure to many.  They insist that students advance not according totime spent or credits earned, but only  after they havedemonstrated their grasp of a subject, by means of an individual"exhibition."<p>They made a lost of people very uncomfortable.<p>But somehow the word got around that exciting things were happeningin those schools; others began knocking at the Coalition's door.By the end of the second year, 1985, the roster had grownt0 31; a year later, to 54.  The experiment had become a movement.<p>Now, as it enters its 10th year, the Coalition's Providence-based staffalone has grown to 45, the budget is $9 million, and there's no endin sight.  Its Fall Forum, in Louisville, attracted 2,200 partisans, who gave Sizer a standing ovation.  And he has written another book:<i>Horace's School: Redesigning the American High School</i> (HoughtonMifflin, 1992).  The movement has become an institution.<p>Even now, however, it is difficult to describe exactly what an"Essential School" is.  Each is pledged to work toward realizing the ninecommon principles.  That often involves jettisoning such traditionalprops as grade levels, 45-minute periods, final exams -- and even teaching, per se (Principle Five urges "coaching" instead).<p>But each school is encouraged to "articulate" the principles in its own wayand at its own pace.  Few have done so completely; some have barelyscratched the surface.  After 10 years, the Coalition of EssentialSchools remains a work in progress.<p><hr>Ted Sizer is seated behind a simple wooden schoolmaster's desk in hisoffice at 1 Davol Square -- the kind of desk Harace might use.  Visitors have been bringing him their problems all morning, including some that have no possiblebearing on the work of the Coalition.  Each person gets his completeattention and apparent respect.  (Family members say he grants the samerespectful attention to little children, whose ideas he solicits as if they possess rare insights -- which he knows they do.)<p>He laughs easily, turning anxiety into rapport.  Often he steers the conversation onto an unexpected path, at the end of which one can glimpsea solution.  But there are no laughs when he describes what is wrongwith American education.  No easy solutions, either.<p>"It produces kids with docile minds.  They are not in he habit ofthinking hard about important things.  And that's a terriblyimportant habit in a democracy.  If the testing schemes give no creditto creativity and thoughtful analysis, just regurgitation, then thesystem is set up to create a mindless citizenry.  And that scares me.<p>"For me, the symbol of it all is the lottery.  The hypocrisy hereis absolutely laughable: We're going to have lotteries to raise moneyfor public education?  Well, lotteries depend on a citizenry thatdoesn't know any math!"<p>High schools, he says, have changed remarkably little since 1900.  "Even in the face of well-intentioned, common-sense criticism, they freezeinto the old ways and hang on for dear life.  And the more they hang on to things that do not stand the challenge of even rudimentarycommon sense, the more they lose their credibility.<p>"It's easier now than it was to talk about ambitious changes withoutbeing written off as a kook and a radical," he acknowledges, but"public confidence in public education continues to erode, fed byendless reports and criticism and finger pointing."<p>Meanwhile, a lot of the conditions that can make public education little morethan a cruel joke are largely beyond the schools' control.<p>"Various kinds of supporting agencies that make growing up tolerableare eroding," Sizer says.  "And, you know, there's gunfire insidethe schools.  There are schools with very hungry children, schools with children with no addresses.  If you don't know if you're going toeat, or if you are going to sleep anywhere that's safe, it takes yourmind off algebra."<p><hr>As the clock reaches 1:45 p.m., Sizer politely but firmly ushers a visitor out and closes the door.  It is time for one last review ofhis lecture notes before his 2:30 class.  Although he gave up thechairmanship of Brown's education department several years ago, his staffers say that nothing -- <i>nothing</i> -- interfereswith his teaching.<p>Shortly after 2 p.m., as he does every Tuesday and Thursday, he leaveshis downtown office to walk the mile or so to campus, alone.  Thewalk helps him to clear his head, he says, and focus on the important task to come.  One imagines him mentally shedding hismasks and titles, one every few steps -- Historian, Dean, Headmaster,Researcher, Author, Reformer, Administrator -- until only one is left, the one that gives meaning to all the others: Teacher.<p>His father was a teacher: art history, at Yale.  Ted was the youngestof six children, and the only boy.<p>"Ted and I grew up in Bethany, Connecticut, during the war, and itwas a magical time," recalls the only sister near Ted's age, AliceWarner, of Lexington, Massachusetts.<p>"The fact that one grows up with deprivations does not necessarilymean one does not have a happy childhood," she adds.  "I think Tedand I had a completely happy childhood.  There was stability --something we don't have anymore."<p>Those were simpler times, both say, dominated by the war.  Their dadand brothers-in-law were all in it.<p>"I daily cut the maps out of the New York Times and tracked themovement of the armies," Sizer says. "To this day, I can identifyWorld War II aircraft by silhouette.  I remember the names of currentlyirrelevant places where battles were fought.<p>"It was for a lot of people -- even very young ones, like I was --a very defining influence.  You didn't go anywhere, between gasrationing and living on a sort of a farm, which my mother kept going -- a very large vegetable garden that grew all the potatoes the whole family ate for a year.  Endless canning of beans...<p>"All of us were routinely read to every night. <i>Routinely.</i>  I just assumed that's what you did.  How many kids are read to every night now?  The hours my mother must have put into the career ofmothering -- amazing."<p>"Right was right and wrong was wrong," adds his sister, "and I don't think either of us ever knew what guilt meant."<p>Ted was an indifferent student, he says, at the private Foote School, then as now closely tied to Yale.  He went on to Yale, where he enrolled in his father's large lecture course under a pseudonym,so his dad wouldn't find out.  ("As I remember, he didn't get a terribly good grade," his sister snitches.)<p>Sizer didn't think seriously teaching until he entered the Army,during the Korean War.  He was barely 21 when the Army told him toteach a bunch of recruits -- mostly Puerto Rican kids from NewYork -- how to become a firing battery for a light howitzer:<p>"That was quite a challenge.  They didn't say, You're too young; they said,Do it.  I learned a lot in the Army: Get the incentives right.  Anddon't give people excuses for not doing things before they are askedto do it: 'I don't care if you're a semi-literate Puerto Rican; you'rea good person.  Pull up your socks and learn how to do a serioussurvey.  So you don't know any mathematics?  Here's the book.  Let'sgo on with it.' It was a good experience."<p>After the war he got his M.A.T. (Master of Arts in Teaching) degreeat Harvard, and wound up in Australia for his first teaching job.  The British-oriented schools there struck him as quite bizarre:<p>"Every boy on Thursday came to school in uniform with his rifle, which was kept at home; they were still fighting the Second World War.  Weassembled outside in our black gowns, and the prefects got eighthundred noisy kids settled down.  Then the captain of the schoolwould come out to the headmaster, tip his cap, and say, 'School is ready,sir!'  And we walked in.  I couldn't believe it!"<p>From that, he learned that schools are mirrors of their cultures,and that "no two good schools are alike, can ever be alike, becausethe important decisions are made right down close to where the kidsare, and all the palaver of headmasters, principals, and superintendentsand politicians is about a minority of the important things at the school."<p>He went back to Harvard, where he got a Ph.D. in the history of education,and stayed on to teach and eventually run the M.A.T. program andbecome dean of the Graduate School of Education -- at age 31.  Nineyears later, feeling detached from the world of schools just ashis own kids were reaching high-school age, he resigned to becomeheadmaster at Phillips Academy, Andover.<p>The old Massachusetts prep school was and is very rich, and so canafford to accept deprived kids on full scholarship.  It was there thatSizer learned the key lesson, the one that prompted him to apply forthe grant that led to the study that led to Horace and the Coalition:<p>"It is possible, if you control enough of the threads of a child's life, to profoundly change the chances that that kid has.  I saw thiswith poor, particularly minority kids.  It's not that you change theirlives; you make it possible for <i>them</i> to change their lives.  Your give them more options.  How that was done fascinated me."<p>Education 100 is a large class, 165 students.  Sizer looks vaguelyill at ease as he stands on the empty stage at the front of Room 101at the Salomon Center, fussing with a recalcitrant microphone.Some teachers enjoy the unchallenged authority and control of a lecturesituation, the chance to perform.  Sizer is not one of them.<p>Today's topic is the clash between the "top-down" school reformers, who advocate greater standardization, centralization, and nationalizationof norms, and the "bottom-up" partisans, who seek what Sizer calls"sub-local" control of the process -- by which he means making asmany decisions as possible at the school or even classroom level, wherethat crucial intersection of student, teacher, and idea takes place.<p>"The question is, Who's going to win?" he concludes. "I would bet on thesub-locals.  I don't sense any grassroots support for national exams ornational testing, or the elaborate progressive bureaucracies necessaryto develop a test.  Who wants another bureaucracy?  If anything, thecountry is tired of bureaucracies, particularly self-righteousbureaucracies that tell them the kids are no damn good."<p>Later, with the graduate students in the basement classroom, hispersonal frustration comes out:<p>"How long before we do something about a mass public-education systemthat turns out a large number of semi-literates?  How long do we haveto wait for common sense to take over?"<p>What about better training of teachers? a student suggests.<p>"We have had fifty years of efforts along those lines: We're going to professionalize teaching; we're going to raise standards; we're goingto have tougher tests, better textbooks, better-paid teachers, bettercollective-bargaining arrangements.  The result is..."<p>There is no need to finish the sentence; everyone in the room knows whatthe result is.  Only an incurable optimist would think he could makea difference -- someone like Ted Sizer.<p>"It would be quite easy for Ted to continue to be chair of the eddepartment at Brown, and be absolutely wonderfully engaged by his students and his writing, and be quite content and happy," saysDon Ernst, the Coalition's director of development, communications,and policy.  "Here's a guy who doesn't need to be taking on all thisstuff, you know?"<p>"All this stuff" includes some vigorous dissent, which comes from twogeneral sources: those who think Coalition-style reforms won't work, and those who fear they will.  Most poignantly, Sizer says, the latter group is led by the students themselves:<p>"Most high-school kids walk in, put the book on the desk, slouch,put the baseball cap on backwards, and say, Entertain me." When school is "no longer broken up into itty-bitty pieces of time inwhich you can fake a lot," and kids have to answer questions, take partin the process, a lot of them don't like it.<p>Some of the teachers don't, either.  Sometimes the reforms call for themto give up the very things they get most satisfaction from, in favor of unfamiliar methods.  And those who embrace reform must endurethe resentment of their colleagues.<p>"There's a whole bunch of criticism," Sizer acknowledges.  He saysthat some call Coalition-style reform "too soft; it leaves too muchdiscretion; the ideas are vaguely stated so people can say, 'Oh, yeah,I'm for that' -- and change nothing."<p>Others say he gives teachers too much authority and responsibility:that unless someone hands them a model to implement, reform won't work.<p>"We'll see," Sizer says.  "I'm prepared to say it won't work in mostcases.  Remember, we're trying to change an institution that has changedremarkably little in a hundred years.<p>"Another criticism is that we ignore the context in which all that takes place: that we are dangerously inattentive to regulation, unioncontracts, funding matters, politics -- all that stuff.<p>"We're going to pay much more attention to the context," he pledges,"but we're going to work very hard not to let that divert usfrom our belief that everything starts and finished with therelationship of teachers, kids, and ideas.  Get that relationshipright; then you know what the policy should be.  Most policy peopledon't address the central problem, which is that the confrontation ofteachers, kids, and ideas is not working."<p>Is the Coalition working?<P>"There's no research; there's no evidence that the kids in the Coalitionschools are doing better than kids anywhere else," complains RobertSlavin, who does his own research on teaching at Johns HopkinsUniversity.  Slavin describes himself as a "friendly critic" of Sizerand the Coalition.<p>By now, Slavin says, someone should have come up with some solid datathat could be used to grade Sizer's effort; after 10 years, the "Incomplete" on the Coalition's report card should be a trifleembarrassing.<p>Sizer and others in the Coalition acknowledge the lack of hard data."This is an area where there's great debate and some disagreement,"says spokesman Don Ernst, "because part of what we argue is thatthe current measures for making these kinds of judgments are inadequatefor the kind of work we're doing."<p>It's a Catch-22: If you believe in letting each Essential School transform itself from within, on its own timetable and in its own style -- and in the use of qualitative rather than quantitative measuresof performance -- you cannot impose the standardized testing and datagathering by which most schools gauge their effectiveness.<p>"Oh, but I think that's nowhere near an adequate response," Slavincounters.  "There's no law that says they have to use standardizedtests; they can use something else.<p>"I'm very, very supportive of the particulars of what Sizer istrying to do," he adds.  "I just wish that he or someone would do a decent study of it."<p>Sizer says that whole issue will be high on the agenda of the new NationalInstitute for School Reform, which is still in the planning stage.But there are crude measures one can use now, Sizer says, ticking them off: "Do the kids show up?  Do they stay through graduation?  Do they get into college?  Do they stay there?"<p>The anecdotal evidence is that Coalition schools do pretty well bythose measures -- some of them spectacularly well.  At violence-riddenThayer High School, in Winchester, New Hampshire, the turnaround wasso startling that someone wrote a book about it, which became the 1992NBC-TV movie <i>A Town Torn Apart.</i>  In 1981, before Thayer became an Essential School, as many of its students dropped out as went on to college -- 10 percent in both categories.  In 1990-91, 62 percentwent on to higher education, and only 1 percent dropped out.<p>But there are no controlled studies, and in several cases the data areclearly suspect.  Providence's Hope High School, like many in the Coalition, developed an Essential School within the "regular" school,and reports statistics for both.  The Essential students do betterin every category.  But, as the critics point out, that means nothing,because the best students tended to volunteer for the program in thefirst place!<p>(Essential Schools-within-schools also produce morale problems.  In onedivided schools, where the best teachers were picked for the new program,those left behind began calling themselves the Non-Essentials.)<p>So there are problems.  The programmatic ones pale beside the overarchingissues of crime, violence, poverty, and a climate of willfulignorance.  "It's a careless society," Sizer says, "quite prepared totalk about what it deserves, quite inattentive to any kind of obligation.  So that's disheartening."<p>So what gives him courage to go on?<p>"There are some schools out there whose kids do well when no oneexpected them to," Sizer says.  "You see that best in schools with a lot of low-income kids.  The schools that have broken through and done a lot of important things at once and are making noticeable changeshave dramatic impacts.  Those are the ones that, you know, just chokeyou up.<p>"You go to graduation ceremonies and walk around and talk to thesechildren, and you say, 'My goodness.  Their lives can be affected,fundamentally affected.'  And you think, 'Well, we have a function;we're not a trivial organization.'"<p>In <i>Horace's Compromise</i>, Sizer wrote: "A new design for school reform.  Will enough people somewhere want it enough to risk it, nurtureit, be honest with it, give it time?"<p>In a place of honor on his office wall there is this response, fromthe class of 1988 at Paschal High School, in Fort Worth, Texas, one ofthe earliest Essential Schools:<p>"We took the risk.  We are richer for it.  Thank you."<p>Horace would have figured that made it all worthwhile.<p></body></html>.

<h3>
Click here for the sound of termites in wood, amplified and recorded using a device called an insectoscope.<P>

By doing what they do best--chewing wood--these termites actually help the environment.  Unfortunately, at the same time they also cause quite a bit of aggravation for human homeowners.<P>
 
"Termites do provide a very valuable service in the ecology," says Dr. Vernard Lewis, an entomologist at the University of California in Berkeley.  "If it wasn't for termites, we'd probably be a thousand feet deep in wood.  The problem with termites is if it's our home, worth maybe $300,000 here in California, humans find that discouraging and disgusting.  They want to protect their investment.  And here in California, termites do about $300 million worth of damage every year, about a billion board feet of wood.  Think of a wooden wall about ten feet high and a foot thick along the long axis of California from the Oregon to Mexico border."<P>

Dr. Lewis is currently testing new techniques for exterminating termites.<P>

"I'm evaluating six different drywood termite techniques.  We are looking at two fumigant gases.  We are also looking at thermoerradication using heat.  In that case, you get the temperature up to 120 degrees and hold it for an hour.  At that level, insects will die, they overheat.  Obviously, if you can overheat them, the reverse should be possible.  Liquid nitrogen uses excessive cold;  at about minus twenty, for as few as five minutes, termites will die.<P>

"The electrogun uses electrical shock to kill termites.  Electric shock could be a combination of heat and current passing through the insect.  We are also using microwaves.  There's a certain frequency of microwaves that vibrate water molecules.  Termites, like most life forms, are 80 or 90 percent water.  So in a microwave field, the water molecules in the termites vibrate.  That produces heat, and it overheats the insect, and they die."<P>

In Northern California, Dr. Lewis has set up a small wooden house to test these extermination techniques.  He calls it La Villa Termiti.<P>  

"The first tests have been done with artificial boards.  These are boards that we engineered and we put termites in them.  These boards have three different spaces in there with twenty-five termites each, so that's seventy-five termites.  We treat them, and then open them up and count the number of dead and alive.<P>

"Under that type of testing protocol, the two fumigant gases killed all the insects, and so did the liquid nitrogen.  In the case of the liquid nitrogen, we used a very high dose.  We should probably come back and look at a more realistic dose rate.  Then the heat actually killed 99% of the insects.  The microwaves killed 96%.  And the electrogun brought up the rear at 80%.  We did a second series of tests here with naturally infested boards. It came from someone's roof in Ventura.  And that offers a little more realism."<P>

<CENTER>RAVENS WINTER</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> ravens
To the Indians of the Pacific northwest, Raven was the creator of the universe.  To other tribes, though, he was a trickster and a thief.  Well, this winter in Alaska, ravens can be seen living up to the darker side of their reputation.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Were outside of Fairbanks, Alaska, near a raven roost.  The roosting spot, usually a spruce tree on the outskirts of town, offers seclusion and protection during the winter nights for these scavengers.<P>  

They spend their days foraging through Fairbankss dumpsters and landfills, and occasionally enjoying a roadkill.  But ravens can only forage while its light, and in the Alaskan winter, the days are only a few hours long.  According to Doug Schamel at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, to find food ravens often resort to the trickery that made them famous.<P>  

A favorite ploy of the birds is to gang up and steal food from dog sled teams.  One raven runs interference, by walking around the dogs just out of the reach of their snapping jaws, while another bird helps itself to their food.  The dogs eventually catch on, but the ravens have other schemes to turn to.  Theyve figured out a way to nab baby ground squirrels.  While a mother squirrel and her young are out and about, a raven will land in their burrow.  The mother lets out a warning cry, and the babies automatic response is to run for home, where a hungry raven is waiting for them.<P>

It may come as no surprise than that many cultures see the raven as an omen of bad times to come.  But the Hudson Bay Eskimos tell a story with a positive twist in it.  They say that Raven used to go around loudly warning people when they moved their camp not to leave behind their deer-skin blanket, which is called a kak.  To this day, Ravens still fly about calling out, kak, kak, kak!<P>

Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<CENTER>UP-HELLY-AA</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Crowd
We're in the city of Lerwick, on the Shetland Islands in the far north of Scotland.  The entire town has turned out to celebrate Up-Helly-Aa, commemorating this region's Viking heritage.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

The exact meanings of Up-Helly-Aa are somewhat muddled, but on the last Tuesday of January, squads of men dressed in Viking regalia march singing through the streets of Lerwick, carrying a replica of a Norse galley before them.  We asked Peter Cooke, an ethnomusicologist and Honorary Fellow at the University of Edinborough, to recount his memories of Up-Helly-Aa.<P> 

<B>ambience<B> Procession, Squad Singing<P>
"The streets were filled with people.  49 squads of men had assembled, all with their torches alight, beautifully got up in their Viking costumes.  With the galley in the lead, they began their march.  (38:44, p. 2) Eventually, the 49 squads of men arrived at the park.  They go forward and hurl their blazing torches into the ship.  And it becomes a huge cauldron of fire.  They sing another song called 'The Norseman's Home' as the galley burns.  And their singing is almost drowned by the crackling of the flames."<P>
<B>ambienceM/B> "Norseman's Home," galley burning<P>

<B>ambience</B> bar music<P>
When the flames have died down, the revelers pack into dance halls all across town, and the squads make their rounds, performing and dancing at each hall.<P> 

"I managed to get into a hall called Arlseborough house.  The first squad arrived round about nine o' clock in the evening.  The last squad eventually arrived at eight o' clock the next morning."<P>

"I asked one young Shetlander, what was the most important thing about Up-Helly-Aa?  And he says 'oh, well, it knocks a great hole in the winter.'"<P>

<CENTER>INDRI LEMURS BREEDING</CENTER>

The Malagasy people of Madagascar tell a story that long ago the monkey-like primate called an Indri lemur gave birth to two children.  The children left their parents in the rainforest treetops, and went to cultivate the land.  There they stayed, and became the ancestors of the Malagasy.  Well, this week, it's breeding time for the Indri once again.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Indri Wails<P>
That howl is from a pair of mating Indri lemurs.  These black and white primates are about the size of a small dog and are related to humans and apes, but they can only be found in the Madagascar rainforest.  This dueting between the male and female announces their presence to the jungle.  When they stop, the call will be picked up by another pair of Indri, and then another, and so the wail passes on and on through the forest.<P> 

The Indri don't breed every year, but when they do, the mother only gives birth to one infant.  The parents and baby live together as a family, and it's the female's job to care for the newborn.  The baby clings to its mother's stomach, holding tight as they race through the treetops.<P>

The Indri spend most of their days in relaxed activity, waking late and retiring early.  They've got little to fear from human predators; most Malagasy people won't hunt the Indri.  Some say if a hunter throws a spear at one of these lemurs, the Indri will pick it up and hurl it back.  But other Malagasy just feel it's wrong to harm what they call these elders of the forest.<P>

Our special thanks to Joyce Powzyk for her help with this program.<P>

<CENTER>SETSUBUN</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Setsubun festival<P>
While Americans determine the fate of Spring by quietly watching whether or not a certain furry rodent sees his shadow, in Japan "the turning of the seasons" is marked by demons chased from temples, and sumo wrestlers hurling beans at screaming crowds.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

This week, the Japanese celebrate Setsubun, the changing of the seasons from winter to spring.  Over a thousand years ago at this time of year, farmers began offering beans to the god who taught them how to cultivate rice.  They loudly and vehemently cried out for good luck, and for any evil demons to be driven away.<P>

Today, that tradition has evolved into one of the country's most popular and exciting festivals.  It's celebrated at temples throughout Japan with Mame-maki: bean throwing.  At each temple, a sumo wrestler or other celebrity is chosen to lead the ceremony, preferably someone who's birth sign coincides with the sign of the current year.  The celebrity and priests throw beans over the crowd, who shout back:<P>

<B>ambience</B> crowd shouting "Fuku wa uchi, oni wa soto!"<P>
That means "Out with the devils!  In with good luck!"  The crowd scrambles to catch the beans, hoping to grab some luck for the new season.  Meanwhile, at some of the Setsubun celebrations, festival-goers dressed as gods drive costumed demons from the temple, and chase them out into the streets.<P>

At home, the celebration continues.  Families toss roasted beans throughout their houses, hoping to exorcise any devils from anywhere they might be hiding.  Afterwards, family members try to guarantee lucky times to come, by eating one bean for each year of their age.<P>

Now, what's all this about a groundhog?<P>

<CENTER>MANATEE MIGRATION -- Modern Benefits, Modern Dangers</CENTER>

"Save the manatee" has become a familiar conservationist's cry around the country.  This time of year, manatees are wintering in the warm waters around southern Florida.  In recent years, this endangered species's migration pattern has been unwittingly changed by humans.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> manatees<P>

We're listening to the sound of tropical manatees.  These large, peaceful marine mammals can't survive in cold water, so every winter many of them migrate to the warm shores of south Florida.<P>  

In the 1960s, a series of hydrothermal power plants opened up along the Florida coastline.  These power stations pour streams of warm water into the ocean, and are situated right in the middle of the manatee's summer territory.  Some years ago, as the manatees were preparing to head south, they stumbled on to these power plants, and spent the winter wallowing in the warm water.  As generations went by, they passed this information on to their offspring, and now nearly all the Florida manatees migrate to the power stations every year.<P>

While these power plants give the manatees a leg up by expanding their territory, they may also be endangering their lives.  As it is, south Florida is on the very upper fringe of the manatee's range, and the power stations are even further north, in cooler water.  The manatees are dependent on the warmth from the plants, but if they journey out to sea to feed and a cold front comes through, well then they're left unprotected.<P>  

The fact is that the manatees have come to rely on the power plants in the winter.  Inevitably, some of these  plants will shut down one day, leaving the manatees to search for a habitat that no longer exists.<P>

I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<CENTER>ALBATROSS NESTING</CENTER>

The bird that made the breezes blow, whose death reversed the Sun's direction in the sky.  Samuel Coleridge said that about the albatross, a sea bird whose real life behavior, while not supernatural, is none the less remarkable.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> albatross<P>

Those are the sounds of albatrosses, recorded in their courtship ritual.  By this week, most of the albatrosses in Australia and other South Pacific Islands have finished mating, and now they're tending to their eggs.  As Lincoln Fairchild at the National Park Service tells us, it's one of the few times that you'll find these birds on shore.<P>

"During non-breeding periods, albatrosses are oceanic birds, and they literally wander the Pacific.  It's only during breeding that they come to land at all."<P>

Albatrosses are mostly solitary until mating, when they choose one bird who will be their partner for life.  During nesting season, the new couple takes turns tending their eggs on shore, and during that time they're anything but alone.  The nesting sites are packed with birds, and albatrosses use their complex vocalizations to mingle with their fellow residents.<P>  

"Because they are big birds, they need a lot of room to land.  So typically what they do is they land on the beach of the island and then walk to their nest, which may be as much as 1/2 a mile away.  But to get to their nests they must pass literally thousands of albatrosses.  So walking through all these birds encourages some sociality, and they stop at each nest they come to and they chat with the nest resident, and they have the full vocal repertoire to carry on whatever discussions they feel they must carry on."<P>

<CENTER>PRAIRIE DOG MATING</CENTER>

Underneath America's great plains region this week, things are in a bit of an uproar.  You see, it's prairie dog mating season.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Scientists know surprisingly little about the prairie dog's breeding habits,  because most of the action takes place in underground burrows.  But one thing they do know for sure is that during mating season, you'll hear quite a bit of this sound.<P>

<B>ambience</B> prairie dog jump-yips<P> 

"What we're hearing are the jump-yip vocalizations of an adult black-tailed prairie dog.  Jump-yipping is performed by jumping from a position where they have all four feet on the ground to a position where they just have their hind legs on the ground, they've thrown their upper body up into the air."<P>

James Loughry is an animal behaviorist.  He tells us that jump-yipping and mating can go hand in hand.<P>

"Males tend to do a lot of jump-yipping during the breeding season, and the reason for that is that during the breeding season, males are involved in a lot of territorial defense, and within their territories they have 1, 2, 3, or 4 females, and they're defending that area against any intruding males.  During these territorial disputes, males tend to do a lot of jump-yipping."<P>

The male lives with his several females in a group called a coterie.  When the mothers give birth, their offspring will also stay with the group.  And that, of course, could give rise to inbreeding.<P>
 
"John Hoogland at the University of Maryland has shown that adult males tend to move out of the coterie after they're about two years, and this seems to be because their daughters are becoming reproductively mature.  Their daughters remain within the territory, and they move on, and that seems to be to avoid in-breeding."<P>

<CENTER>PRAIRIE DOG MATING -- Environmental Engineers</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> prairie dogs yipping and barking<P>
We're listening to what Lewis and Clark called "barking squirrels."  We know them as prairie dogs, and this week, below ground, it's mating season for these Great Plains rodents.  Above ground, prairie dogs are engaging in a type of environmental engineering.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>  

It's been estimated that at one time prairie dog colonies in America covered nearly one million acres underground.  James Loughry, an animal behaviorist, tells us that the prairie dog's underground excavations make them a major player in their ecosystem.<P>
  
"In the high plains, prairie dogs are really an integral feature of the 'balance of nature,' as it were.  They provide habitat for a variety of animals.  So that, without prairie dogs, a lot of the plains ecosystem would fall on hard times."<P>

For years, ranchers have thought of prairie dogs as a nuisance that takes grazing land away from their cattle.  The fact is that prairie dogs might actually improve grazing, by systematically removing plants that hinder the growth of grass.  Scientist Jake Weltzin described to us one experiment he performed to investigate the prairie dog's effect on mesquite, a shrub that competes with the grasses.<P>
  
"We wanted to find out whether or not prairie dogs could actually prevent mesquite from encroaching onto the landscape.  In order to determine whether prairie dogs would actually attack young mesquite, we took cuttings from mesquite and set them on the prairie dog colonies to simulate young mesquite trees growing there.  We'd come back the next day, and what we found is that prairie dogs would clip those things right off.  If it was live mesquite that was actually growing there, that would kill it.  So what we would find, and what we hypothesized was that prairie dogs would prevent mesquite from developing from a sapling into a mature tree."<P>

<CENTER>MASOALA PENINSULA RAINFOREST -- Saving Habitat</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Rainforest<P>
We're in the forest of the Masoala peninsula, on the island of Madagascar.  This area is home to some of the most diverse life forms on Earth, yet it's under constant threat of destruction to make room for ever expanding agriculture.  Now, scientists are struggling to find new strategies to win the war for preservation.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

John Veerkamp is the Assistant Director of CARE Madagascar.  He explains to us why the Masoala peninsula is unique among rainforests in the world.<P>

"The peninsula is fairly isolated from the rest of the country, and that has created ecological niches in which you find different species that you dont find anywhere else.  Just an example, we have had a person here from Harvard University who is an ant specialist who discovered ants that he calls prehistoric, that were only known from fossils, and that you find as living ants on Masoala."<P>

Mr. Veerkamp knows that the prospect of discovering new insects isn't enough to convince local villagers to preserve the rainforest, so instead of pleading to their hearts and minds, he's taken a more practical approach.<P>
  
"Our strategy is based on the assumption that people will only respect the environment and will only respect the forest, if they have an economic benefit from it.  So what we have been doing is looking for these economic values that you could extract from this forest, and there are different options that we have started working on."<P> 

"One is butterfly farming, which is a very easy activity, as such, and the only thing you need to do is plant the right host trees next to the forest, butterflies will come lay eggs on the host trees.  You protect the caterpillars from parasites, and once they become pupae, you collect them and you export them."<P>

<CENTER>SAIMAA SEAL BIRTHS</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Saimaa seal breathing<P>
That heavy breathing is coming from a Saimaa seal. These marine mammals are unlike any other in the world, and right now is the season when their seal pups are being born.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Most seals are confined to saltwater oceans, but tucked away in one of the coldest corners of the globe, there exists two little-known freshwater species.  One is the Ladoga in Russia, the other is the Saimaa seal, occupying the intertwined rivers and lakes of the region in Finland that shares its name.<P>

Today, walking along the shore of one of those lakes, you might come across an innocuous pile of snow on top of the frozen water.  Inside that mound, a mother Saimaa seal lies huddled with her newborn pup.   The only entrance is from the water below, and the temperature inside the igloo-like  nest stays constant at just above freezing, keeping the new family somewhat cozy.<P>

Well, that young pup has a tough time ahead of it, though.  There are only about 200 of the species left in existence.  In the past, the seals' main enemies were the nets of local fishermen, in which baby Saimaas could easily become entangled.<P>  

But recently, net fishing's been banned from the seal's habitat, and a project's been undertaken to attempt to double the seals' population in the next thirty years.  Activists are urging the Saimaa people to recognize the seal as a symbol of their identity and a unique source of pride for their homeland.  Lassi Karivalo, a devout conservationist often called "the Seal Man," has put the issue succinctly: "The whole Saimaa region," he says, "will be nothing without the seal."<P>

<CENTER>PEACOCKS MATING</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> peacocks<P>
That's a sound you might hear in India,  Sri Lanka, and elsewhere in Asia this time of year, when peacocks are mating.  Some believe that in their shimmering tail shines the eyes of God, while others consider them nothing but bad luck.  Whatever the opinion, peacocks are probably the most recognizable of all birds, and this week, courting males are putting their famous tail feathers to good use.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

The true name for these birds is peafowl; peacocks are the male of the species, and are the only ones with the trademark luxurious, sparkling, tail feathers.<P>

That cry is a male peacock warning neighboring males off of his territory.  He's searching out a mate, and he doesn't want any competition.  After fighting off one or two other courters, his domain will be established and the male will use his feathers, and a little bit of trickery, to attract females.<P>  

The peacock acts if he's pecking at food, with his head to the ground and his tail above to draw attention to himself.  The potential mate scurries over in hopes to grab a meal, and the suitor stands upright and entices her with his shining tail.  The male repeats this ritual several times every season, and mates with a few females.  Each of them will then raise her eggs on her own.<P>

In the past, peacocks were shipped over to America, to roam the grounds of estates.  If one tired of just admiring the birds from afar, a peacock feast was considered a distinct symbol of wealth.  Today, partially as a result of human harvesting of the birds, several types of peafowl are at dangerously low numbers.  But for this time of year at least, the peacocks are working hard to remedy that situation.<P>

<CENTER>VITAL SIGNS MONITOR -- Medicine</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Heartbeat<P> 
The days of a cold stethoscope on the chest may soon be over.  Instead, doctors will check your heart rate without even touching your body.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"The next generation of diagnostic devices will measure your vital signs without contacting the individual."<P>

At the Georgia Institute of Technology, scientists are developing a vital signs monitor that uses microwave radiation to measure a person's heart and breathing rates, without actually touching them.  Michael Burrow, a Senior Research Engineer on the project, says that this technology could offer a new way to care for patients whose vital signs can't be monitored by current means.<P>  

"There are many applications for this technology.  One could conceive of this device being in a neo-natalogy unit, to monitor the heart rate and respiration rate of infants, whose skin is very thin.  It's very hard to put electrodes on them.  You could also think of a burn unit, where you don't have access to putting electrodes on an individual."<P>  

Mr. Burrow hopes to expand this technology to measure not only breathing and heart rates, but also blood pressure, temperature, and other vital signs.  The monitor could then lead to new opportunities in home health care.<P>

"I think this technology will be a part of our lives and our homes, where we will be able to monitor our diagnostic information from the home, and that gets transmitted to our physician.  I believe that eventually we will be able to access medical care from our home, and it will eliminate, to a large extent, the amount of time that we have to spend in a doctor's office."<P>

<CENTER>SNOWY OWLS WANDER SOUTH</CENTER>

New England and the mid-Atlantic regions of the United States have some unusual visitors this week.  Snowy owls are making their way South.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Snowy Owls<P>

The screech of snowy owls is a sound usually found in the Arctic, but if you live in New England, don't be surprised if you hear it this evening.  These predators spend most of their time on the tundra, eating various rodents.  But it's winter, their prey is dwindling, and the snowy owls are heading for warmer weather to find food.<P>

"Snowy owls basically head South during the wintertime.  They generally come in sometime in November and they leave sometime in April."<P>

Norman Smith is with the Blue Hills Trailside Museum in Massachusetts.  He says that, unlike most birds, snowies don't follow a set migration path.  Instead, these predators merely wander South until they find a place that suits them, often ending up in the Northeastern United States.  If you're lucky enough to see one, snowy owls are indeed a sight to behold.<P> 

"Snowy owls are birds that are basically about 23 inches tall, they have a wing span up to about 5 feet in length, they can weigh up to about six pounds.  The adult males can be immaculately white, with no black markings at all, and the females are basically white with dark barring on their back, their heads, and their chests, also on their wings."<P> 

"They eat a variety of different food items, anywhere from the size of a small mouse to rats, which are preferably their favorite.  They eat a good deal of small birds and waterfowl, and we've actually seen them capture birds as large as a Canada goose, and we actually photographed one capturing a Great Blue Heron, which stands four feet tall.  So they are tremendously powerful birds."<P>

<CENTER>SNOWY OWLS WANDER SOUTH -- Airports</CENTER>

If you spent your summers on the wind-swept plains of the Arctic, where would you spend your winters?  How about the windswept runways of a major airport?  Well, that's where some snowy owls are making their home this week.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience/B> Bird-spotting conversation<P>

We're at Logan Airport in Massachusetts, with Norman Smith of the Blue Hills Trailside Museum.  He's talking with a member of the airport's bird patrol about one of it's most unusual winter visitors: the snowy owl.  The owls leave the plains of their Arctic tundra home every winter to find food, and they often end up living in airports in the Northeastern United States.  Why airports?  Well, it may be because the snowies are homesick.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Snowy Owls<P>

"This area is 2400 acres of short mowed grassland, and if the owls, which can fly up to elevations of about 8000 feet, see this as they're flying by, it probably looks more like home than any other area around."<P>

Snowy owls don't necessarily make Logan a regular stopover on their trips.  In fact, the snowies are unusual among birds in that they don't follow any specific migration pattern every year.<P> 

"What I've found out is that the owls don't seem to come back year after year.  Out of 123 snowies that I've banded here, only three have returned."<P>

But the owls that do winter at Logan certainly make themselves at home.<P>

"Snowy owls can be seen virtually just about anywhere at the airport, whether it's on the marshland, or on the grassland of the runway approaches, or sometimes they even sit on the middle of taxiways, or these random signs, or even some of the control towers."<P>

It might not be the Arctic, but with plenty of tasty rodents, Logan Airport will do nicely for the winter.<P>

<CENTER>NORTHERN ELEPHANT SEALS MATING</CENTER>

It has all the earmarks of tabloid headlines: an island getaway, sex, violence, power struggles, frustrated lovers, and even harems.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Elephant seals<P>  

We're listening to the bellows of a 16 foot, two ton male northern elephant seal.  This is their mating season, and the seals have come down from the North Pacific to breed on warm islands off the coast of Southern California and Mexico.  They arrived a few weeks ago, and for some it's a veritable mating frenzy.  For others, it's an exercise in frustration.  Bernie LeBoeuf, a Professor of Biology at the University of California in Santa Cruz, sets the scene on Ano Nuevo, one of the elephant seals breeding grounds.<P>

"Typically you have about 3000 elephant seals breeding there every winter.  The species is also noted to be highly polygynous, a few males inseminate a great number of females, and that is only possible in a situation in which the females are clumped in time and space.  These clumps of females are traditionally called harems.  Then you'll have more than one male in the harem competing with each other to mate with females, such that the male at the top of the peck order beats up every other male, and his reproductive success will be correlated with his rank."<P>

So the alpha male fights off his challengers, establishes his beach head and his harem, and what happens is, a little bachelor pad of lesser males camps out nearby.  They're waiting for any opportunity that might arise in the form of a stray female.  Otherwise they have to sit on the sidelines, watching the big guy have all the fun, and saying the elephant seal equivalent of 'Wait till next year.'"<P>

<CENTER>NORTHERN ELEPHANT SEALS MATING -- Sounds</CENTER>

This week, the Pacific Islands off the coast of California are alive with the bellows of mating elephant seals.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"An elephant seal is a marine mammal.  It's the largest pinniped, that is to say seal or sea lion, in the sea."<P>

Bernie LeBoeuf is a professor of biology at the University of California in Santa Cruz.  He's tells us that elephant seals are very unique, and not just because they're the size of a small car.  They also have a distinctive series of calls.<P>

"A bull elevates his four quarters on his four flippers.  He opens his mouth, during which his nose falls into his mouth, and then he emits a sound that sounds something like this."<P>

<B>ambience</B> Male Elephant Seals<P>

It's mating season for the seals, and these calls play an important part in the breeding process.<P>

"It means to another male that he's being threatened, and that unless he wants to fight this male, he'd better move away."<P>

During the mating season, the males fight for dominance, and only the winner gets to breed.  That honk is kind of a call to arms.<P>  

Meanwhile, the female elephant seals have just given birth to the pups they conceived last season.  The island's crowded with the new members, so the mothers have their own special calls to communicate with their pups.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Female Elephant Seals<P>

"Females make sounds that are important biologically.  There's a pup attraction call which serves to attract the pup to her.  If it's getting in trouble, it's very important that they remain in close proximity to each other."<P>

"There is a period of dueting between a mother and its pup in which they form a social bond and they come to recognize each other.  Vocalization is very important in that process."<P>

The Chluse will perform a few of these yodels, as a wish for a Happy New Year to the villager, who rewards them with a drink of wine or cider, and usually some money.  After thanks are exchanged, the group will move along, until they reach another house on the lane.  They'll continue their journey until midnight, when they stop to sing and celebrate in  the New Year with the rest of the villagers.<P>

<CENTER>BISON WINTER AT YELLOWSTONE</CENTER>

To some Native American tribes, the buffalo, or bison, was said to be a predictor of the weather.  If its coat was thick, then a harsh winter was at hand.  Well, let's hear how bison are faring this winter, at Yellowstone National Park.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Thermal Hot Springs <P>

Winters are long and harsh in Yellowstone, and hot springs, like the ones we're listening to now, provide whatever scarce warmth there is to be found in the park.  According to Wildlife Biologist John Mack, many of the about 3000 bison that spend the winter in Yellowstone cling to these steamy thermal areas.  But the bison still need to forage away from the hot springs, so they'll spend the winter searching through the snow for whatever sedges and grasses they can find.<P>  

<B>ambience</B> Bison<P>

Luckily, the bison are well adapted for the winter.  Unlike deer and elk, bison can manage in very deep snow.  They swing their massive heads back and forth, sweeping through the snow reach the grasses underneath.<P>

But physical hardiness isn't always enough for the bison.  Their success in the winter is dependent on the environmental conditions throughout the year.  During the summer months, the bison are eating and fattening up in the higher elevations of the park.  When winter arrives, if the temperature is very low or if layers of ice cover the undergrowth, the bison may have to rely on their fat reserves to survive.<P>  

And yet the bison have survived massive hunting by man, the narrowing of their range to a fraction of its original size, and thousands of winters past.  They are, according to Black Elk, the Chief of all animals, representing the Earth and the totality of everything that is.<P>

<CENTER>LOONS MIGRATE</CENTER>

They say that once you've heard the call of the loon, you'll never forget it.  These aquatic birds have fascinated man for thousands of years, and this week, they're heading South.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Loons

Loons spend all their time in the water or in the air; these goose-size birds are incapable of walking on the ground.  Some people call them living submarines, because of their amazing diving ability; they'll float passively on the surface of the water, and then suddenly descend sixty feet to catch a fish.<P>  

During the summer, loons are found in the upper half of North America, but these days, they're migrating South to find warmer waters for the winter.  William Barklow, a Professor of Biology at Framingham State College, has studied loons for years.<P>

"There are four different species, only one of which you see very frequently in the United States.  It's unfortunate  we call the bird we have here a common loon, they're anything but, they're very special.  In fact, in England they're referred to as the Great Northern Diver, which I think is much more appropriate and I wish we had that term for them here."<P>

Be they loon or great northern diver, these birds have enthralled people for centuries.<P> 

"There's an outcropping, a  granite outcropping on Lake Superior that has a carving of a loon that has been estimated to be 10,000 years old.  So apparently they were influencing the Indians back that long ago."<P>

The loon's most striking feature is its haunting call.  For Native Americans, it's the stuff of legend.<P>

"The Cree Indians had one, that the wail, that mournful sound, one of the four calls that the loon makes, is a warrior forbidden entry into heaven, and that at night he is howling out his plight at not being able to get to heaven."<P>

<CENTER>HUMPBACK WHALES BREEDING -- Look and Legend</CENTER>

Off the coast of Mexico, a forbidding black form rises out of the water, and submerges.  From the depths it makes a sound that you can hear through the hull of a ship.  It's a humpback whale, and it's the time now of they're breeding season.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Humpback Whale Songs<P> 

Pacific humpback whales have migrated down from the North, where they feed during most of the year, to warmer breeding grounds in waters just south of Mexico.  Pregnant females arrived first and gave birth to their new calves.  The males and the rest of the females followed, and their mating season has begun.<P>  

David Mattila, a Senior Scientist at the Center for Coastal Studies, tells us what it's like to encounter one of these amazing creatures.<P>

"Well, when you first see them, of course the size is what grabs you first.  But then if you see them up close, humpback whales look kind of like a black dill pickle with wings, really.  They have bumps on their head and they have these long, flippers, they're about a third of the body length."<P>

The sound we're hearing is possibly the most distinctive feature of the humpback whale: its song.  This is a specific call made only by males, and primarily at breeding season.  Though scientists are still debating it's exact meaning, the song may be the source of many of the legendary sea stories that have come down to us today.<P>

"It certainly is possible that many of the myths and legends revolving around the ocean, things like the Sirens and the sea monsters probably originated in sailors hearing the sounds of humpback whales through the hull of the vessel.  It's a very loud sound.   If you're in the water within 100 yards of a whale singing, your whole body will vibrate from the sound, but you have to be fairly close to hear it coming through the hull.  It certainly is an odd enough sequence of sounds that it could've contributed to many of the myths of the ocean."<P>

<CENTER>HUMPBACK WHALES BREEDING -- Songs</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Humpback Whale Songs<P>
Beneath the waves of the warm, clear waters off the coast of Mexico this week, humpback whales glide through their winter breeding grounds.  That ethereal cry echoing across the ocean may be their way of saying "What's a whale like you doing in a place like this?"  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

The humpback whales we're hearing now were recorded off the coast of Baja.  Every year, anywhere from 100 to a few thousand humpbacks from Northern California, Canada, and Alaska, migrate here to mate.<P> 

"The large whales spend the majority of their time in colder water, at least most of them do, but they migrate from a cold water feeding ground into a warm water breeding ground in the winter."<P>

David Mattila, a Senior Scientist at the Center for Coastal Research, tells us that what we're hearing is a song, one specific type of call that the male humpbacks make.  It has a distinct purpose during  breeding, but it's still under debate as to whether the song is a call to mate, or a call to arms.<P>

"Dr. Roger Payne is the gentleman who discovered that humpback whales sing.  After he discovered that, people began to notice that the singing only occurred in the breeding grounds.  They began to notice that the humpback whales that were singing were almost always alone and they were were pretty good size whales, and when another whale joined them, they stopped singing.  We began to suspect that the humpback whales that were singing in the breeding grounds were the mature males.  Everybody sort of jumped to the conclusion that the song was a mating call, and that they were advertising for a mate.  Recent work has shed a little bit of doubt on that because most of the whales that join the males that are singing have turned out to be other males, and they don't swim off peacefully into the sunset.  They get into fights.  So some people think the song may be an acoustic display that the males use in order to establish a dominance hierarchy in the breeding grounds."<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER VIRUSES</CENTER>

It multiplies endlessly, spreads on contact, and its effects can be devastating.  Cyberspace's version of the plague is the computer virus.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Steve White is a Senior Manager at IBM Research.  He studies computer viruses, and unfortunately he has a new to virus to look at virtually every day.<P> 

"The first computer viruses for IBM compatible computers were first seen in 1987, and they've been increasing in number ever since. There are over 8000 known computer viruses, and they're being created at an average rate of about six a day."<P>

So for whatever reason, someone takes the time and trouble to program a computer virus, and tries to unleash it into cyberspace.  But what sort of threat does it pose?<P>

"A computer virus is a program or a little piece of a program that when it runs, it makes another copy of itself someplace.  Every computer virus changes legitimate programs or documents in ways that you don't intend.  Some are very overt.  They'll trash your hard disk and make you lose all your data.  Others are more subtle, they mostly just spread."<P>

As the world becomes increasingly computerized, the potential danger of a virus also increases.<P>

"So, like a biological virus that makes a lot of copies of itself, a computer virus will infect a legitimate program that you have: a spreadsheet, or an editor.  When you run that spreadsheet or that editor, the virus will make copies of itself in other programs.  Pretty soon, more and more of your programs are infected.  If you give a program to someone else or someone else uses a program from your computer that's infected, they'll become infected.  So it spreads from program to program, computer to computer, country to country."<P>

We'll hear more about computer viruses, and how to prevent them, in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER VIRUSES -- Cleaning the Net</CENTER>

You download some software from the internet, and unbeknownst to you, it's infected with a computer virus.  When you email the software as an attached document to some of your friends, you're helping to spread the virus around the world.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"This is a computer program that simulates virus spread.  There's a short beep whenever there's a new virus infection."<P>

<B>ambience</B> Simulated Virus Spread<P>

That's a time-lapsed version of how a computer virus spreads.  These days, a virus takes anywhere from several months or a year to span the globe.  But Steve White, a Senior Manager at IBM Research, is thinking about the future.<P>

"We think the computer virus problem is going to get worse in the next few years as more and more people hook up to the net.  As that happens, computer viruses can be transmitted more rapidly, and their population can increase a great deal."<P>

Mr. White has a team of computer programmers working to prevent global virus infection.  When a new computer virus is discovered, these engineers immediately begin analyzing and learning how to control it.<P>

"What these very clever people do is they put the virus on a computer and they look a the bits and bytes of the virus to determine what it does.  They reverse engineer the virus.  And then they'll be able to craft detection and disinfection for that particular virus based on what they see."<P>

The programmers then send their information around the world, so that any further outbreaks can be averted.  But as viruses spread faster and faster, new techniques need to be developed to stop them.  We'll hear more in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER VIRUSES -- Safe Email?</CENTER>

Millions of people interact with each other every day on the internet, and they're all vulnerable to computer viruses.  We've all heard about safe sex, but how do we practice safe computer?  Im Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

If you've spent anytime on the internet in a usenet group or any of the on-line communities that share email, you've probably heard some kind of warning about the dreaded Good Times virus.  It's a scenario which demonstrates that people are still largely unaware how computer viruses can be spread.  Steve White is a Senior Manager at IBM Research.<P>

"The Good Times Virus is a hoax that's been circulating around the Internet.  The note that you typically see warns you about this horrible Good Times virus and says 'make sure you warn all your friends.'  So the first thing you do is you send this off to all your friends.  It spreads much the same way that a computer virus does, but it itself is just a note that's spread by silly humans like you and I."<P>

While it's impossible to contract a computer virus simply by sending or reading an email message, there are ways that viruses can be sent on-line.<P>  

"Many email systems can have attached documents. There are now viruses that infect documents.  So I could send you a Microsoft Word document and if you open that Microsoft Word document and it were infected, then you could get a virus that way."<P>

So how's an everyday computer-user supposed to protect themselves from an infection?<P>

"The most important thing that you can do is to get good, reliable anti-virus software and keep it up to date.  New viruses come out all the time, and anti-virus software has to be updated to deal with them.  A second good thing that you can do is to write-protect your diskettes.  Your diskettes have a little black tab on them, when you open up that tab so you can see through it, the computer can't write to that diskette.  If the computer can't write to that diskette, it can't infect that diskette.  It's always important to keep backups of your system, it's the ultimate protection from something going wrong."<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER VIRUSES -- Digital Immunity</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Simulated Virus Spread<P>
Each beep you're hearing represents a computer somewhere becoming infected with a new virus.  It's a time lapse simulation of how a virus spreads.  The increase of computer viruses around the world has scientists turning to biological models to learn how to control them.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"As more and more people hook up to the net, viruses spread much more quickly.  We're concerned about a day when a virus doesn't take years to get around the world, but minutes."<P>

Steve White is a Senior Manager at IBM Research.  He's using the human body's biological defenses as a guide for eliminating computer viruses.<P>

"We've looked at the immune system in humans and understood how it finds completely new viruses, picks them apart, figures out how to detect them and remove them, and we're crafting what we call an immune system for cyberspace that does just the same thing."<P>

"Here's how we envision that it'll work.  In the middle of the night, a computer in Luxembourg will detect something odd going on and say 'Gee, this might be a virus.'  It'll find the suspicious file or suspicious bit of the system, package it up, send it off over the Internet to secure computers here in our lab at IBM research.  Those computers will take this suspected virus, figure out if it is a virus, and if it is, automatically analyze the program to figure out what it does and how to remove it.  That information will be sent back to Luxembourg, but it will also be sent all over the world.  So if the virus starts to spread from Luxembourg, the cure will already be there to prevent it from spreading widely."<P>

"So over the next year and a half, improvements in the product will lead to a global distributed system that can find and eliminate viruses all over the world automatically."<P>

We'll hear more about computer viruses in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER VIRUSES -- The Virus Hunters</CENTER>

At this very moment, computer viruses are lurking, waiting to be downloaded into unsuspecting PCs.  But not to worry; virus hunters are hard at work, learning how to conquer infections from the inside out.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Virus Conversation<P>

That's Jeffrey Kephart and David Chess, two scientists at the IBM Research Center, analyzing a new computer virus.  They're picking it apart, trying to learn exactly how it works, and how to control it.<P> 

"It's more like solving a crossword puzzle, I think.  You have a thing sitting there and you have to figure out how it hangs together, how parts of it relate to other parts, what it's doing, what's behind it."<P>

Mr. Chess and Mr. Kephart are part of a defense team trying to prevent worldwide virus infection.  Once they have a virus deciphered, they send programmed disinfection for it all over the globe, to prevent future outbreaks.  Soon, they hope to develop an automatic computer system that'll analyze and remove viruses without their help.  But, in the meantime, the human defense team is doing very well on its own.<P>

"The world of computers is a manmade world.  So we have a much better chance of being able to devise cures for computer viruses.  There isn't any virus that has ever been created so far that has presented that much of a difficulty for people like Dave."<P>

"I think part of the perception is that at least some parts of the public think that these must be sort of super genius programmers doing these things.  I think that's not true at all.  Writing a virus is not difficult.  Viruses are very simple programs.  All they do is read other programs, write to them, they do nothing that requires any particular skill in anything to code.  Millions of people have the capability of writing viruses and we're just happy that as few as several hundred actually do it."<P>

<CENTER>BIO-ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY</CENTER>

Patients with kidney failure need to spend hours a day attached to a device which filters the toxins from their blood.  But now scientists are researching a way to free patients from this dependency.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Dialysis Machine<P>

We're listening to a dialysis machine, a device which acts as a mechanical kidney.  It's the typical method for treating kidney failure, but as Dr. David Humes, Chairman of the University of Michigan Medical Center explains, dialysis is a far from perfect process.<P>  

"Currently, the treatment with dialysis is life sustaining, but the quality of life is certainly poor.  Patients require 4-6 hours of dialysis treatment at least 3 times a week.  The patient has to get up, get dressed, drive to the center for dialysis, be tethered to a machine that treats and removes the toxins over four to six hours, has to then get off the machine, dress and return home.  That ends up being a full day type of process."<P>

To research an alternate treatment for dialysis, Dr. Humes is growing kidney cells in his lab.<P>

"We have been fortunate to be able to grow kidney cells outside the body in incubators.  Were able to take kidney tissue and expand the important stem cells, or the parental cells, so that from a few thousand cells we can expand, outside the body, the number of cells to billions."<P>

Dr. Humes hopes to use these home-grown cells, combined with a synthetic filter, to create a part organic, part mechanical organ that can be implanted into a person.  If this technology works, it will free patients with kidney failure from their dependence upon the dialysis machine.<P>

We're at the University of Michigan's Medical Center, listening to the sounds of a dialysis machine.  It filters out toxins from the body, to help replace a patient's failed kidneys.  But as Dr. David Humes, the Chairman of the Center explains, dialysis doesn't do all the work of the kidneys.<P>
 
"What its missing is all those energized type of metabolic processes that the kidneys can produce for the body, not only take away toxins, but also replace important nutrients as well as important types of hormones.  Although its life sustaining, a patient has a worse life expectancy on dialysis than a patient with newly diagnosed lung or prostate cancer.  Patients feel chronically fatigued, they dont have energy, and they many times are unable to return to work."<P>

Dr. Humes is developing an artificial organ that would replace all the functions of a failed kidney.  It combines man-made devices with actual kidney cells grown in a lab.  These cells allow this bio-artificial kidney to not only filter toxins, but also perform the life-sustaining functions that dialysis can not reproduce.<P>  

"The plan is to develop two devices, both of which are important for full replacement of the kidney.  One will be a filter that could be implantable, so that a patient will not be tethered to a machine.  Two, it not only replaces what dialysis does, but adds and optimizes care that dialysis does not provide currently."<P>

<CENTER>BIO-ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY -- Tissue Engineering</CENTER>

A new alternative to kidney transplants may be on the way.  Instead of removing a healthy kidney from a donor, scientists will just make one in the lab.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. David Humes is the Chairman of the University of Michigan Medical Center.  He's studying a process called tissue engineering.<P>

"Tissue engineering is a burgeoning, developing field combining medical science, and bio-engineering science.  The idea stems from forty years of dialysis technology and the understanding that it has been optimized to a point of almost pure perfection from a synthetic process.  That to have any further improvement, missing pieces had to be added, and those were the biologic, cellular components."<P>

Dr. Humes hopes to use tissue engineering to create artificial organs, by combining man-made materials with actual biological cells grown in the lab.<P>

"What is revolutionizing this approach of tissue engineering is the ability to identify distinguished cells from various body parts or tissues, and grow them up in mass.  For example, your skin cells: part of your skin can be removed, and under the right culture conditions, the skin can replicate and form a new sheet of skin."<P>

"With regards to tissue engineering in general, this may bring an opportunity for tissue replacement and organ replacement for chronic disease such as liver failure, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney failure, and severe burns."<P>

But don't throw away your donor card just yet; it'll be some time before we see bio-artificial organs in human patients.<P>

<CENTER>LANDFILL GENERATOR -- Powering Up</CENTER>

That stale bread you threw away a few months ago might be powering your television tomorrow.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Gas Compressor<P>

We're listening to a generator that's powered by methane gas coming from the decaying garbage in a landfill.  The gas is collected, and then chemically converted into electricity by a device called a fuel cell.  As Dr. Ronald Spiegel, a Senior Research Engineer for the EPA explains, a single landfill could potentially power an entire neighborhood.<P>

"An ordinary landfill, depending on its size, could generate anywhere from a few kilowatts of power to several megawatts of power.  Were currently using a 200 kilowatt fuel cell at a landfill in Groton, CT.  The 200 kilowatt fuel cell does not use all the potential gas that that landfill can produce, but the electricity from that 200 kilowatt fuel cell can produce enough electricity for 100 homes.  So, if you took that landfill, and you actually utilized all the gas, possibly 500 to 1000 homes could be fueled from the gas from that landfill."<P>

With some careful planning, power can be drawn from a landfill for several years.<P>

"Normally, methane gas can be produced in landfills for twenty years or longer, but that number depends on how hard the gas is being pulled out of the landfill.  So its kind of a balancing act; you dont want to take too much gas from the landfill, but on the other hand you dont want much of the gas to be emitted into the atmosphere either."<P>

The technology used in the landfill generator has other applications as well, and we'll hear more in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>LANDFILL GENERATOR -- Not Just Garbage</CENTER>

A technology which may reinvent our nation's power supply system is currently sitting on a landfill in Connecticut.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Gas Compressor<P> 

We're listening to a generator that creates power from the methane gas emitted from a landfill.  The gas is first cleaned, and then chemically converted into electricity by a device called a fuel cell.  Dr. Ronald Spiegel, a Senior Research Engineer for the EPA, sees this technology being used in any location that has waste methane gas.<P>

"For example, waste water treatment plants have a process called anaerobic digestion where they reduce the sludge to smaller quantities, which in the process also produces waste methane gas. So the clean-up system can be used there to clean that gas up to be used for example, in fuel cells."<P>

Fuel cells easily convert natural gas into electricity.  And, despite their high cost, Dr. Spiegel predicts they'll soon be common sources of energy.<P>

"The fuel cells are relatively new technology; their cost today is probably a factor of two or so more expensive than some other comparable technologies which can generate electricity from gas.  However, the advantage of fuel cells are that they're much more efficient, quiet, and clean. Any place there's natural gas available, fuel cells can be utilized. And so its envisioned in the future that instead of central station power-distribution systems, there could be more widely-disseminated, smaller power distribution systems.  For example, big buildings that basically generate their own electricity from natural gas using fuel cells.  Hospitals, airports, these sort of possibilities."<P>

<CENTER>FISH SCALE FERTILIZER</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Fish processors voices, bouncing fish<P>
On the coast of Senegal in West Africa, women spend their days processing fish.  Well lately theyre busier than ever, because this staple food of their country is now an agricultural resource.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>FX</B> Olean Latud explaining in Wolof how fish are used<P>

Olean Latud has worked as a fish processor for thirty years.  She is explaining how none of the fish is wasted; even the scales have a purpose.  In years past, farmers would buy the fish waste to use as fertilizer.  But now, scientists are reviving and expanding this practice, in an attempt to improve local agriculture.  Tom Cussack is a professor from Oregon State University, working in Senegal.<P>

"We observed that many of the farmers were coming to purchase these residues.  The farmers obviously believed they were doing some good, and essentially the results show that it can be very effective as a way of increasing yields.  So we designed a small research project to see if this technology could be utilized by many farmers, or under which conditions this could be most effectively used by farmers."<P>

"We don't necessarily try to do something that's very technological, because usually really complicated things cost too much for the normal farmer and require too much of a change in his attitude towards how he does his work.  So this is a relatively small change and something which some farmers are all ready practicing.  So we hope to get quite a good impact from only a small amount of money spent on this research."<P>

<CENTER>FISH SCALE FERTILIZER -- It's Chicken Feed</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Fish processors singing<P>
Singing as they work to help pass the day, women on the coast of Senegal in West Africa process freshly caught fish.  Now, scientists are using the byproducts of the fish processing to improve the country's economy.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"The objective is to assist the national agricultural research institute here in undertaking good agricultural research.  Mainly in the area of natural resources management, in terms of developing specific technologies that farmers can use."<P>

Tom Cussack is a professor from Oregon State University, working in Senegal.  He and other scientists are trying to utilize the leftovers from fish processing, by encouraging farmers to use them as an agricultural fertilizer.  In only a few years, they have managed to expand the use of fish debris from grain farming, to vegetable growing, and now to a different branch of agriculture. <P> 

"That same fish debris can be used for adding to chicken feed.  It may have a more valuable use for chicken feed."<P>

In the past, the biggest difficulty has been covering the cost of transporting fish scales from the coast of Senegal to the farms in the interior.  But now, chicken producers might offer a solution to that problem.<P>

"If the poultry producers increase the demand for it, and they are more widely dispersed in the country, they may be able to pay for the additional transport costs, and still make a good profit.  And it certainly gives an incentive for local producers of chickens to substitute local product, compared to importing other additives from abroad."<P>

<CENTER>DENIM RECYCLING</CENTER>

The jeans we wear are made of cotton that was once growing in the ground.  That cotton's picked and turned into denim.  But between the denim fabric and a finished item of clothing, there's typically a lot of waste that can't be recycled...until now.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Loom<P>

That's the sound of a loom at a factory in North Carolina.  It creates denim by weaving together thousands of strands of cotton yarn.  As Darlene Ball, the Customer Service Director of Burlington Denim explains, much of the fabric that comes out of the factory ends up being wasted.<P>

"Every time we ship a yard of fabric to someone who cuts and sews and manufactures the jeans, we lose about 10 percent of that yard.  And the reason for that is, when you lay your pattern pieces out, then you cut out your pieces you have little scrap.  That turns out to be about 70 million pounds of waste fabric."<P> 

Instead of sending all that unused denim to a landfill, Burlington's developed a way to recycle the fabric, so that the yarn can be reused.  Though it seems obvious enough, recycling denim isn't as easy as it sounds.<P>

"If we think about the fact that the fabric is woven, it has warp yarns, it has filling yarns, that are interlaced, that tells us that in order to use scrap we must take that apart.  So the process is actually to take large cutters which cut the fabric into smaller pieces, and then pull the small pieces apart, and try to separate the yarns back out again.  Its simply just taking the woven fabric back down to fiber form."<P>

By reusing that fiber, millions of pounds of cotton can be saved every year.<P>

<CENTER>DENIM RECYCLING -- Applications</CENTER>

Soon, we may be sorting our recyclables into glass, paper, plastics, and clothing.  Im Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Loom<P>

We're listening to a loom weaving yarn into fabric at Burlington Denim in North Carolina.  Burlington has developed a process called garnetting, which reverses the work of the loom, and turns denim back into it's original fiber.  As Darlene Ball, the Customer Service Director of the company explains, this cotton can then be recycled for many different applications.<P>

"The first application that we saw and we adopted was a method for turning this into paper.  So in the denim division, all of our paper, our stationery, and envelopes, and business cards, and so forth, are made of recycled denim.  Another company is using it in insulation.  Its been garnetted, taken back to the fiber form, and then has been formed into a thick insulation, which is being sold for housing."<P>

By reusing the cotton fibers, millions of pounds of denim can be rescued from the garbage dump.  And when the yarn is turned into recycled clothing, it also reduces the amount of cotton picked from the fields.<P>

"Another application which we have patented is going through the same process that we do today with 100% new cotton fiber, and you make fabric.  And then from that fabric, our customers can make jeans, or dresses, or skirts, or whatever they may want.  These jeans made of our fabric look exactly like other jeans.  You really would not be able to pick them up and know that they were from the reused or recycled yarn, because they have the same strength and the same characteristics."<P>

<CENTER>VITAL SIGNS MONITOR</CENTER>

The person sitting across the room points a small device at you, and a moment later, they know your vital signs.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

It sounds like a scene from "Star Trek," but it's true.  Ask Michael Burrow, a Senior Research Engineer at Georgia Tech, who's working on the vital signs monitor.  It's a radar-like device that measures a person's heart and breathing rates from hundreds of feet away.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Heartbeat<P>

"The device is a microwave device that sends a signal out and looks for movement of your chest as a result of your heart rate and your respiration.  And as your chest moves, this device records that movement, and provides a recording of your heartbeat as well as of your breathing."<P> 

"It was actually developed for military applications about 10 years ago.  And the idea was to be able to monitor from hundreds of yards away, a individual who's been wounded on the battlefield to determine whether they are still alive and whether you should risk the lives of other individuals to retrieve that individual."<P>

The monitor can also be used away from the battlefield in rescue operations.<P>  

"You could also think of situations in which you've had an earthquake and there's a lot of rubble, and you would like to search for individuals who might be buried in that rubble.  And such a device could actually look through the rubble and look for respiration of an individual who might be trapped."<P>

We'll hear more about the vital signs monitor in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>PLANT VACCINES -- Immunizing the World</CENTER>

People in developing countries may soon receive much needed vaccines, in the form of ripe bananas.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Charles Arntzen is the president of the Boyce-Thompson Institute for Plant Research.<P>

"Vaccines are probably the most cost effective health intervention that we know of.  Unfortunately, on a world wide basis, vaccines don't get to all the people that need them, especially children.  Under immunization is a major problem throughout the poor countries of the world where economically disadvantaged children don't get the vaccines that they need."<P>

"Sometimes there is a poor rate of compliance, that is use of vaccines among people, simply because it's inconvenient for them to get to a doctor's office where the vaccines are administered.  If it was possible to find an easier route for distribution of vaccines, I think more people would use them."<P>

To this end, Dr. Arntzen is developing an edible vaccine. He inserts a gene from a virus or bacteria into a plant such as an apple or banana.  The plant then produces a protein which is like a blueprint of that disease.  By eating the fruit, humans ingest this protein and are vaccinated against the illness.<P>

"Our primary focus has has been getting inexpensive vaccines for kids in the developing world, where convenience is going to be a factor.  It's our expectation that we're going to have to have a food crop that can be given to infants, so we've focused on bananas.  Bananas are often times the first food that's given to infants.  My picture of the way bananas would be used would be delivery in something like a baby food bottle.  Where an infant in this country or developing world could simply get a spoonful of this nice banana puree, and get a pharmaceutical at the same time."<P>

<CENTER>AUDITIONER -- Acoustic Predictor</CENTER>

It's now possible to know what the inside of a building will sound like, even before it's beenn constructed.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"Imagine how hard it would be to design the appearance of a building with a blindfold on.  Thats exactly the situation that weve had in the design of acoustics  since the beginning of time.  No one has used their ears to design the acoustics of spaces."<P>

Ken Jacob is Chief Engineer of Acoustic Research at Bose Corporation.  He's developed the Auditioner, a computer program that helps solve the problems of acoustic design.<P>

"In the most basic sense, Auditioner is a scale model for the ears.  In this case, that model exists in the computer.  Imagine yourself crawling inside of that model, sitting down at any seat that you choose, and experiencing sound that is the same as you would experience if that model were actually constructed."<P> 

Building plans are programmed into the Auditioner, taking into account materials which affect acoustics, such as carpeting or tiling.  The computer then uses this information to precisely reproduce how a location inside that structure will sound.  In other words, Auditioner lets you hear the inside of any building in the world, without ever leaving your chair.<P>

"We're gonna start in this church in Framingham, this 500 seat church.  This will sound like the minister were actually on the altar, speaking through a sound system in this church."<P>

<CENTER>AUDITIONER -- Listen Before You Build</CENTER>

The days of bad concert hall and meeting room acoustics may be over, thanks to a new acoustic design system called the Auditioner.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"There are hundreds of buildings that disappoint their designers and disappoint their owners when they finally open, because of the acoustics.  The problem has always been that when the design is finished, is the first time that anyone gets to use their ears, and by then it's too late."<P>

Ken Jacob is Chief Engineer of Acoustic Research at the Bose Corporation.  He's created the Auditioner, a computer system that allows designers to hear what the interior of a structure will sound like, before it's built.  When blueprints for a building are programmed into the system, the Auditioner can audibly reproduce the acoustics of that space.  Engineers can then try out design fixes on computer.<P>

"A good example is this large ballroom where I had to give a lecture to about 300 or 400 people and the problem was that when I was standing on the stage at the podium, there was such a terrible echo from the PA system that it was everything I could do to simply read the outline on the piece of paper in front of me.  And what I realized is that I could very easily fix this problem simply by using Auditioner."<P>

<B>FX</B> "Welcome to the podium.  You're standing beside me and we can both hear the public address system.  Can you imagine how hard it is to give a talk with this horrible echo?"<P>

The Auditioner demonstrates how the acoustics would change in this instance if a different loudspeaker was used and a curtain was added to the back wall.<P>

<B>FX</B> "You can hear that the sound has been dramatically improved.  I no longer have to put up with that horrible echo while I give my talk."<P>

<CENTER>FLU DETECTION</CENTER>

If you've ever been sick in bed with flu-like symptoms, chances are it wasnt really the flu at all.  But doctors may soon have a new way of finding out for sure.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"Well most people, when they say that they have the flu, they actually dont really have the flu.  They just have a pretty bad cold."<P>

Dr. Deborah Charych is a Principal Scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.<P>

"The flu means that you actually have an infection by the virus called the influenza virus.  If you really had flu, you'd be so sick, you cant even get out of bed to go to the bathroom.  You feel like you've been knocked over by a truck.  You can imagine a doctor, if there was a drug for flu, would probably prescribe this drug to someone who just had a cold, and it would be ineffective.  So it would be nice for a doctor to have a rapid diagnostic test for the actual case of flu."<P>

<B>ambience</B> Centrifuge<P>

That's the sound of a centrifuge preparing samples for a new test to diagnose the flu virus.  The key to this method of detection is a colored polymer solution.<P> 

"A polymer molecule is simply a bunch of molecules that are linked together.  Similar to the way people standing in a row might link arms.  And it's that polymer that gives the material its color."<P>

Dr. Charych tells us that the flu test uses a blue colored polymer solution. When the influenza virus is introduced to the solution, it binds to the polymer and changes the color.<P>

"When the virus binds, then you have this rippling effect. It now absorbs blue light and reflects red color.  We pick that up as a visible color change from blue to red."<P>

According to Dr. Charych, if doctors are able to diagnose the flu by simply watching a solution change color, they may be able to treat the disease more effectively.<P>

<CENTER>FLU DETECTION -- Applications</CENTER>

A new method of detecting the flu virus may lead to a new era of health care.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Plate Shaker<P>

That's the sound of a machine shaking up chemical samples at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where theyre perfecting a simple and easy method of detecting the flu.  As Dr. Deborah Charych, a Principal Scientist at the Laboratory explains, the virus is identified when it changes the color of a solution from blue to pink.<P>

"With the flu test, probably what would happen is you'd walk into the doctor's office, he would take a scraping from the back of your throat or from your nose, dissolve that scraping, and then wait a period of about fifteen minutes and just monitor the color change in the material and if he sees that it changed to pink, that would be a good indication that you had flu."<P>

According to Dr. Charych, this is an improvement over standard flu detecting methods, because it eliminates the potentially deadly time lag before a diagnosis.<P>

"Right now what's done is a throat swab or a nasal swab from a patient is taken and you basically run a cell culture.  And usually that test takes three to five days."<P>

"For certain compromised populations, for example in a nursing home, if there's an outbreak of flu, you could lose a lot of people rather quickly.  So you'd want to be able to know that it is in fact a case of influenza so that you can begin treatment right away and prevent the disease from spreading."<P>

With any luck, this new flu test can lead to easier methods for detecting other diseases.<P>

"Right now we're looking at detecting other bacterial systems.  For example, strep would be one, or chlamydia, or gonorrhea, different sexually transmitted diseases.  Perhaps other viral systems such as HIV virus would be another one that would probably benefit from a rapid diagnostic.  And in some cases it might be desirable to have even a home type of test that might signal whether you should go see a doctor."<P>

<CENTER>FLU DETECTION -- Beyond the Flu</CENTER>

A new test may make diagnosing the flu easier than ever, and it may also help us to prevent other illnesses.  Im Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Plate Shaker<P>

Were in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories, listening to equipment preparing samples for a new test used to identify the flu virus.  When perfected, the test will simplify and speed up detection of influenza.  It works by mixing a tissue sample with a chemical solution.  If the flu virus is present, it will bond with the molecules in the solution, changing its color from blue to pink.  As Dr. Deborah Charych, a Principal Scientist at the Laboratory explains, the test isn't perfect yet.<P>

"Right now we need to have a lot of viruses to bind that material to change the color.  So as a visual test, the sensitivity could be improved.  There might be other organisms or other viruses out there that bind to the same target.  No biological test is going to be perfectly selective for what you're looking at."<P>

But even with the drawbacks, this type of test has other applications.  For one, it may be used to detect when disease causing organisms are trapped in enclosed spaces, the so-called sick-building syndrome.<P>

"It's believed that some cases of sick building syndrome are caused by bacteria or fungi in the air, and it would be nice if you could have some kind of an on-line monitoring system in a room or on a filter that would indicate well the air is getting bad.  So any kind of closed environment life an office environment, or an airplane, or a waiting room of a hospital might be places where you'd want to continuously monitor the air.  It might be useful for just monitoring, you know, the cleanliness of your home for example, if you were interested to make sure there weren't any microbes or airborne organisms in the house that might potentially  cause allergies or disease."<P>

<CENTER>WIRELESS SUBWAY SPEAKERS</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Subway Station<P>
<B>FX</B> Garbled Subway Announcement<P>
If youve ever been in a subway station, youve heard announcements like that.  But thanks to a new wireless public address system, we may be able to look forward to understandable subway messages.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"The system we have designed is called WAVES, which stands for Wireless Audio Visual and Emergency System."<P>

Dr. Alan Avidan is the Executive Vice President of the MadahCom Corporation, where they've developed a public address system that uses digital technology to deliver clearer messages than traditional PA systems.<P>

"Public address announcements in general sound unintelligible because the analog signal degrades along the wire and picks up interference and hum.  What makes the problem worse is that speakers are often placed where the wires are, and not where the sound is best.  The WAVES system solves this problem, because it's wireless, which means that you can place the speakers where the sound is best, and it's digital so that the signal doesn't degrade and the output is clean and clear without any interference."<P>

Using special radio signals, a WAVES transmitter sends announcements to receivers attached to speakers throughout the station.<P>

"The WAVES system uses state of the art digital radio, that converts voice and music into a data stream, and sends it via radio signal.  It's a frequency hopping system, which means that all the WAVES units change frequencies hundreds of times a second.  You can avoid any interference that's out there by skipping channels that have interference in them."<P>

So instead of hearing:<P>
<B>FX</B> Garbled Subway Transfer Announcement<P>

You'll now hear:<P>
<B>FX</B> WAVES Announcement "This is 59th Street, Columbus Circle.  Transfer here for the A, C, B, D, 1 or the 9 train."<P>

<CENTER>WIRELESS SUBWAY SPEAKERS -- Safety</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> subway station, train stopping<P>
You're riding along on the subway, when the train suddenly grinds to a halt.  You nervously sit awaiting instructions, when the public address system crackles to life with an undecipherable message.<P>

<B>FX</B> Garbled subway message<P>

I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"It's very important to design a new public address system, because of public safety.  PA systems are vital information sources, especially during an emergency.  Conventional PA systems often collapse just at those critical moments."<P>

Dr. Alan Avidan is the Executive Vice President of the MadahCom Corporation.  He's developed a wireless public address system that sends announcements via digital radio signals to strategically placed receivers.  According to Dr. Avidan, this technology greatly improves the clarity of the messages, and increases the system's reliability during an emergency.<P>

"Even if parts of it collapse, the rest of the system continues to operate."<P> 

And the WAVES system can also use a computer to send digital data signals to its receivers.  This data can carry visual information for a lighted sign, which would provide emergency messages to hearing-impaired individuals.<P>

"The data channel's used to display text and animation on visual display signs which can be synchronized with the audio.  It provides a significant quality-of-life improvement to hearing-impaired people.  I can tag a visual message and an audio message and send them with the single flick of a key."<P>

"I think the WAVES product makes our lives safer by providing us reliable, timely, audio and visual information where we need it and when we need it during emergency situations."<P>

<CENTER>AIRCRAFT NOISE REDUCTION</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Flying jet airplane </P>
We've all heard the roar of a jet engine, but in the future it might not be so loud.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Ian Waitz is the Director of the MIT Aero-Environmental Research Laboratory, where scientists are studying ways to reduce the noise of aircraft engines.<P>

"Airplane noise is something that's felt by more and more people, because more and more people live near airports, and airports are having more and more traffic, so there's more and more overflights.  So, it can impact ability to work, ability to have conversations, ability to sleep at night, which can influence you in a variety of ways."<P>

Aircraft noise is caused by unsteady air flow from the engine's fan.  This unstable air creates a wake, similar to the waves you see behind a boat.  When that reaches our ears, we hear it as noise.  Prof. Waitz wants to quiet the engines by reducing the wake.<P>

"What we do is we take high pressure air from the compressor in the engine, and we pass this air up through the center of this rotating set of hollow fan blades, and then out through the back of these fan blades.  And when we push the air out through the back of these fan blades, that fills in the wake.  And if we can fill in the wake, we can reduce the noise associated with the interaction of that wake.<P>

If this technology works, it will mean a notable improvement in the sound of aircraft.<P>

"Roughly, it might be like the difference between standing very close to a major highway as the cars go by, and then standing many tens of feet back from that highway, in terms of the change in the sound you might see.  So it's a step in the right direction."<P>

<CENTER>AIRCRAFT NOISE REDUCTION -- Tests</CENTER>

The roar of airplanes may soon be quieted, thanks to tests now being conducted by scientists.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Ian Waitz is the Director of the MIT Aero-Environmental Research Laboratory, where scientists are trying to design a new way to reduce the noise level of jet engines.<P>

"One of the major reductions in aircraft noise which has occurred over the last twenty years has been basically a change in engine design.  Aircraft engine designers with the tools they currently have, have done just about everything that they can do.  And yet, there's continual push from communities to further reduce aircraft noise."<P>

<B>ambience</B> Vacuum pump<P>

We're listening to a vacuum pump preparing a test in Prof. Waitz's research facility.  As he explains, it's used to gather information from a simulated jet engine.<P> 

"What we're looking at here are two large tanks that are connected by a pipe.  And in that pipe are two things.  One is a valve, and the other is a rotating set of fan blades, very similar to what you would see on the front of a jet engine.  In one tank we have a very high-pressure mixture of and argon, and in the other tank we have vacuum.  The way we operate this facility is by spinning up this set of fan blades with a small electric motor, until we reach about 7000 revolutions per minute."<P>

<B>ambience</B> Fan noise test -- blades spinning<P>

"And when we've hit just the right speed, we open the valve, and that allows the air to flow between the two tanks."<P>
  
<B>ambience</B> Fan noise test -- pop of valve opening<P>

"It takes roughly 100 milliseconds for the air to go from the high pressure tank to the low pressure tank.  And in that 100 milliseconds, we can collect a great deal of data that very closely simulates the conditions in the jet engine."<P>

Prof. Waitz can then use this data to find a method of reducing noise in real engines.<P>

<CENTER>BACTERIAL IDENTIFICATION</CENTER>

Bar codes have become a standard item in the design of grocery packaing.  Now scientists have developed a technology similar to bacteria in order to catalog bacteria.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Riboprinter<P>
 
Youre hearing a machine called a Riboprinter, a kind of a grocery scanner for micro-organisms, which automatically identifies any bacteria sample presented to it.  Dr. A. J. McCardell is a microbiologist with the Qualicon Company.<P>

"The Riboprinter System works by taking bacterial cells, breaking open those cells, very much like cracking an egg, to get at the genetic material.  It cuts the genetic material and produces a genetic fingerprint from the bacterial DNA.  A genetic fingerprint looks very much like a bar code that you would see on a package of food, and it can be used to specifically identify a bacterium."<P>

The genetic fingerprint is stored in the computer's database, so that the Riboprinter will always be able to distinguish that particular organism.  According to Dr. McCardell, this is a significant improvement over previous methods of identifying bacteria.<P>

"The standard way of typing bacteria is to use biochemicals.  Biochemical methods are very slow.  It can take as much as a week or more in order to get a name for a bacterium."<P>

Dr. McCardell says that the Riboprinter classifies organisms not only more quickly, but more precisely.<P>

"Using a genetic method, we are able to actually identify and characterize the bacteria to a much, much finer level than was ever possible before. And it does it in eight hours."<P>

<CENTER>BACTERIAL IDENTIFICATION -- Cleaner Foods</CENTER>

There's a new way to identify bacteria which may lead to safer foods for everyone.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Riboprinter<P>

That's the sound of the Riboprinter, a computerized device used to identify and catalog bacteria.  It creates a genetic fingerprint, or a kind of bar code for each organism.  The fingerprint is stored in a database so that the bacteria can always be specifically identified.  Dr. A. J. McCardell, a microbiologist at the DuPont Experimental Station, explains one of the applications of the Riboprinter.<P>

"The instrument is being used today in part in the food industry, to track contamination and spoilage issues in their products.  For example, we had a particular customer that had contamination of a final product.  They were able to identify the bacterium in the food with a name.  They found the same kind of bacteria on a worker's hands, as well as in one of the raw materials that went into producing the product."<P>

Now if the bacteria had come from the raw materials, it would mean that the process used to decontaminate the food didn't work.  However, in this instance, by using the Riboprinter, it was discovered that the bacteria actually came from dirty hands after the food had been decontaminated.<P>

"We were able to find an exact genetic match between the patterns of bacteria isolated on the worker's hands and in the final product.  And the pattern found from the raw material was completely different.  Their processing steps in producing the food were working.  It was a lot simpler for them to target specifically new hand washing procedures, mandatory glove wearing procedures, in the final post-processing handling of their product."<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER VOICE SIMULATION</CENTER>

<B>FX</B> Computer arpeggio<P>

That's the voice of a computer singing to you through its own virtual voice box, and although Luciano Pavarotti is in no danger of being replaced here, the computer may help us understand better the mechanics of singing.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

At the University of Iowa, scientists have designed a computerized version of the human speech system.  Dr. Brad Story, an Assistant Research Scientist, used MRI technology to record images of his vocal tract.  These images, combined with mathematical formulas, were then used to create a digital, three dimensional model of his vocal apparatus, with which the computer can then recreate his voice.<P>  

How close does it come?  Well, this is Dr. Story speaking.<P>

<B>FX</B> Recorded Sentence "The blue spot is on the key again."<P>

And this is the sound of the computer simulating his speech with its virtual vocal tract.<P>

<B>FX</B> Simulated Sentence "The blue spot is on the key again."<P>

Dr. Story says that one application of the voice simulator is to study how singers produce certain sounds.<P>

"We've done quite a bit of investigating how the shaping of the vocal tract can enhance different singers voices.  There have long been a lot of methods that voice teachers will tell a student how to get a particular sound.  Like, to make it feel like there's a baseball in the back of your throat or something, that gets them to open up their pharynx.  We're able to go in now and actually open up the pharynx in that part and find out if that, in fact, does enhance the voice."<P>

Dr. Story can test these ideas using the model of his own vocal tract.<P>

"I'm not at all a trained singer, so what you're going to hear is something that I personally can't do, but I can make the computer do it for me.  And what you're going to hear is a little arpeggio, done with the 'ah' vowel."<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER VOICE SIMULATION -- Simulated Surgery</CENTER>

How do you predict the effects of surgery on a person's voice?  Well, try using a computer armed with a model of a voice box.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>FX</B> simulated sentences<P>

Thats a computer recreating a human voice. Using mathematical formulas and actual images of a person's vocal tract, scientists have created a three dimensional, digital version of our speech apparatus.  Dr. Brad Story, an Assistant Research Scientist at the University of Iowa, explains how this virtual vocal system can be used.<P>

"The fundamental goal of all of the work we're doing is simply to create a very effective model of the human speech production system, and once we've got to that point, we can begin to do a lot of spin-off applications, one of the most important being that it becomes a very effective research tool, in that we can do a lot of things to a speech production model that we can't do to the human during speech."<P>

"We're hoping to go in and simulate a surgery prior to it being done, and hopefully be able to predict the results.  For example, if someone has one vocal fold that is paralyzed, which is called a unilateral vocal fold paralysis, surgeries are often done now where the vocal fold is bulked up and pushed one side to the other.  And we hope to be able to allow them to simulate that surgery prior to them actually making the cut in the person."<P>

<CENTER>LANDFILL GENERATOR</CENTER>

If you thought that landfills just took up space, it turns out that they can also be used to produce electricity.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

</B>ambience</B> Gas Compressor<P>

That's the sound of a gas compressor at a landfill in Groton, Connecticut, where the Environmental Protection Agency and Northeast Utilities have put a cap on the landfill to create a prototype of a power generator.  Chuck Trippell, the Project Engineer, explains how it works.<P>

"All landfills produce gas through the decomposition of the garbage.  And the gas either escapes into the atmosphere, or in cases where the landfill is capped, the gas is then collected to be used in the fuel cell."<P>

"A fuel cell is a piece of equipment that takes methane out of natural gas, or in this case landfill gas, which is about fifty percent methane.  It uses that gas to generate electricity through an electrochemical process.  The fuel cell is connected to the utility grid, so the electricity gets used like any other electricity on the grid would get used."<P>

Fuel cells are a nearly pollution-free way of producing electricity.  They also help the environment by reducing the amount of methane emitted from the landfill.  Traditionally, that gas is burned off with a device called a flare.  But flaring off methane into the atmosphere contributes to global warming.  By using that gas to make electricity, the generator reduces the pollution released into the air.<P>

"On a daily basis, approximately 300-400 cubic feet per minute of gas is flared off.  When the fuel cell is in operation, it will use approximately 80 cubic feet per minute of gas.  We're taking that gas and converting it to electricity, so we're saving that pollution that would normally escape into the atmosphere."<P>

<CENTER>BARRIER PLASTICS</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> soda pouring, fizzing<P>
Anyone who's ever opened a bottle of soda knows that sound.  But why is it that even unopened plastic soda bottles lose their fizz over time?  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"The carbon dioxide that gives soda what people normally associate with as fizz is soluble and will dissolve into the wall of the plastic and be transported through the plastic and escape.  In much the same way that air in your tires will eventually escape and the tire pressure goes down with time."<P>

Benny Freeman is an Associate Professor of chemical engineering at North Carolina State University.  He's been studying the effectiveness of plastic packaging.<P>

"Any plastic will permit leakage of small molecules through the plastic.  The current packaging materials for things like soda bottles have leak rates that are acceptable for large sizes, but become unacceptable  for smaller size bottles or for applications like beer packaging which are more sensitive to things like oxygen coming in from the outside of the package."<P>

And that's why you don't currently see beer packaged in plastic containers.<P>

"For an application like beer where beer is very very sensitive to even small amounts of oxygen, the major factor limiting the use of plastic packaging for beer is that oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere gets into the package and causes the beer to get stale or taste flat."<P>

But Professor Freeman and his colleagues are on the track of using new kinds of plastic which form more effective barriers.  We'll hear more in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>BARRIER PLASTICS - Better Packaging</CENTER>

Soda packaged in plastic bottles will ultimately lose its fizz, as the carbon dioxide gas leaks through the container.  But new kinds of plastic should make a difference.   I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Pump/trap<P>

That's the sounds the sound of a device used to measure how well different kinds of plastic serve as a barrier to gases like carbon dioxide.<P>

"This electro-balance is a very sensitive set of scales that we can use to measure very small changes in the weight of the sample.  From these data we can calculate how much of the gas has dissolved into the plastic, and we can also calculate how rapidly it dissolves into the plastic.  Those two values, for example, how rapidly these gases would permeate through a piece of plastic."<P>

Benny Freeman is an Associate Professor of chemical engineering at North Carolina State University.   He says the plastics he's working with are fundamentally different from the materials used in making soda bottles.<P>

"The molecular structure of the materials we work with, the molecules are much straighter and more elongated than the molecules that are used for the current packaging materials.  So the molecules pack together in much the same way that tooth picks in a box pack together very efficiently.  The plastics we deal with look like molecular toothpicks.  And they align so that all of the molecules are pointing in the same direction.  This very efficient packing markedly reduces the rate of transport of gases across plastics, so it markedly reduces for example, the rate of the loss of carbon dioxide from soda bottles."<P>

<CENTER>BARRIER PLASTICS - Applications</CENTER>

New kinds of plastics will make better containers and make possible a wide range of new applications.   I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

A polymer is a plastic, and liquid crystal polymers are better at containing gasses and other substances than common plastics.<P>

"Gasoline tanks are made out of plastic bottles."<P>

Benny Freeman is an Associate Professor of chemical engineering at North Carolina State University.<P>  

"Some of these materials could be used to improve the barrier properties of gasoline tanks.  What that does is keep the gasoline in the tank rather than let it escape to the atmosphere and cause a pollution problem."<P>

"They're likely to be used what are called a composite structure.  That is, there will be a very thin layer of these extremely high barrier materials and it will be sandwiched by layers of much less expensive plastics, to bring the cost of the total structure down to a reasonable level, but still give you much better barrier properties than you would get with just the less expensive material alone."<P>

"The military  is looking at these kinds of materials to make all-plastic rockets and missiles, which in addition to having obvious advantages in terms of weight over metal components, it also makes them much more difficult to detect by radar.  A lot of this technology will be applied in space.  NASA all ready uses some of these materials in the breathing system for their next generation of spacesuits."<P>

"We are, I think at the beginning of really understanding where you can start to manipulate structure and actually control properties in these materials.  There's still a lot of uncharted territory in the science of these materials."<P>

<CENTER>THE SEARCH FOR GAS HYDRATES</CENTER>

Scientists have discovered that abundant pockets of methane gas are buried below the ocean floor.  Now, they are developing new ways to locate and extract that natural gas, using sound.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

William Dillon is a scientist at Wood's Hole Geological Survey, who's researching gas hydrates, crystallized methane gas found beneath the ocean floor.<P>

"A gas hydrate is an ice-like material.  It's a crystalline form of water molecules just like ice, but the crystal structure is held open by the presence of a gas molecule within the structure, generally a methane molecule.  Gas hydrate is found in many places, but most commonly within the deep sea sediments."<P>

A new device to help locate gas hydrates in the ocean's bottom, by first recreating them in the lab.<P>

<B>ambience</B> GHASTLI<P>

"Thats the hydraulic power system going on for an instrument known as GHASTLI--Gas Hydrate and Sediment Test Laboratory Instrument.  The intention of this instrument is to recreate conditions within deep sea sediments where gas hydrates exist.  We inject water and methane, and when conditions are correct, we can form gas hydrate."<P> 

When scientists bounce sound waves off the ocean floor, it gives them  a kind of map or profile of the sediment below.  Now, gas hydrates, which are buried in deep sea sediments, can be located by this method, but first scientists need to identify their acoustic fingerprint.  And that's what Mr. Dillon and his colleagues are trying to do in the laboratory.<P>

We'll hear more about extracting methane from the ocean in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>GAS HYDRATES AND THE ENVIRONMENT</CENTER>

The most abundant source of natural methane gas might be lying deep beneath the ocean floor, and it could be a chief cause of global warming.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> seismic profile

We're on board a research ship in the Atlantic, bouncing sound waves off the ocean floor to create a seismic profile, a kind of acoustic map of the sea bottom.  William Dillon is a scientist at Woods Hole Geological Survey.<P> 

"A seismic profile is created by firing a seismic source, and then listening to the returning echoes.  The rumble is the reflections from the sea floor and from layers beneath the sea floor."<P>

Mr. Dillon uses seismic profiles to locate gas hydrates, which are crystallized molecules of methane gas found at the bottom of the ocean.<P> 

"Gas hydrates are ice-like materials found within ocean floor sediments. They are formed out of methane molecules and water molecules.  The water is frozen into a crystalline state and the methane molecules are held within the water crystal framework."<P>

The undersea methane gas might be one of the hidden causes of global warming.<P>

"Gas hydrates probably have a strong influence on deep sea landslides.  The hydrate actually glues sediment together, and when it breaks down it can cause landslides on the sea floor.  Now, landslides on the sea floor might not sound too for humanity, but sea floor landslides can cause massive release of methane to the atmosphere. Release of methane to the atmosphere will have a contribution to the greenhouse effect.  So the breakdown of gas hydrates on the sea floor can cause a warming of the planet, probably a significant one."<P>

<CENTER>GAS HYDRATES - Energy for the Future</CENTER>

The sea is full of wonders.  One of them, buried beneath the ocean floor, could be a solution to the Earths energy problems.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> ocean waves<P>

"The amount of methane in the ocean sediments is immense. One conservative estimate suggests that the amount of methane is twice as much as the amount in all fossil fuels on earth."<P> 

Buried in the sea floor, gas hydrates are deposits of crystallized methane.  William Dillon, a scientist at the Wood's Hole Geological Survey, studies these packets of potential underwater energy.<P>

"Gas hydrates are ice-like materials that form out of water molecules.  But unlike ice, which is the same sort of thing, a gas hydrate has a gas molecule stuffed into its crystal structure, generally methane.  Gas hydrates look exactly like ice.  The only thing that's different about them is that if you struck a match, this ice would burn."<P>

"Gas hydrate will form wherever temperature and pressure conditions are suitable for them to form.  You can't stop it from forming.  So whenever the pressure is moderately high and the temperature is moderately low and the gas and water are available, you'll form gas hydrates."<P>

Gas hydrates may offer a new source of fuel for countries around the world.<P>

"Obviously the methane in the hydrate could be extracted and used as fuel.  Methane is natural gas and it can just be burned using the systems we have in place.  Any country that has an oceanic boundary is liable to have gas hydrate deposits.  If methane was extracted from these deposits, certainly that could change the international energy picture immensely, and perhaps reduce dependence on the Middle Eastern petroleum.  It could be a very significant fuel for the future."<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER-AIDED DRIVING - The Future of Commuting</CENTER>

You climb into your car after a hard day's of work, turn on the ignition, and then sit back and relax as it drives you home.  It's a scenario that could happen in the not too distant future.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"One of the biggest problems that our nation faces today is the congestion problem on our nations highways.  So a computerized vehicle that can steer itself and also control its own speed would allow you to pack more cars and allow them to travel more quickly because the computer can react more quickly."<P>

<B>ambience</B> RALPH<P>

Dean Pomerleau is a research scientist at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, where they're developing a self-steering car.  It uses a computerized driving system called the Rapidly Adapting Lateral Position Handler, or RALPH, for short.  It monitors lane markings through a video camera to maintain the car's position on the road.  Dr. Pomerleau's next step is to put driving completely in the hands of the vehicle.<P>

"One of the goals of the work we're doing here is to develop these fully automated cars.  That you'd pull onto a potentially special lane of the highway  and hit a button, take your hands and feet off the wheels and the pedals, sit back and read your newspaper while it whisks you to work."<P>

It sounds promising, but there are drawbacks.<P>

"One potential danger of this kind of system is that the driver will become reliant on it and not be attentive to themselves to in this case the driving task.  One of the important attributes that the RALPH system has, is it's ability to estimate its own competence, basically, for driving in a particular situation.  It will tell the driver that is incapable of performing at this point in time."<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER-AIDED DIVING - RALPH</CENTER>

A new automated system may make driving a lot easier, by taking the job of steering away from the driver.  That system's name is RALPH.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> RALPH<P>

"RALPH stands for Rapidly Adapting Lateral Position Handler."<P>

Dean Pomerleau is a research scientist at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, where they have developed RALPH, one day it may help steer your car.<P>

"We've got a video camera mounted next to the rear view mirror that looks out ahead of the vehicle at the road.  Images from that video camera are processed by a computer in the trunk of the car to determine where the road is ahead and how the vehicle is situated on the road. It tries to find features that are running parallel to the roadway.  So for instance lane markings are nice parallel features that it tries to locate in the image ahead and use the position of those features to estimate the vehicle's location on the roadway."<P>

A prototype of RALPH has all ready been field tested by Dr. Pomerleau.<P>

(p.8, 331) "Over the summer, myself and one of my graduate students took a trip in our test vehicle from Washington DC to San Diego, California.  During the 2850 mile trip, the system, RALPH, was actually in control and steering the vehicle 98.2% of the trip.  We basically just sat back and watched RALPH drive.  Situations where we had to take over were things like stretches of new highway where they hadn't bothered to paint line markings on it yet, or going into the setting sun with the sun shining directly into the camera."<P>

As of now, RALPH only controls a vehicle's steering, but if a speed-control system is developed, RALPH may change the face of commuting forever.<P>

<CENTER>BIO-DIESEL</CENTER>

If the exhaust from that truck in front of you smells a bit like French fries, you may not be imagining it.  That truck could be running on a type of diesel fuel made from vegetable oil.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Bio-diesel powered truck starts<P>

The vehicle youre hearing is running on bio-diesel fuel.  As Leon Schumacher, an Associate Professor at the University of Missouri explains, bio-diesel is an engine fuel derived the same type of oils used for making French fries.<P>

"The bio-diesel that we're using in the diesel engines is made from soy bean oil. We remove the glycerin from the oil, and by so doing, we have a product that is very similar to petroleum diesel fuel."<P>

"This fuel can be used to power boats, cars, trucks, trains.  It's even been tested in aircraft engines.  So it's got a wide variety of uses and it's very well suited in any application where you would normally operate with petroleum diesel fuel."<P>

Though its seems remarkably innovative, bio-diesel actually first appeared many years ago.<P>

"The very first to power diesel engines with a plant based product was in fact the inventor of the diesel engine: Rudolph Diesel.  He used peanut oil to power the diesel engine in the Paris Exposition when he first introduced the diesel engine. The real difference is that today we're using a product that is very similar to modern petroleum diesel fuel.  And because it is so similar the product requires little if any changes to the fueling system of the engine.  The advantage being you can simply move ahead and use the engine on diesel fuel as well as on the bio-diesel."<P>

We'll hear more about bio-diesel fuel in future programs.<P>

Soy beans are found in food products from corn chips to tofu.  But now, they may also be found inside your fuel tank.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Bio-diesel Truck<P>

"We have a Dodge pick-up that's been operating for approximately 96,000 miles on a what we call bio-diesel."<P>    

Leon Schumacher is an Associate Professor at the University of Missouri.  His truck is running on a fuel that's made entirely from soy beans.<P>  

"Bio-diesel is actually a product where we take soy bean oil and remove a product called glycerin from it.  And the end result is a fuel that's very similar to diesel fuel and it's operating in a direct-injected diesel engine."<P>

According to Professor Schumacher, an engine runs just as well on the purely organic bio-diesel as it would on traditional petroleum-diesel.  But the bio-diesel out-performs petroleum in other ways.<P>

"Bio-diesel actually facilitates the combustion process and actually reduces many of the undesirable pollutants that are caused by today's fuels."<P>

"Another advantage of the bio-diesel is that its a biodegradable product. For example, a lot of work that the forest service gets caught up in, they have no other option then to use hand tools because certain parts of the area where they are working will not permit them to use any kind of product that if spilled would cause damage to the ecosystem."<P>

Bio-diesel would allow forest workers to use power tools, while minimizing the effects of harmful fuel spills.  We'll hear more about the benefits of bio-diesel in future programs.<P>

Perhaps the most sensible fuel for the world's diesel engines isn't found  buried in the ground, but growing on top of it.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Bio-diesel Tractor<P>

The tractor you're listening to runs on a fuel made from soy beans.  A substance called glycerin is extracted from the soy bean oil, turning the oil into an efficient petroleum substitute.  As Leon Schumacher, a scientist at the University of Missouri explains, this bio-diesel fuel holds in store many benefits for the future.<P>

"The United States consumes approximately 60 billion gallons diesel fuel each year.  When we pull oil reserves out of the ground, we're not able to put that kind of product back into the ground for future generations to remove for their needs."<P>

Bio-diesel fuel solves this problem because, unlike petroleum, the soy beans used to make bio-diesel can be constantly regenerated.<P>

"The product we're using is something that we can grow.  Which indirectly means that we're reserving some of the petroleum product for a future generation."<P>

So why isn't the public already using bio-diesel?<P>

"The only real downside to the product is the cost issue.  The bio-diesel today is being sold for approximately four dollars and fifty cents per gallon.  This, obviously, is much higher than what we're paying for petroleum diesel fuel."<P>

Scientists are now experimenting with bio and petroleum diesel blends, to help lower the cost of the fuel.<P>

<CENTER>ALUMINUM CAR</CENTER>


A new combination of sport and safety can now be achieved in cars, by manufacturing them out of aluminum.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Car racing around street<P>
 
French designers have manufactured a new sports car with an entirely aluminum chassis.  Marcial Hetier is the Chief Engineer of the Renault Spider.<P>

"It's made in aluminum to save weight and to have something more rigid, more stiff.  It's the first time weve built a complete chassis made in aluminum. This process is a very common process for the building industry, but for a car its a new thing."<P>

Aluminum absorbs impacts one and a half times better than the steel generally used in cars.  That translates into improved safety for drivers.<P>

"We have a crash box at the front of the car to absorb all the energy of the crash.   It's completely stiff and protects the passenger of any crash."<P>

But that doesn't mean that the Aluminum car can't be sporty.<P> 

<B>ambience</B> Car racing around street<P>

Because aluminum is such a light weight metal, the Spider performs much better than most sports cars.<P>

"The car accelerates very quickly.  The brakes are fantastic.  This car corners much quicker than any other car in the world. It's completely stable and glued on the road."<P>

<CENTER>SYNTHETIC DIAMONDS</CENTER>

Diamonds have long been considered one of the Earths most precious substances, and now they can be grown in the laboratory.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"Natural diamonds are made at very, very high pressures and heat.  Basically it's a natural occurring process that literally took millennia to form the diamond.  We make diamonds in a couple of minutes here."<P>

James Adair is an Associate Professor of Material Science and Engineering at the University of Florida.  He uses a process called chemical vapor deposition to grow diamonds in a laboratory.  The process begins with tiny diamond fragments called seeds.<P>

<B>ambience<B> heat exchanger<P>
"We take very very fine diamond particles and we make them stick to all kinds of different surfaces on which we wish to lay down diamond.  And then the chemical vapor deposition process grows diamond from those seeds."<P>

Unlike  other methods for making synthetic diamonds, the process that professor Adair uses requires no extraneous equipment or electronics.  But even though these diamonds are easy enough to create, you won't be finding them adorning engagement rings.<P>    

"We're limited to diamond coatings or films on various surfaces.  This particular sample's got a diamond coating on it.  It's about point one thousandths of an inch thick.  It basically looks like a piece of sandpaper."<P>

"Diamond has many more attractive engineering properties actually than aesthetic properties.  When you look at this kind of diamond, hopefully all the romance goes out the window and people will think of it as something that can potentially revolutionize their lives."<P>

We'll hear more about the uses of synthetic diamonds in future programs.  Pulse of the Planet is presented by DuPont, makers of better things for better living.<P>

<CENTER>SYNTHETIC DIAMONDS - The Key to Computing</CENTER>

Scientists can now create diamonds in the laboratory.  But they wont be found in jewelry.  These diamonds will end up inside of tomorrow's high speed computers.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

James Adair is an Associate Professor at the University of Florida.  Hes developed a way to create diamonds in the laboratory.  A simple chemical process is used to grow the gems from tiny diamond fragments.  The results are microscopic, but they have important scientific applications.<P>

"Diamond is, of course as you know, one of the hardest materials known to man.  But also it's got the highest thermoconductivity of any material.  What this means is that it transports heat very, very effectively.  You wouldn't want a diamond camping cup, because it would warm up very, very rapidly as a container and so you'd burn your lips."<P>

But the diamonds ability to conduct heat makes them very useful if installed in silicon computer chips.<P>

"For microelectronics, dealing with the heat generated by the circuit is one of the biggest problems.  If the heat builds up too much within a silicon circuit, it can literally melt the silicon.  And it's not going to act as a very good computer brain for you.  Diamond can pull that heat out of the silicon chip, so the circuit can run a little bit cooler."<P>

If a computer chip is kept from heating up, it can be made to perform faster.  And a faster chip can lead to a new breed of computers with enhanced capabilities.<P>

"Based on diamonds, we'll have computers so fast that true voice recognition is possible.  You say 'Computer, I want you to write a program about this topic.'  And so the computer will write the program.  I think it'll be certainly before the end of our lifetimes, much closer than that.  I think diamond will play a big roll."<P>

<CENTER>PLANT VACCINES</CENTER>

We've all been inoculated against various diseases, and soon, we may be able to receive those same vaccinations by eating a piece of fruit.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Charles Arntzen is President of the Boyce-Thompson Institute for Plant Research.<P>

"In 1992, the Children's Vaccine Initiative put forth a manifesto and called for new technology for worldwide immunization of children against important infectious diseases.  When my colleagues and I read about this, we said 'We've got technology available in the plant sciences which is not being used.  Let's see if it would work.'"<P>

<B>ambience</B> lab<P>
We're in the laboratory at the Boyce-Thompson Institute, where edible vaccines are being developed.  To understand how they work, here's how a typical vaccine does its job:<P>

"Weakened or chemically damaged viruses or bacteria are injected into people.  Our immune system sees them and responds.  Because they've been weakened, they can't cause disease, and so we build up an immunity so the next time we see the real disease causing agent we don't get sick."<P>

The difference with Dr. Arntzen's vaccines is that they're not injected.  They're genetically reproduced in a plant, such as a banana.  You're inoculated by simply eating the fruit.<P>

"We take a gene from a bacterium or a virus that causes human disease.  We're putting the gene into a plant.  In the plant, the gene then causes a protein to be produced, and this protein is something like a fingerprint of the disease causing agent. The plant will start producing it in its edible tissues and we can now feed it and use it as an oral vaccine.  Once our body sees this fingerprint protein, it then causes us to mount an immune response and so we develop a defense mechanism against the entire disease causing agent."<P>

<B>ambience</B> cranking<P>

That's the sound of a wind-up radio - a radio that generates its own power, just by cranking it up. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

We're in Capetown, South Africa, speaking with John Hutchinson, general manager of Baygen Engineering, makers of the Freeplay radio.<P>

"The way that the free play radio works is that you wind it up, it takes sixty turns to give it a full charge.  What it's really doing is winding up a spring.  As the spring unwinds it spins a little generator providing about three volts of energy and it uses that energy to power a radio board.  The radio board is FM, medium wave and short wave and it enables the listener to pick up signals from all over the world, even thousands of miles away."<P>

"Not only does the Freeplay radio avoid the need of having to buy batteries, but it's an ecologically friendly radio.  I understand that batteries are the single biggest mercury pollutant on the planet today, and the fact that the Baygen radio doesn't use batteries will obviously have an effect on mercury pollution in the future."<P>

<CENTER>WINDUP RADIO--The World Tunes In</CENTER>

You're out camping in the wilderness, with a portable radio but no batteries.  Not to worry - a few cranks of the knob on the side of the radio generates enough power to play the radio for thirty minutes at a time. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> cranking<P>

"The concept was really to take communication to people who have never had radio receivers before.  Generally that's been because either there's been no electricity there or he price of batteries in remote regions is so dramatic that it's impossible for somebody to afford them."<P>

John Hutchinson is general manager of Baygen Engineering in Capetown, South Africa, makers of the Freeplay radio.  Just crank it up and it will receive AM, FM, and shortwave signals.<P>

<B>ambience</B> cranking, radio (music/voices)<P>

"I think the importance of the Baygen radio is not restricted to communications in rural South Africa.  It really has a role to play in communications throughout the world.  In fact currently we have one playing in the Amazon jungle, and Amazonian Indians travel enormous distances each day to come and listen to the radio in the evening.  Because it's been the first device of it's kind that's been able to bring continuous listening to that part of the world.  The guys just come in, wind it up, and listen to the Voice of America or the BBC or the voice of Moscow or listen to music from a medium wave station a couple of hundred miles away in the Amazon."<P>

The Freeplay radio is currently distributed in Africa and Europe, and soon will be available in the US.  The Company has plans for making windup flashlights and  windup cellular phones.<P>

<CENTER>T-RAYS</CENTER>

Between microwave and infrared radiation, there is a range of high frequency radiation called Terahertz, or T-waves.  Scientists are beginning to work with T-Waves to find safe new ways to inspect and analyze materials.  In some applications, they might someday replace X-rays.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Martin Nuss is with Bell Laboratories' Lucent Technologies.<P>

"To generate T-rays, we have to have optics, and very fast laser pulses help us."<P>

The sounds we're listening to are of the T-wave pulses translated to a frequency that humans can hear.  The different sounds indicate that the T-Ray is scanning a different material.<P>

"T-rays can give you a fingerprint of the material or a signature of the material.  Because every material, whether they be gases or liquids or solids, actually have different absorption and dispersion characteristics.  What that means is that tererahertz waves go through the material they get distorted in a very very characteristic way."<P>

"The characteristics of T-Rays in general is that they easily go through most dry non metallic objects, like cardboard, wood, cloth, glass, plastics.  So all of these materials that are used in packaging for instance are almost entirely transparent."<P>

One of the most promising applications of T-Ray technology is package inspection.<P>

"X-rays can also do that but it turns out that X-rays are such high energy, are sometimes a safety hazard.  Terrahertz radiation because it's such a low energy it really is, in the thermal range of the electromagnetic spectrum, it is completely benign as far as we know."<P>

<CENTER>T-RAYS--A New Look Inside</CENTER>

X-Rays aren't the only form of radiation that enable us to look inside of things.  Terahertz, or T-Rays, have a frequency range between microwaves and infrared radiation, and they offer scientists a new way to inspect, measure and analyze.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Every kind of material absorbs or disperses T-Rays slightly differently, enabling scientists to use this benign form of radiation in a number of different applications.  Martin Nuss is with Bell Laboratories' Lucent Technologies.<P>  

<B>ambience</B> T-Rays

He and his colleagues have designed a scanner which emits a focused beam of T-Rays in rapid pulses.<P>  

"There's a whole class of applications that you can envision for T-ray imaging.  And you can classify in three categories.  One is general quality control.  Density, looking for cracks in packaging, looking for voids in certain materials.  The second class is moisture measurement and water content.  That is very important to a number of industries.  First it's important to the food industry.  Moisture in baked products like cereal an bread and cookies has to be controlled very tightly.  The last application that we envision to be very promising is in gas detection and gas monitoring.  Because when T-rays pass through gases their waveforms get changed in such a characteristic way that we can immediately identify which gas the T-rays passed through and what concentration of gas was present at that time.  So we envision that we can use T-rays for toxic gas monitoring and general environmental sensing."<P>

<CENTER>EARTHQUAKES -- Bio-Mechanics to the Rescue</CENTER>

In recent years, earthquakes have been responsible for the deaths of thousands of people and have caused billions of dollars worth of damage.  In an effort to design safer, earthquake-proof structures, scientists are looking to biological models.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. George Lee is the director of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering and research, to design to a building that can withstand an earthquake, he's turned to the study of bio-mechanics, which solves engineering problems by studying the models of living systems.<P>

"So we learn form physiology, from the mechanical behavior of a living system.  We actually learn from that and bring that principle into engineering practice, how to design a man-made system that can be more intelligent."<P>

Dr. Lee and his colleagues have designed a device that can be retrofitted into existing structures or installed in new buildings.  It detects the relative motion and power of an earthquake and responds by causing different parts of the structure or absorb the shock, just as the human body would respond to an external push.  We're listening to the sounds of a prototype of the device in motion.<P>

<B>ambience</B> RSD Device<P>
"This particular variable stiffness device for example in real time we can make it totally rigid to behave like a steel bar.  Milliseconds later we can completely relax it.  Now think about yourself.  When you're walking on the deck of a boat and it's shaking, what you do is you just adjust yourself, and one time you might stiffen the muscle in your right leg and relax on the left.  When it goes the other way, you will suddenly stiffen the muscle on your left and relax your right.  So that sudden stiffening and relaxing of the muscle is what this functional switch is doing."<P>

<CENTER>EARTHQUAKES--Preventing Damage</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> RSM Device<P>

Were listening to the sounds of a prototype device designed to help buildings withstand the force of an earthquake.  Im Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"The system that we have may be described in three components.  The first one is called the sensors, or information gathering devices."<P>

Dr. George Lee is the Director of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research.<P>

"The second component of the system is a decision-making unit, which is basically just a computer that takes all the information, analyzes the information, and makes a decision what to do.  If it should decide that the vibrations are too severe, than the decision making device will give orders to these devices that we call them functional switches.  These functional switches will open or adjust this valve, now you hear the clicking sound of the adjustment of the valve, so they can stiffen or dampen the vibrations of the structure."<P>

The ability to stiffen, or cushion, structural supports, together with the sensors or computers, enable this system to respond instantly to the particular motion of an earthquake.<P>

"Earthquake ground motion is really random in nature.  It happens all the time different, but really in general they're very similar.  But the minor details in the motion makes a big difference in terms of how it affects the structural response.  There's always a challenge to better design the structures."<P>

Dr. Lee envisions other applications for this device as well.<P>

"This technology can protect structures from other natural hazards as well, like windstorms or tornadoes.  In addition, it can improve performance on mechanical systems, in automobiles, boats, ships, and so on and so forth."<P>

<CENTER>FLOATING AIRPORTS</CENTER>
 
For coastal cities, available real estate is often at a premium, particularly for something as large as an airport.  But what if you built an entire airport off shore on a floating platform?  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> ocean waves<P>

Don Innes is chairman of the board of Float, Inc.<P>

"If you as a child have probably taken a glass and turned it upside down in the water.  You pushed the open face down in the water and you've seen that the glass doesn't sink.  Well what is happening in that situation is that you've trapped a bubble of air in the glass, and the glass is pressing back against your hand do to the compression of the air in that bubble.  No matter what you do you will not be able to push it straight down and sink the glass.  Th same principle we use for our platform except we take a lot of these glasses and instead of calling them glasses we call them cylinders and they're cylinders that are twenty feet in diameter, forty feet high, and we complicate the glass analogy by drilling a small hole in the side that lets an air bubble escape from a high pressure cylinder into a lower pressure cylinder.  Therefore evening or averaging out the pressure that is placed on the platform itself.  This has two effects.  It one tends to put less force on the platform, it tends to lift the platform less.  It also seems to have an opposite and equal reaction to the wave itself.  It tends to dampen the wave thatt is trying to lift the platform."<P>

And what would it feel like to be on a floating airport?<P>

<CENTER>FLOATING AIRPORTS--Wave of the Future</CENTER>

The airport of the future might be located on a floating platform. Engineers are studying the possibility of building a floating airport about three miles off the coast of San Diego.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> ocean waves<P>

Don Innes is chairman of the board of Float, Inc.<P>

"Well the idea came from a suggestion made some thirty years ago by the mayor of the city of San Diego to build an extension to naval air stations runways out into the ocean.  This was unacceptable because it would affect the currents and the quality of water off our shore.  Then I thought maybe we should move our whole airport off-shore.  Then instead of connecting it to the land we would float it on the top of the surface so we would not affect the ocean or the sea life that exists out on the platform itself."<P>

"Airports are probably the worst pollution devices that we can create on shore.  They attract a lot of automobiles, they attract a lot of trucks, industry.  They tend to pollute very large regions with noxious fumes from hydrocarbons from these aircraft as well as the automobiles.  By placing one out to sea we get away from the noise pollution because we have no population out there to be affected by the noise.  We are able to distribute the solid pollutants in the air over a natural area that is unoccupied and we have the advantage of having no obstacles in either our take-off or our landing corridor which makes it much safer."<P>

<CENTER>FLOATING AIRPORTS--A Haven at Sea</CENTER>

A newly designed floating platform may one day make it possible to build airports, oil refineries and stable harbors - in the middle of the ocean.   I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Wave Tank<P>

We're listening to the sounds of a wave tank used to test the platform prototype.  Don Innes is chairman of the board of Float, Inc.<P>

"What you see here is a 1/24 scale replica of the system that we are using for such things as floating airports."<P>

The floating airport will rest on a platform of up to 30.000 cylinders.  The cylinders are all linked together, enabling an air pocket trapped underneath them to collectively dampen the effects of ocean waves - keeping the platform stable.<P>

"The breakthrough is that heretofore all stabilized platforms in the ocean have worked on the principle of avoiding the waves instead of confronting the waves. That's fine and dandy except the only way to access the platform is by helicopter because you can't bring a ship along side because the ship will pound the platform apart or pound the ship apart, one of the two.  And so the access to a platform is a very critical issue, particularly if you are thinking in terms, as we are, of building harbors anywhere in the world that they cannot currently be built, so that we can bring and load ships and cruise ships and water taxis to the area without endangerment to either the cargo or the passengers.  We create with this platform a calm water on the down wave side, so in essence every time we bring a platform in we have created a harbor, a calm harbor."<P>

<CENTER>CARBON MONOXIDE CATALYST</CENTER>

Hundreds of people die each year from Carbon Monoxide poisoning.  Now a new chemical catalyst has been developed that converts Carbon Monoxide at room temperature into a harmless gas. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"Carbon Monoxide poisoning is really quite common in homes, and what causes it, of course, is some sort of leak that would be a source of carbon monoxide.  A faulty furnace, a faulty fireplace, anyone of a number of things in which you could have incomplete combustion could furnish carbon monoxide."<P>

David Schreyer is a research chemist at NASA's Langley Research Center.<P>

"The reason carbon monoxide kills people is that carbon monoxide has a much stronger affinity for our blood than oxygen does so carbon monoxide tends to tie up the hemoglobin in our blood and we can't get any  oxygen to stick to the blood, so we simply die of a lack of oxygen."<P>

"Right now the typical way that you would try to remove carbon monoxide from the air would be by filtration.  Active carbon and a few other substances will filter carbon monoxide out.  The problem with that is that filters tend to plug up and you don't always know when they plug up and when a filter does plug up it just lets whatever it was filtering come through in great volumes.  So filters fail catastrophically.  The catalyst that NASA has developed doesn't filter carbon monoxide out.  It converts carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide.  Carbon monoxide is toxic, carbon dioxide is not toxic. And since the catalyst is not absorbing the carbon monoxide, it continues to process long after the filter would have been plugged up.<P>

More on the Carbon Monoxide Catalyst in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>CARBON MONOXIDE CATALYST -- Applications</CENTER>

NASA has come with a substance that converts deadly carbon monoxide gas at room temperature into non-toxic carbon dioxide. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction.  Our catalyst speeds up the process of conversion such that it's performed in a fraction of a second."<P>

"The form of our catalyst is a very thin coating on some sort of a support or substrate as we call it.  And that support or substrate can be any one of a number of things.  The great thing about a catalyst is the only thing that matters about it is its surface.  So a catalyst can be incredibly thin and still be very effective."<P>

"One practical application for for the NASA catalyst is simply the removal of carbon monoxide in houses and any occupied buildings to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning.  In a home heating system, you have an air circulation system.  You draw air into the heater, you heat it, then you circulate the air back into the house.  You would insert the catalyst on an appropriate support in the air intake system, and before the air ever got to the heater it would remove any carbon monoxide that was in the air."<P> 

"Another application would be in transportation vehicles like aircraft.  Many times when there is an aircraft fire the people are not killed by the fire, they are killed by carbon monoxide poisoning.  If this fire takes place on the ground and people had face masks containing air catalysts, the people could walk away from the fire and escape the plane and not be burned. This catalyst could also be used by people in a burning hotel to escape, or by firefighters."<P>

<CENTER>KINETIC TENNIS RACKET</CENTER>

A newly designed tennis racket not only helps prevent tennis elbow, it can actually improve your game. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Kevin Gilbert is president of the ProKennex Company.<P>

"This idea came from an aerospace engineer out of Germany, who had a friend who had tennis elbow.  His friend came to him and asked him if scientists had a way to eliminate the shock and vibration that he assumed was creating this tennis elbow.  At the time, Roland Summer had worked on reducing shock and vibration in airplane wings, using a basic technology that incorporated movable mass in the wings.  He applied this technology in a crude way to a tennis racket and, voila, the friend was able to play tennis again without the pain of tennis elbow.  That's really where the idea began."<P>

Prokennex took Summer's prototype and developed it into the Kinetic tennis racket.<P>

"The Kinetic racket from the outside looks like any other technical, high quality racket.  Unlike any other racket, inside the hoop of the frame you've got a hundred chambers or capsules, and inside each capsule you have a precise amount of what we call kinetic mass, which is really small lead microbearings.  These are free moving, so when you begin to swing the racket, these microbearings move to the back of the chamber.  When the racket meets the tennis ball, it releases all one hundred chambers of kinetic mass, so now all of these microbearings are all moving forward.  So not only do you get the momentum of the frame itself, but you get the momentum of these hundred chambers of kinetic mass to add their energy to the ball.  So, in essence, more stability, less shock, and less vibration.  So you're going to hit better shots, more often, with less effort, and no pain."<P>

<CENTER>KINETIC TENNIS RACKET--More Pwer, Less Pain</CENTER>

High technology is now routinely used to enhance sports equipment and tennis rackets are no exception. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"For the most part I think tennis technology has evolved from wood products to increasing head sizes as a result of lighter weights, really culminating most recently in graphite rackets with wider cross-sections that have become known as wide-bodies which allow rackets to be stiffer and lighter, which translates into more power."<P>

Kevin Gilbert is president of the ProKennex Company, developers of the Kinetic tennis racket.  The frame of the racket contains chambers partly filled with tiny metal bearings.  The bearings add force to the racket's swing and help dampen vibrations from the impact of the ball.<P>

"We've developed this frame and found out that along with the benefits associated with reducing shock and vibration, that it actually enhances the stability of the frame on off-center shots so that you hit the ball straighter more often.  We've also found out that it actually improves or expands the area of the so-called sweet spot or that area that gives you the best results on the face of the frame."<P>

<B>ambience</B> kinetic matter<P>

"This is actually the lead bearings inside these chambers moving.  Right now, you can hear it.  It's imperceptible during play, but what is making this sound is what allows us to increase the sweet spot, reduce the shock, reduce the vibration and all together enhance the performance of the player."<P>

"The kinetic technology could be applied and incorporated into any sports equipment that is impact oriented.  For instance a baseball bat, a hockey stick, a golf club.  Any sports equipment like that we can appreciably enhance the performance of the equipment and the end user."</P>

<CENTER>SUPERSONIC WING</CENTER>

Imagine flying on a supersonic jet from Los Angeles to Tokyo in under four hours.  Well, NASA is developing a technology that will get you there as fast as the Concorde, for the price of a charter flight.  Im Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

When air is turbulent over the wing of an airplane, the turbulence causes a drag on the wing, which causes the airplane to slow down.  Jeffrey Lavell, a scientist at the High Speed Research Program at NASA, explains how turbulence works.<P>

"Turbulence is when the airflow over a wing separates from the wing at some point along the surface and becomes sort of mixed up with the rest of the air surrounding the wing."<P>

Here's the sound of turbulence.<P>

<B>ambience</B> turbulent air flow<P>

Turbulence also causes the airplane to work harder, and thus burn more fuel.  Mr. Lavell, the manager for the Supersonic Laminar Flow Control Project, is developing a new type of aircraft panel which eliminates turbulence.  The panel, called a glove, is made of titanium and fits over the left wing of an F-16 airplane.<P>

"The panel on the F-16 works by providing some suction from underneath the panel through about twelve million holes.  And the reason we do that is so that we can stabilize the layer of air that's flying over the wing by drawing off just a small portion of the airflow through these very tine holes.  We actually tend to keep the the layer of air stable and keep it from becoming turbulent."<P>

The stable current of air is called laminar airflow, which slides off the wing of the plane rather than causing drag.  Here's the smoother sound of laminar airflow:<P>

<B>ambience</B> laminar airflow<P>

"And if we can make airflow across the wing completely laminar, then what we can do is cut down on the drag and we can save a lot of weight on the airplane and we can save fuel.  And in the end result, we can make tickets a lot cheaper for passengers."<P>

<CENTER>SUPERSONIC WING--High Speed Civil Transport</CENTER>

Mention NASA and most people think of expensive research projects with little or no benefits for the average citizen.  But, with their latest attempt to develop affordable supersonic transportation, NASA is proving that not only can they help everyday people, but also that they can also be thrifty.  Im Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

At the Langley research Center, NASA scientists are working in conjunction with leading airplane manufacturers to create a technology for a new type of inexpensive supersonic jet.  The researchers are designing a new type of aircraft wing which will make supersonic travel more efficient.  The wing reduces turbulent air flow, eliminating drag on the plane, and saving fuel.  NASA is testing their technology using computers and a prototype of the wing attached to an F-16 XL fighter jet.  As project manager Jeffrey Lavell explains, this is an extremely cost-effective way of perfecting the technology.<P>

"The main reason were doing the F-16 XL experiment is to validate some computer codes that weve been using for quite some time.  By gathering flight data, we can compare that to what weve predicted with our computer codes and we can adjust our codes.  Its much easier, as you can imagine, to design things with a computer than to build a whole airplane and go flight test it, and then have to come back and make changes."<P>

The end result of this research will be the new supersonic High Speed Civil Transport.<P>

"The High Speed Civil Transport is currently planned for introduction in about the year 2015.  It's an airplane that will fly at about 2.4 times the speed of sound or MACH 2.4.  The High Speed Civil Transport will be larger than the Concorde.  It will carry about three times the amount of passengers, but probably the biggest difference is it will be affordable."<P>

That means NASA's thriftiness will pay off in dollars, and hours.<P>

<B>ambience</B> tissue mixing machine<P>

Dr. Peter Olsen is a senior scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and he builds body parts called phantoms. We're listening to a machine mixing up the plastics used to make simulated human flesh - what Dr. Olsen calls "tissue equivalent."<P>

"The idea is to simulate the characteristics of human tissues in enough detail and accuracy that we are in effect mimicking the various body tissues of humans."<P>  

Not to worry. Dr. Olsen isn't building creatures - he's helping people who may have been exposed to radiation.  A tiny amount of radioactive material is placed in the synthesized body parts, and then they're used to ensure that the instruments which measure radiation in people are accurate. Dr. Olsen makes everything from phantom limbs to phantom organs, such as lungs.<P> 

"This lung part will eventually contain a uniform or a non-uniform distribution of a very small tiny amount of radiactive material. And then it will go inside an actual body phantom with tissue equivalent overlays, plastics that will mimic adipose fat, etc. And then this whole device, when it's packaged together, will be brought to a whole body counting facility, and it will be used to complete the calibrations. The system is then used for radiological protection for people."<P> 

The people being measured with these instruments would initially include workers in the nuclear industry, or medical technicians who deal with radiation devices.<P>

"We're always on the lookout for more compatible materials inside the body. For example,  you can invent ceramics that are much more biocompatible than surgical steel for pins and plates and so forth."<P>

<CENTER>BIOCERAMICS - Destroying Disease with Heat</CENTER>


High temperature is one way to destroy cancerous tissue. The problem is how to apply heat to a tumor without damaging the healthy tissue around it.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Alix Clare is an associate professor of glass science at Alfred University in New York. She's developing a method to deliver heat to a tumor using tiny particles of glass.<P> 

"The materials we make here are called glass ceramics, and that means that they're glasses with little crystals in and those crystals are magnetically susceptible. That means that if I put them in a magnetic field that oscillates backwards and forwards, theyll heat up. (1885) The particular use for these materials is to deliver a local heat source to the body, and the reason that you might want to that is that bad tissue in the body, such as in a cancerous tumor, is destroyed at a lower temperature than healthy tissue is. Therefore, in principal, as long as you can keep the temperture between two windows there, you can actually destroy bad tissue without affecting healthy tissue."<P>  

<B>ambience</B> rollers<P>

To make the glass, Dr. Clare melts down the component materials and pours the liquid over spinning rollers. The cooled pieces of glass would then be ground up into particles about the size of a blood cell, and injected into a tumor.<P>

(1933)  "Then the persons whole body would be put in an oscillating magnetic field, and only the part that contained the glass ceramic would actually heat up, thus destroying the bad part, and not affecting the good part. After the glass has done the work and caused the tumor to decrease, and even go away, then the glass is bioresolvable. And what we mean by that is,  it dissolves harmlessly away in the body, introducing into the body only elements that are there in the first place."<P>

<CENTER>ROBOT THERAPY</CENTER>


In the future, if you get treated by a physical therapist, you might find yourself shaking hands with a robot. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Neville Hogan is a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. He and his colleagues are testing a prototype robot designed to exercise the arms of a patient disabled by a stroke. First, the patient sits at a table and grasps a handle on the robot's arm.<P>

"It's very much like asking the patient to shake hands with the robot. There's then a visual display provided, and the patient is initially asked to move a cursor on a screen, very much the way that you'd move a mouse in operating a computer program."<P>  

<B>ambience</B> sliding<P>

As the patient slides the robotic arm across the tabletop, the device measures how much force the person is exerting, and it assists the movement when necessary.<P>

"Early in the therapy, the patient is unable to move and so the robot's responsible for the movement. As the patient begins to recover, the responsibility for the movement is actaully shared between the patient and the robot. And then later in the therapy, as the patient begins to recover more fully, the robot does less and less and winds up essentially going along for the ride, simply recording the movement that the patient makes."<P> 

A machine can easily perform this same exercise with the patient many times, and keep precise records of each movement. But researchers are still trying to determine whether the robot-aided therapy really helps the patient.<P>

"If we can prove that it is useful for even a simple movement, then we've got our foot in the door. And if the only weakness was that, well, we can rehabilitate the hand but what about the leg, well, we can go back and make a machine for the leg.  At this stage we're trying to see, does this kind of approach make sense at all."<P>

<CENTER>ROBOTIC THERAPY - Not a Replacement</CENTER>


Recovering from a stroke can require months of physical therapy. Now, researchers are testing a robot that might be able to provide some of that rehabiliation. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Neville Hogan is a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.<P> 

"Our goal is not to replace human therapists. What we're after instead is to provide tools to assist the clinician, to let the clinician get better use of their time."<P>  

The prototype robot is designed to exercise the arm. The patient sits at a table, grips a handle on the robotic arm, and slides it along a tabletop, following the progress on a computer screen. It looks and sounds a little like a video game.<P> 

<B>ambience</B> music<P>

If the robotic therapy proves useful, Dr. Hogan envisions a clinic of the future where a therapist could work with several patients at a time.<P>

"Each of the patients in the clinic is working individually with a robot, but the clinician is acting more as a supervisor, determining what should be done by the robot with a particular patient. But the therapist doesn't have to do the immediate manual work of actually moving the limbs, and doesn't have to do the work of keeping track of what's going on. The robot by definition has computer attached to it, that's how we get control, and so the robot at minimum provides a very efficient way of recording data and collating it and analyzing the progress of the patient as they recover from a stroke."<P>

<CENTER>WRIST PHONE</CENTER>


Portable phones have transformed the way that we communicate with each other.  You can routinely phone home from cars, trains,  or just walking in the street. Coming up - the next incarnation of the telephone. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> wrist phone call<P>

It might sound like an ordinary phone, but it looks like a bulky wristwatch. Greg Blonder, a researcher at AT&T Laboratories helped develop this prototype.<P> 

"There are two reasons we were sure everyone would end up carrying a telephone with them at all times someday. The first reason is, the cost and the size of electronics is getting smaller every year, as everybody knows, both the electronics that's inside your personal computer, as well as the electronics that's inside your car are small and affordable. But the second reason is, people really like to own their own their own things."<P>
 
<B>ambience<B> ringing<P>

"We looked at a lot of places to put a phone. We looked on the wrist, in your belt, around your neck, on your lapel, even in your shoe like Maxwell Smart. We just couldn't imagine someone outside on a cold day with their pocket ringing, trying to rip off their coat to take a call. The wrist turned out to be the best location."<P>   

The wrist communicator has two overlapping bands. So when the phone rings...<P>
<B>ambience</B> ringing<P>
...the outer wristband can be unfurled so that the speaker at the end fits into the palm of your hand. You place your hand against your ear, and speak into the microphone still attached to your wrist. The prototype works like a standard cordless phone, so it can't stray too far from its base.<P>

"If it were a cellular phone, the small battery that you can fit in a watch doesn't have the power to compete against car phones. And so to make a really high quality cellular phone work, we're going to have to wait for either more efficient cellular standards, which are already on the way, or until they build the cell sites closer and closer together."<P>

<CENTER>WRIST PHONE - Better Than Dick Tracy's</CENTER>


What does Dick Tracy do when he needs a little back-up? He calls on the old wrist radio, of course. And soon, you might be talking into your wrist as well. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"People have always, at least since Dick Tracy, envisioned some kind of wrist communicator. But there's a long distance between comic strips and real technology."<P> 

Greg Blonder is a researcher at AT&T Laboratories in New Jersey.  He and his colleagues have built a prototype wrist communicator that uses ordinary cordless phone technology.<P>

<B>ambience</B> wrist communicator call<P>

"The wrist communicator straps to your wrist like any other watch, but unlike most watches it had two wristbands. There's an inner band to hold it onto your wrist at all times, there's an outer band which is actually the handset that unfurls when the phone rings so that you can rotate it and place the speaker, which is at one end of the outer band, in the palm of your hand, and the microphone, which is attached to the joint of the outer and inner band."<P> 

So you bring the palm of your hand up to your ear, and you talk into the microphone on the wristband.  Now, while developing this prototype, the researchers found a few ways to improve on Dick Tracy's design.<P>

"One problem with the Dick Tracy watch is that it's not private. Everyone can hear the conversation, it's a speakerphone on your wrist. So we had to find a way to fold a handset to fit a wristwatch shape. Second of all, it's relatively inconvenient to hold your arm out in front of your body for a half-hour discussion. So we had to find a way so that you could actually rest your arm against your head when you speak. And lastly, it takes a lot of electrical power to make a speakerphone work in a noisy environment. And we wanted to have a wrist communicator that sounded every bit as good as your phone at home."<P> 

The product is still in development, and a cellular version may be available within five years.<P>

<CENTER>NANOELECTRONICS</CENTER>


The electronics in your VCR or home computer contain tiny components, many times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. But the electronics of the future will be even smaller. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> cryopump<P>

We're in the laboratory of Dr. Udi Meirav at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel, where researchers are building some of the world's tiniest microcircuitry. It's a new field called nanoelectronics. Dr. Meirav cites two reasons for making electronics smaller and smaller.<P>

"It's only by making things sufficiently small that you can actually generate a very complex circuit with a lot of information in it.  But perhaps the more dominant motivation at present is speed. The smaller you make the components, in principle, the faster they can operate. And the reason for that is really quite simple, it's a question of how long, how much time it takes for electrical signals to propogate from one part of the circuit to the other.  And the smaller everything is, the less time it takes for these signals to propogate, and the entire calculation process becomes shorter."<P> 

But when you reach this scale of smallness, it isn't just the speed that changes.<P> 
 
"Beyond a certain level of miniaturization, it turns out that the fundamental laws of physics, of electricity, are going to look substantially different than as we have known them.  And that  means that if we continue to miniaturize circuits the way we have done until now, not only will they operate perhaps faster or in a more efficient way, but they will actually operate under completely different principles. And these principles have to be understood and studied thoroughly before we can actually make use of them and continue the process of miniaturization. So the study of physics of extrememly small electronic devices is really laying the foundation for the future of electronics."<P>

<CENTER>NANOELECTRONICS - Ballistc Motion</CENTER>


The search for ever-faster electronic devices is taking microcircuitry to a new level of miniaturization - where electrons go ballistic. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> cryopump<P>

We're in a laboratory at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel, where tiny nanoelectric components are manufactured. These semiconductor materials are even smaller than today's microcircuitry, but this degree of miniaturization can change the way electronics work. One fundamental difference has to do with the way that electrons travel through matter.  Senior scientist Dr. Udi Meirav.<P>

"Electrons move through solids in a sort of zig zag pattern.  They dont move in straight lines, they sort of bump into atoms and then keep on going and then bump into another atom. So they form this sort of funny jagged path. It turns out that if you make a device very small, smaller than the typical size of each one of these zig zags, then the entire principle of motion of electrons has a very different nature. Things like the relation between current and voltage, those things cease to work."<P>  

Now that could be good news or bad news for an electrical engineer.<P>

"Its bad news because you really have to rethink the relations between the various currents and voltages in your circuit.  But it could imply very very fast operation of circuits, because as soon as the components become smaller than the typical zig zag path, then electrons are actually moving in a straight line from one end to the other of your device.  This kind of motion is called ballistic motion, and it's a very efficient way of getting across a device. What ballistic motion of electrons gives is an enormous gain in speed of the device. More than you've bargained for in the first place by just making things smaller."<P>  

Understanding the way that ballistic motion works will be essential to reducing the  size of electronic devices in the future.<P>

<CENTER>NANOELECTRONICS - How Small?</CENTER>


The first computers filled entire rooms. Today, an ordinary laptop is the size of a notebook. Well, how much smaller can electronics get? I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"Already today if you look into a desktop PC, and you open its box, youll find that its essentially empty. There's a tiny chip there, which is about the size of a coin, and that is everything, all the action takes place there.  The rest is just some peripherals which really do some very primitive power handling functions."<P>  

Dr. Udi Meirav is a senior scientist at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel. He studies nanoelectronics - structures even smaller than the microelectronics in today's PCs or cell phones. The nanoelectronic components are so tiny they have to be built in a vacuum to make sure they're virtually free of contaminants. The pumps we're listening to are used to maintain the vacuum in the chambers where the devices are put together.<P>

<B>ambience</B> cryopump<P>

Now the smaller the electronic components are, the faster they can operate, at least in theory.  How tiny can you get? Well, Dr. Meirav says the possibilities could be unlimited.<P>

"There have been many predictions in the past as to how small things could be made. And time and again, these predictions have turned out to be wrong. Engineers have found ingenious ways how to continue the process of miniaturization beyond some I would say naive predictions, which said well, you couldn't go beyond this scale because of this or because of that. Clearly, you couldnt make things smaller than a single atom. But anything larger than a single atom, I think would be speculative to say its impossible to reduce anything below that scale."<P>

<CENTER>REMOTE SURGERY</CENTER>


Before too long,  surgeons may be able to perform operations on patients located in another hospital - even in another city.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

It's called telesurgery - operations performed via long-distance.  A company in Menlo Park, California has developed a prototype named the Telepresence Surgery System.<P>

<B>ambience</B> control input<P>

The surgeon sits at a workstation that has mechanical arms with the handle ends of surgical instruments attached. There's also a three-dimensional video view of the surgical site. Dr. Ajit Shah, the director of SRI International's Medical Technology Laboratory, explains.<P>

"What I simply do is I sit down at the surgical workstation, and I grasp in my right hand a set of instrument handles that is standard on any set of surgical instruments, and I grab in my left hand a very similar set of instrument handles."<P>  

Positioned over the patient is another set of mechanical arms, and grasped in their hands are the business ends of the instruments - the blades, clamps or whatever. That side of the device is called the slave.<P>

"And now as I start to move my right hand and you look over at the slave side which is in fact positioned over the patient, my right hand makes motions that are in fact exactly recreated by the slave. As I pick up tissue with my right hand at the workstation, the slave picks up tissue in its right hand over the patient. And so when I look in my surgical field, that instrument at the slave side is a simple extension of what I'm holding or perceive to be holding in my right hand. And so as I carry out a range of surgical moves, it's a very natural process. It's intuitive and it literally feels as if I'm holding the instruments in my hand."<P>

<CENTER>REMOTE SURGERY - Battlefield</CENTER>


Computer technology may one make it possible for doctors to perform operations on soldiers injured in battle, without having to evacuate the soldier to a hospital. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"Soldier goes out. Soldier gets wounded. Medic goes out in the battlefield, and has to try and find that soldier. Once he's found, he's got to try and triage this soldier along with all the other casualties that he has."<P> 

Dr. Ajit Shah is the director of the Medical Technology Laboratory at SRI International in Menlo Park, California.  Usually, he says, a wounded soldier has to wait until he can be transported to a hospital.<P>

"And  that period of time is a very critical period of time for the soldier. He typically can bleed to death or die from the injuries that he's sustained. And what this technology does is, it really changes that. The new scenario is: Soldier goes out in the battlefield. Gets wounded. The medic locates him. And immediately evacuates the crtically wounded soldier 100 yards or a couple of hundred meters to an armored vehicle which contains the Telepresence Surgery System in it."<P> 

Inside the armored vehicle would be an operating table with mechanical arms above it. These arms hold surgical instruments - such as a scalpel.  A safe distance away from the battlefield, a surgeon sits at a computer workstation monitoring the patient on his screen and manipulating the handles of the surgical instruments, which are attached to another set of mechanical arms. He performs the operation via remote control.<P>

"This soldier now can receive definitive medical care because back at a MASH unit, safe behind the battle lines, is a surgeon who's waiting, who's able to transfer his knowledge and his skills through the medic and through the system  to provide care to the wounded soldier."<P> 

Human tests of the Telepresence Surgery System are expected to take place over the next few years.<P>

<CENTER>DIAGNOSING BONE DISEASE WITH SOUND</CENTER>


A new technology is using sound to diagnose the bone disease osteoporosis. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Andrew Dimaroganas, a professor of mechanical design at Washington University in St. Louis, has developed a device that could offer a better way to test for osteoporosis. He taps on two ordinary china cups to demonstrate how his system works.<P>

"I have two china cups. One has a tiny crack, hairlike crack, barely visible. And then if you hit them, the one that does not have the crack produces a high-pitched sound with a long duration."<P>
 
<B>ambience</B> china cup: high-pitched sound<P>

"And then when we hit the other one that has the hairlike crack, it produces a low-pitched and short duration of sound like..."<P> 

<B>ambience</B> china cup:  dull sound<P>

The bones of a person who has the disease are porous - they have small holes in them. And just as the crack in the china cup dulls its sound, the cavities in the patient's bone dampen a sound that is sent through it.<P>

<B>ambience</B> sweep<P>

A pencil-sized metal stem is placed gently on the patient's skin above the bone to be tested, and this sweep of sound that we're listening to is produced by a computer. Another device, similar to a microphone, measures the sound that's been passed through the bone.<P>

"Now the bone has small cavities because of osteoporosis, and the more cavities we have the more energy they destroy as the sound goes through the bone. Therefore at the point of measurement, the sound that we get has less intensity. And the more cavities we have in the bone, the less intensity remains after passing through the bone."<P>

<CENTER>INJECTABLE HAIR</CENTER>


A new process uses a person's own hair to create an injectable filler that can be used for cosmetic or medical procedures.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

These days, if you want to fill in wrinkles or undergo other cosmetic surgery, the material of choice is collagen - made from cow skin.  A new alternative material is being developed by Cheryl Blanchard, a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.<P>

"Essentially we start out with a sample of human hair, and that is bleached and cleaned and cut up manually so that it's sort of a free-flowing powder. That material then gets put into a beaker with some type of organic solvent such as acetone, and it gets run through the homogenizer unit for a fairly long period of time until it's ground up into very very small particles."<P>  

<B>ambience</B> homogenizer<P>

"Hair is not an easy material to break down. It has a very high strength, a very high tensile strength. And so it takes quite a bit to break it down into smaller particles, and that turned out to be one of the hardest things for us to figure out how to do. Once the hair is broken down after a significantly long period of time in the homogenizer unit, we take the solution and centrifuge it, and then use the centrifuge to wash and clean the hair, so we'll centrifuge it and then fill the centrifuge tube back up, wash it out and then re-centrifuge it a number of times.  We then take it and dry it out, and then we're ready to re-suspend it in the injectable material, which would probably be a sterile saline, and it's ready for injection."<P>  

According to Dr. Blanchard, the hair-based material has an advantage over collagen -- it appears less likely to be rejected since it comes from a person's own body.  The filler has been tried on people on a limited basis with encouraging results.<P>

<CENTER>INJECTABLE HAIR - Applications</CENTER>


We typically think of our hair as either decorative or annoying, depending upon where it's growing and how it's behaving. Well now, thanks to a new process, our hair could be turned into something medically useful. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Cheryl Blanchard is a scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. She uses a person's own hair - which is made of the protein keratin - to create an injectable filler material for cosmetic and medical purposes.<P>

<B>ambience</B> homogenizer<P>
 
"Basically we take the hair, break it down, process it in a piece of equipment called a homogenizer so that it breaks it down into submicrometer-sized particles, or very very small particles. These particles are then sterilized and put back into an injectable carrier material such as sterile saline, and then that mixture is put into a syringe and used to inject for soft tissue augmentation purposes."<P>  

"The practical uses of this injectable material would be to fill in cosmetic defects in someone's face, such as to fill in a wrinkle, to fill in a scar, or to fill in a deficiency where someone wanted mass to be under their skin. There are also some medical applications, such as treating vocal cords that have lost their elasticity, or for treating female urinary incontinence.  There are some other uses for this material that we're beginning to find that are related to wound healing. Since the top layer of our skin is made up primarily of keratin, we've discovered that by taking this keratin-based paste it is very useful in wound healing applications."<P> 

There are other materials in use today for soft tissue augmentation, but the hair -based filler appears to be less likely to dissolve or cause an adverse immune reaction.<P>

<CENTER>JOINT REPAIR</CENTER>


When a joint is injured, it's often the cartilage that's least likely to
heal properly.  A new technique is being tried on racehorses that uses cell
transplants to better mend the damage. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the
Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Horse on Treadmill<P>

That's the sound of a  horse being tested on a treadmill to see how well
it's responding to a technique being developed by Dr. Alan Nixon, at
Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine. The technique involves
transplanting cartilage cells that will then grow and multiply.<P>

"Cartilage is a peculiar tissue in that once it's damaged, particularly in
an adult, there's a very poor response. As a result of that, we've been
seeking new methods to improve that type of cartilage surface for many
years. And this is by far the best of the techniques that we've evaluated.
We want cells that will produce new cartilage. And if you can improve the
quality of the activity of the cells that you transplant, you'll get a
better quality of cartilage."<P>

To improve the quality of cartilage cells, you grow them in the lab before
the transplant.<P>

"This is a cell-culture procedure where we either take calls from the same
animal or we take cells from another animal that has been destroyed for
other reasons. They provide some donor tissues where we harvest the cells
from the cartilage surfaces. We treat them in the laboratory to get the
numbers increased. And when their numbers are up, then we'll transplant
them. And that pool of new cells essentially helps to provide a much
improved cartilage healing response."<P>

The method seems to be working well with Dr. Nixon's horse patients. And a
similar technique is being tried on people with encouraging results.<P>

<CENTER>JOINT REPAIR - Arthritis Prevention</CENTER>


A new technique for repairing cartilage in horses may one day help prevent
some forms of arthritis in humans. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse
of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Alan Nixon is an orthopedic surgeon at the College of Veterinary
Medicine at Cornell University. He's working with a new form of treatment
on injured horses in an effort to help their cartilage heal better.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Horse on Treadmill<P>

That's the sound of a horse being tested on a treadmill,  to help measure
how effective the treatment is.<P>

"New methods of treating knee injuries are important because cartilage
inherently has very poor healing capacity. The nature of the healing
response is usually so bad that many of them develop arthritis. And with
the development of arthritis they become quite lame and there is very
little treatment-wise that can be done to alleviate the lameness."<P>

Dr. Nixon's technique involves taking cartilage cells from a donor animal,
treating them with growth agents to make them more active, and then
transplanting the cells into the injured cartilage.<P>

"Our primary aim in any of these transplantation techniques is to prevent
the development of arthritis. Once the arthritis is set up, there's really
no turning back. It's a one-way street."<P>

There's hope that this technique may eventually be used to prevent some
forms of arthritis in people.<P>

"Whenever you can heal a cartilage defect when it's fresh, before it
becomes arthritis, then you avert the development of arthritis. The
technology   were working on is designed primarily to prevent that
arthritis from developing. By doing that, whether it's for animals or
whether it's for people, we're really improving the quality of people's
lives, the quality of animals' lives. And I think the technology should
carry us through to the point where we can prevent a substantial amount of
the arthritis that is occurring."<P>

<CENTER>TIME REVERSAL MIRROR</CENTER>


If you hold an open book up to a mirror, the words are seen written
backwards. Now, imagine what would happen if you could do the same thing
with sound. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, ".tenalP eht fo esluP eht si siht dna ,renzteM miJ m'I"<P>

That's what it sounds like if you play a tape backwards in real time. But
some French scientists have developed a device that reverses sound waves
instantaneously. They call it the Acoustic Time Reversal Mirror. Didier
Casserau works in the engineering school at the University of Paris.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, TRM<P>

"In fact the basic principle of the time reversal mirror is very similar as
reversing a tape. But the problem is much more complex because it's not a
physical tape."<P>

First, an ultrasonic wave is directed at the time-reversal mirror. The
device then reverses the acoustic signals, creating a new wave that goes
back to the initial source.  So unlike that tape we just heard where you
had to play back the entire phrase to hear the first words spoken
backwards,  the time-reversal mirror reverses each acoustical signal at the
moment it occurs. The technology could be used to detects flaws in
metal.<P>

"This technology detects the small defects in the metal by first
illuminating the medium with an initial acoustic beam that moves in the
material. Then the defect generates a reflected wave that moves back in the
direction of the time reversal mirror.  And this allows detection of
defects in the metal. There are some other technologies that use sound to
detect defects in metal, but the advantage of the time reversal mirror is
that it allows detection of smaller defects and it is a more precise
method."<P>

<CENTER>TIME REVERSAL MIRROR - Kidney Stones</CENTER>


A new technology  could offer a better way to break up kidney stones. I'm
Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Didier Casserau works in the engineering school at the University of Paris.
He's  developing a device called an Acoustic Time Reserval Mirror. It takes
a sound wave and, just like a mirror does with a visual image, sends back a
signal that reverses the acoustical image of the original source.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, TRM<P>

"The time reversal mirror first observes the sound wave generated by a
source, then it reverses all the electronic signals to generate a new wave
that moves back to what's the initial source location."<P>

One use for the technology could be to detect defects in metal. It may also
be effective as a new treatment for kidney stones.<P>

"The time reversal mirror first illuminates the body,  a wave is created in
the body, and this wave is reflected by the kidney stone. The time reversal
mirror pushes this wave back and concentrates high energy in the
neighborhood of the kidney stone, and this breaks it up."<P>

Ultrasound is already used to break up kidney stones, but the time reversal
mirror technology could have some advantages over current methods.<P>

"At this time the kidney stones can be treated using ultrasound with
devices that generate high energy near the kidney stone, but the problem is
that the patient breathes during operation and thus the kidney stone moves.
The time reversal mirror is better than other technologies,  first because
it is more precise to detect the kidney stone, and second because it can
follow the kidney stone in real time such that all the wave always reaches
the stone."<P>

<CENTER>MICROBIAL MATS</CENTER>


Need any help cleaning up contaminated water? Well, consider employing the
services of some blue-green algae and a few other handy microbes.  I'm Jim
Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Water Dripping<P>

We're listening to water dripping through a microbial mat, a layered colony
of living microbes that consume contaminants. This mat was grown in Dr.
Judith Bender's research lab at Clark Atlanta University, but the idea
comes from nature.<P>

"Natural microbial mats are mixed microbial ecosystems. They're dominated
by blue-green algae, and they have other kinds of bacteria that naturally
associate with it.  They're found in tidal zones, but actually you can find
them in freshwater areas, too. You can find them in parking lots."<P>

Dr. Bender and her colleagues construct microbial mats using fermented
grass clippings dosed with blue-green algae and whatever other
microorganisms are needed for a particular cleanup job.<P>

"We find these microbial mats in nature. We look at what they do best. We
look at what they do naturally, spontaneously. Basically, we try to
encourage that. By just improving the component microbes we can design them
to do specific jobs. For instance, in constructing mats to take heavy
metals, toxic metals, out of water, we work with integrating certain
bacteria that will produce sulfide. Now the sulfide will precipitate
lead."<P>

That means the lead is separated from the water, and concentrated into a
solid form that can then easily be removed.<P>

"So in that way we've made a special mat to do a special job. And we do
this over and over again for all the different kinds of contaminants that
we have a market for."<P>

<CENTER>MICROBIAL MATS - Uses</CENTER>


Microorganisms such as algae and bacteria can be helpful in the effort to
clean up environmental contamination. And they're versatile, too. I'm Jim
Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Judith Bender is a professor at Clark Atlanta University. She and her
colleagues grow microbial mats - colonies of microbes that consume
contaminants found in water.

<B>ambience</B>, Water Dripping<P>

They first run water through mats in the lab to determine what contaminants
can be removed.<P>

"We have looked at a number of very toxic organic materials, and the mats
have handled all of them.  Now, included in this array is TNT, explosives,
the propellents that propel rockets. We have looked at oil."<P>

Mats can be designed to remove inorganic materials, too.<P>

"Heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium, iron, toxic metals such as
radionuclides, uranium. The mats handle them very well."<P>

Using microbes to clean up contamination isn't a new idea.  But the mats
have some advantages over other methods of bioremediation.<P>

"You can put them exactly where you want them and for the most part they
stay there. Another advantage is that since they provide their own
essential nutrients, they don't have to be fed to keep them alive. In terms
of cost, this is a great advantage. Then the third issue is disposal. So
when we look at how mats mineralize organics so that they don't have to be
disposed of, in the case of metals, they concentrate the metals in very
small areas so that minimizes the disposal cost, these are real practical
advantages."<P>

<CENTER>MICROBIAL MATS - More Than Fish Food</CENTER>


Want to whip up a microbial mat?  Just take some fresh grass clippings,
ferment them, then add a pinch of blue-green algae and other microbes.  I'm
Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Microbial mats are colonies of microorganisms such as algae and bacteria.
In the wild, they exist as natural ecosystems. In the laboratory, the
makeup of the mats can be customized to consume hazardous materials found
in water.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Water Bubbling<P>

Dr. Judith Bender concocts microbial mats in her lab at Clark Atlanta
University.<P>

"We give them some simple minerals on which to grow, and the proper light
and let them do the rest. Now mats are both photosynthetic, that is they
make their own carbohydrates, and nitrogen-fixing, which means they can
make their own protein. So they don't need a lot of feed."<P>

Once the mats are placed in a contaminated area, the microbes get to work
consuming the hazardous materials. Like so many recipes, the one for the
mats was discovered by accident.<P>

"We began the whole project of making blue-green algae mats as a fish feed
project. We were working at that time in the Dominican Republic under a
grant from the Agency for International Development. And the objective was
to make a very low-cost, simple fish feed. And that led us to the grass
clippings, it led us to the blue-green algae, which can make all its
nutrients and pack it in and then the fish eat these nutrients. And it all
worked fine and the fish grew very well, and when we returned to the lab we
found, quite by accident, that these same fish feed mats took out heavy
metals. And then several years later, we discovered that they degraded
oil."<P>

<CENTER>SULPHUR LIGHT</CENTER>


A new kind of lamp uses sulphur and microwaves to create an artificial
light that's bright, energy efficient - and looks a lot like sunlight. I'm
Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Light Turning on<P>

That's the sound of a sulphur lamp being turned on.  Michael Ury is the
vice president of research and development at Fusion Lighting in Rockville,
Maryland.<P>

"The lamp looks like a small golf ball. It's about 35 mm in diameter, it's
made from quartz or fused silica, which is a glasslike material. It's
rotating at a fast speed so you don't notice that it's rotating. And it's
being flooded with microwave energy, so the sulphur is heated to a gaseous
state and the microwave energy is converted to light through the medium of
a hot sulphur plasma. Unfortunately the lamp is noisy compared to other
light sources. You're  listening to a cooling fan, which is blowing air
over the source of the microwave energy, and that source is called a
magnetron. It's almost identical to the magnetron that's in your home
microwave oven."<P>

Now, since the light is strong and the microwave source is noisy, the lamps
will probably be used in places where they can be mounted high up.<P>

"It's such a powerful source, you couldn't really use it in an eight-foot
high ceiling. It certainly will not be in your kitchen until we can make a
lower power version. So for the next few years you'll find this being used
in factories,  perhaps sports arenas, aircraft hangers, shopping malls
where the ceilings are high. It also needs applications where people don't
want the heat. Hockey rinks, for example. Plant growth. This one of the few
light sources where you can light plants to solar level, without cooking
the plants."<P>

<CENTER>SULPHUR LIGHT - Color</CENTER>


One of the limitations of artificial light is that colors don't look quite
the same as they do in sunlight. Well, now a new light allows for a truer
perception of color. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the
Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Light Turning on<P>

We're listening to the sound of a microwave source that's part of a sulphur
light. Michael Ury, the vice president of research and development at
Fusion Lighting in Rockville, Maryland, explains how his company's new
lighting technology works.<P>

"The microwave energy creates an electric field, just as it does in your
home microwave oven, and in a home microwave oven the electric field causes
molecules to vibrate and your food is heated. In this case, the electric
field accelerates electrons which strike molecules of sulphur. They cause
the molecules to be excited, and they emit light. I'd say the light is
closest to sunlight, but it's slightly greenish in color. If you are
inside, your eye adjusts in a matter of seconds. The light appears more
pleasing than fluorescent, because it's truly full color. Is the light more
pleasing than an incandescent source? Well, I think that depends on who's
looking at it. It's a far superior light to work under. You see more
clearly under this light."<P>

Mr. Ury acknowledges that the light isn't right for every circumstance. But
there are applications for which it seems to have a clear advantage.<P>

"Put it this way. If you're out in a parking lot looking for your car at
night, you find that your car has disappeared, because the high pressure
sodium lamp is deficient in the blue and the green, it has a fair amount of
red content. This lamp has all the colors. If we were to light up a parking
lot with this light, you'll find your car, you'll recognize the color."<P>

<CENTER>SULPHUR LIGHT - Energy</CENTER>


A new, energy-efficient lamp produces high-powered lighting using sulphur
and microwaves.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

"Twenty-five percent of the energy consumption in this country goes to
power lighting in commercial buildings and residences. An additional five
percent might be used for the air conditioning to cool that lighting. Why
haven't more energy efficient light sources caught on? Well, one of the
reasons is people like the continuous spectrum of an incandescent source.
They sort of like the color."<P>

Michael Ury is the vice president of research and development at Fusion
Lighting in Rockville, Maryland. They've developed a golf-ball size light
bulb, filled with sulphur, that gives off light when it's flooded with
microwaves, the same energy source used in microwave ovens.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Light Turning on<P>

"The sulphur light source today, is as good as the best light source out
there in terms of energy conservation for reasonably good color. It runs at
about 1350 watts consumption, and produces 100 lumens per watt. Compare
that to the 100-watt incadescent bulb, which produces 17 lumens per watt,
and you can see the remarkable advantage in energy efficiency."<P>

In addition to being more powerful than conventional light sources, the
sulphur lamp is expected to last a long time.<P>

"The bulb itself should last at least 60,000 hours. We honestly don't
understand the failure mechanisms. We don't see any failure mechanisms. But
the microwave source, unfortunately, we estimate will last between 15 and
20,000 hours, and it will have to be replaced."<P>

<CENTER>ADVANCED SAFETY VEHICLE</CENTER>


Most cars will tell you if you've left your lights on or run out of oil.
Well, the car of the future might be even smarter and safer. I'm Jim
Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

An experimental car with 17 new safety features is being developed by the
Toyota Motor Corporation. One of the systems monitors the operator's pulse
and steering, and if it thinks the driver is getting drowsy, the car sounds
a warning.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Drowsy Driver Second Warning<P>

...and vibrates the driver's seat.
Another system uses radar to look up ahead for stationary objects like a
tree or a stopped car. Company spokesperson Frances Champion explains.<P>

"If at a certain distance the radar system realizes that that object is not
moving, it will actually give the driver a warning, saying to either slow
down or to try to divert the car away from the object. At a certain point,
the car will sense that a collision is imminent, and will apply the brakes
regardless of what the driver does, and it will stop the car short of the
barrier."<P>

If the car does hit someone or something, it's designed to minimize
injuries and damage.<P>

"If, by chance, a driver hits a pedestrian on the front of the car, there
is actually a sensor in the bumper which upon impact inflates the airbag on
the hood of the car and cushions the pedestrian's fall to keep them from
hitting the hood as well as the windshield."<P>

Now, the car is strictly experimental at this point, but these features may
be standard equipment someday.<P>

"We have developed these types of experimental vehicles in the past, and
some of the ideas that come out of past vehicles are currently on the road.
For example, airbags, or ABS brake systems."<B>

<CENTER>ADVANCED SAFETY VEHICLE - Drowsy Driver</CENTER>

Even the safest vehicle can't protect you if you fall asleep at the wheel -
that is, unless the car itself can wake you up. I'm Jim Metzner, and this
is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

An experimental car is being developed with more than a dozen high-tech
safety features, including one designed to jolt a sleepy driver back to
alertness. Frances Champion is with Toyota Motor Corporation.<P>

"The Drowsy Driver Warning System monitors a car's steering operation as
well as a person's pulse."<P>

The driver wears a wristband with a heartbeat sensor, and another device
monitors the car's steering.<P>

"So for example if a person is driving and their alertness starts to fall,
then the system senses that and alerts the driver with a warning system,
basically telling the driver to pull over, and take a break, get a cup of
coffee."<P>

There's a warning bell<P>
(B>ambience</B>, Bell-1st warning<P>
and a picture of a coffee cup flashes on the dashboard.<P>

"If the driver chooses to ignore that warning system and continues to
drive, the car gives the driver a second warning, and it's an audiovisual
signal<P>
<B>ambience</B>, Beeps - 2nd warning<P>
coupled with a vibrating of the  actual seat.<P>
<B>ambience</B>, Vibration -  2nd warning<P>
So it tries to wake up the driver. If the driver continues on, and decides
to ignore the second warning, the car then comes to a complete stop by
actually applying an electronic braking system."<P>
<B>ambience</B>, Beep, Alarm - Car Stops<P>
When the system applies the brakes, it sounds another alarm, and flashes
the car's hazard lights.<P>

"The premise was that  for a driver to continue driving is actually more
dangerous. For a drowsy driver to keep driving and possibly swerve over to
the other lane, than to have the vehicle completely stop."<P>

The Drowsy Driver Warning System, like other features in the Advanced
Safety Vehicle, is in the prototype stage, with no immediate plans for
commercial use.<P>

<CENTER>ADVANCED SAFETY VEHICLE - Too Much Safety?</CENTER>


A new experimental car is loaded with safety systems that can rouse a
sleepy driver, put out a fire or stop the vehicle before it hits a tree.
But is it possible to make a car too self-sufficient? I'm Jim Metzner, and
this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Car Sounds<P>

The Advanced Safety Vehicle, or ASV, is a concept car being developed by
Toyota Motor Corporation. Spokesperson Frances Champion explains where the
idea came from.<P>

"It was originally prompted by the Japanese Ministry of Transport to
enhance the intelligence and the safety of automobiles by fully exploiting
electronic technologies. We developed the ASV based first of all on the
philosophy that safety is the responsibility of the individual, but
realizing that humans do have flaws and that we do make mistakes, Toyota
decided to develop the ASV to try to compensate for those driver
errors."<P>

But if cars get too smart, there's a danger that drivers may become too
complacent.<P>

"There's always a possibility of implementing too many safety features into
a vehicle. Psychologically, if a driver gets into a car and knows that the
car is going to back him or her up 100 percent, there is a possibilty that
they may not be as careful or as cautious when they step into a car. So we
of course want to develop safety features inasmuch as we can, and as
technology allows. However there is also that feature of human psychology
that we have to take into consideration. When is it too many systems in
place, and when is it just the right amount."<P>

The ASV is still experimental, and its safety systems aren't expected to be
in place anytime soon.<P>

<CENTER>LEECH RESEARCH</CENTER>


You probably never thought much about how a leech swims - as long as you
can swim faster. Well, some engineers are studying the way that these
wormlike creatures move in the hope that they might one day help solve some
difficult engineering challenges. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of
the Planet.<P>

Dr. Stephen DeWeerth is an assistant professor of electrical and computer
engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He explains why he
picked leeches as the model for his research.<P>

"First of all, there's been a fair amount of study done on the leech's
nervous system. So that makes it good for us. Each of its individual
segments has a set of neurons that are replicated in each segment
basically, and those set of neurons are interconnected in a very regular
way. And that's what causes the wavelike motion that happens when the leech
swims. And so for us that's very nice, that regular structure helps us to
build models of the leech."<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Motor<P>

That's the sound of a motor being used to drive a mechanical model of leech
locomotion. Dr. DeWeerth figures that if he can actually build a model of a
biological system, he's that much closer to understanding how it works.<P>

"Biological systems are wonderful. They solve tasks that we have no idea as
engineers how to solve right now. I mean you can look at the most complex
system like the human visual system or the simplest systems like swimming
in a leech and just wonder, how do these systems do what they do? Certainly
biology can solve some very hard problems and so we're hoping that we can
find some ways that biology is better than engineered systems are right
now."<P>

That knowledge might someday be used to build better robots, or more
natural prosthetic limbs. We'll hear more in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>LEECH RESEARCH - Applications</CENTER>


The swimming style of the lowly leech is helping engineers learn more about
the mechanics of biological systems, and that information could help them
build better prosthetic limbs. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of
the Planet.<P>

Dr. Stephen DeWeerth is an assistant professor of electrical and computer
engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He and his colleagues
build models that mimic how a leech swims.<P>

<B>ambience</B>, Motor<P>

That's the sound of a motor used to drive one of the mechanical models Dr.
DeWeerth uses in his research. The idea is to learn more about this
relatively simple system of locomotion.<P>

"If we can understand how biological systems work, whether it be the swim
system in the leech or the visual system in a human, whatever. If we can
understand these, we can apply what we've learned to solving hard
engineering problems.  Because obviously, biological systems like a human
hand can do very precise, very careful, very gentle motions, that it's very
hard to get out of a robot, for example. And if we can understand that
control of movement that happens in biological systems, we'll go a long way
to being able to build much better engineered systems."<P>

The research might lead to building better robots, or more useful
artificial limbs.<P>

"If we can understand how the motor system works in a human, we might be
able to build a better prosthetic limb that acts much more like a human
limb and that interfaces to the human nervous system better.  And so even
though right now we're modeling the swimming of a leech, understanding that
motor system will help us understand how a human spinal cord works better
or how a human muscle works better. And all of it will lead to hopefully,
better solutions to the problems."<P>

<CENTER>ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE</CENTER>

Since the discovery of penicillin, antibiotics have saved countless lives. But some 
of the organisms they kill are becoming resistant. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the 
Pulse of the Planet.<p>


<B>ambience</B> gas chromatograph <p>

That's the sound of a gas chromatograph, a device that's used to help identify 
bacteria. Dr. Clay Walker, a professor of Oral Biology at the University of Florida's 
dental school, works with the chromatograph to study bacteria that have developed 
a resistance to antibiotics. <p>


"Most antibiotics either inhibit bacteria or else they kill the bacteria. When we're speaking of antibiotic resistance it that means the bacteria are not affected by the antibiotic in question." <p> 


So how do bacteria develop a resistance to antibiotics?<p>


"The bacteria acquire resistant DNA elements from other bacteria. We may have the transfer of an individual gene or we may have the transfer of a block of genes so that bacteria acquires resistance not only to the antibiotic in question, but also to other antibiotics as well."  <p>

"Resistance to an antibiotic is coded by one or more genes in the bacteria. Now these genes for resistance can be transferred from one bacterium to another bacterium. It can cross species lines, and there's indication that it can pass from man to animals or animals to man. So, the bacteria don't really care who the host is." <p> 


So if antibiotic resistance can pass between humans and cattle, for example, the 
effects could be far-reaching. We'll hear more in future programs. <p>

<CENTER>ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE - Interspecies Transfer</CENTER>

As the use of anitibiotics has increased, more and more bacteria have become resistant to the drugs. Now, a researcher in Florida has found evidence that antibiotic resistance can be passed back and forth from people to cattle. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>

<B>ambience</B> cow sounds<p>

Dr. Clay Walker is a professor of Oral Biology at the University of Florida's dental school.<p> 

"We were looking at an organism that's implicated in diseases in the head and neck. And it has a fairly unique gene that makes it resistant to the tetracyclines. Tetracyclines are a broad group of antibiotics that in the past were effective against most bacteria, but aren't any longer because the genes that code for resistance are so widespread."<p> 

The researchers analyzed the gene for resistance to antibiotics, and they started to look for a similar gene found in the bacteria of other organisms. They discovered one -- in the stomach of cattle.<p>

"And we found that this gene from the cattle and this gene in our oral bacteria, 
were very, very  similar. When we see 98, 99 percent similarity, it means that these 
genes are essentially the same."<p> 

The question is, how did the same gene end up in the bacteria found in both people and cows? <p>

"The obvious jump is, did we acquire this gene for bacterial resistance to antibiotics from livestock. We know livestock in feed lots are given antibiotics to 
promote weight gain. And we know they carry alot of bacteria that are reistant to the 
tetracylines. So we could say, we acquired this gene from the bacteria associated with cattle.  Well, the cattle could have acquired it from us. The guy mixing the feed could have sneezed, coughed in the feed, and put some of his bacteria there which the cattle took in and the gene was transferred to the cattle bacteria."<p>

<CENTER>ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE - Need for new antibiotics</CENTER>

As more bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, the need is growing for new varieties of these drugs.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>

<B>ambience</B> gas chromatograph <p>

That's a gas chromatograph, a device that can help scientists identify bacteria. Dr. 
Clay Walker, a professor of Oral Biology at the University of Florida, is using it to 
study how bacteria transfer the ability to resist antibiotics.<p>

"We refer to it as congregation. Essentially, two bacteria bump together and there is some signal given off and they will exchange DNA." <p>

And with this sharing of information, even more bacteria are able to resist antibiotics. <p>

"I think it's extremely serious. We don't have any new antibiotics in the immediate pipeline. We got rather complacent in the 70s and the 80s, we thought we could treat anything with an antibiotic, and there wasn't an emphasis on pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics, because they're very expensive, it's a long process before they get approved. We're seeing a resurgence of tuberculosis that is very drug resistant. We're seeing a resurgence of bacterial pneumonia, which is also drug resistant. There's a fear that we're going to see more and more serious diseases that are drug resistant, and we won't be able to treat them." <p> 


Another challenge is that as the world's human population becomes increasingly mobile, bacteria have become more mobile, too.<p>


"We can encounter a bacterium somewhere in the world that's resistant to all the antibiotics that we have. It can be transferred to this country, to any other country, and spread very rapidly through the population."<p>

<CENTER>WATER CAR</CENTER>


You've heard of gasoline, diesel fuel and ethanol. Well, now get ready for a fuel 
that's half water. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>

<B>ambience</B> diesel engine <p>

That's a diesel engine being tested at A-55, a company in Reno, Nevada. Its fuel is 
a mixture of water and naphtha, a petroleum by-product. Company CEO Rudolph Gunnerman explains.<p>

"Naptha is a distilled product, clear in color, which comes out of raw oil."<p>

Now, normally oil and water don't mix. What makes it happen in this case is Mr. 
Gunnerman's secret formula - a mixing agent that blends the two together. The result is a fuel that can be used in diesel engines or in spark-ignited engines like those found in most cars.<p>

"This fuel can be used by the general public or fleet operators for automobiles which are spark-ignited. It can be used for lawnmowers, it can be used for outboard motor engines, it can be used for weed whackers. That's on the spark-ignited side. It can be used in diesel engines, for highway building equipment, off-road equipment, or if it is trucks, in all sizes and shapes and forms, or if it is railroads, railroad engines are a little bit larger, and it can be used in those. Eventually we probably can use it also in ships." <p>

Mr. Gunnerman has high hopes for the fuel, which he says burns cleaner than most 
existing fuels and is less flammable. <p>

"It will be less expensive than the existing, it will be safer than the existing, and 
it will be more pollution-free than the existing by at least 50 percent."<p>

<CENTER>CONTRABAND DETECTOR</CENTER>

The x-ray machine has long been a commonplace part of airport security. But x-
rays can't detect everything, so researchers are working on a new way to scan for 
contraband. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>

<B>ambience</B> accelerator <p> 

We're listening to a small particle accelerator at MIT that's the basis for an 
experimental scanning system. Richard Lanza, a research scientist in the Nuclear 
Engineering Department, describes how the system works. <p>

(36.02) "Our accelerator produces particles which then hit a target, and the target  
produces these neutral particles, neutrons. They're the constituent of the nucleus 
of atoms, so they're all arounds us.  The neutrons travel into material, and when 
they hit the nucleus of an element such as nitrogen, they will interact with that 
and in that process give off a characteristic wavelength of gamma ray. And it's 
that energy and wavelength which we detect." <p>

The idea is that if you could analyze the elemental makeup of the contents of a 
suitcase or cargo container, you should be able to determine what's inside. <p>

"We're looking for materials that could be explosives, could be contraband, 
could be drugs, could be whatever. And by using this technique, we're able to 
analyze materials without opening up a container." <p>

The technology would enable security systems to detect what x-rays can't. <p>

"X-rays basically as they function now tell you the shape of things. And 
what they can tell you is that there're materials there which stop x-rays.  And 
that might be for example weapons, guns, whatever. And they're much less able 
however to tell you about plastic materials. And unfortunately we live in a world 
where explosives are plastic.  So traditional x-ray techniques can't see the plastic 
at all." <p>

<CENTER>CONTRABAND DETECTOR - Analyzing with Radiation</CENTER>

A new kind of scanner uses weapons technology to analyze the compositions of 
different materials.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


<B>ambience</B> accelerator<p>

"This sort  of accelerator was originally designed for the Star Wars program, to be the basis for particle beam weapons. And in fact it's designed specifically to have a very high current, to produce a lot of particles and also to be very compact."  <p>


Richard Lanza is a principal investigator in the Nuclear Engineering Department at MIT.  The accelerator system we're listening to produces a beam of neutrons. The 
neutrons interact with the material being scanned, and that gives off a kind of 
radiation which can be detected and analyzed. That enables researchers to identify 
what elements - such as nitrogen or sulphur - might be present.<p>


"The original design here was primarily for security and contraband detection, but we have looked at other things, any place where you want to make an evaluation of materials sort of in a bulk. Our problem is go out into for example, a mine, or the head of a mine where stuff is coming out and find out what's in there in the field." <p> 

The technology could be used in airport security, in mining and in structural analysis, just to name a few possibilities. But wherever it's used, safety is a prime concern. <p>   


"Any techniques, whether it's x-rays or this technique, which is neutrons, any of these techniques are using radiation, and you have to make sure the radiation levels for the general public are way, way down. That's a primary issue. You have to have the radiation and make it safe, you have to make sure you don't put so much radiation in that you could change the contents of somebody's suitcase, make their suitcase radioactive or something of that sort. So those are all issues that have to be addressed, and that's why making a sensitive detector is so important, because the 
more sensitive it is, the less radiation you have to use."  <p>

<CENTER>COMPUTERS LEARN LANGUAGE</CENTER>

As smart as computers sometimes seem, they still can't learn what human children learn by age two or three - how to use language. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


<B>ambience</B> computer says "Mama"  <p>

Dr. Eric Brill is an assistant professor in computer science at Johns Hopkins University.  <p>

"The main hurdle that we have to overcome in order to get a computer to interact with us using natural language - human language - is to get that knowledge of language into the computer. And that's what we're working on here. This is a real bottleneck. How do you teach the computer language? It's an amazing problem. Because somehow, all of us as children trivially learned language, when we were very very young. It was not a painful process, presumably. We all did it successfully, and yet we're having real difficulty getting computers to understand language."  <p>

In an effort to help a computer teach itself, Dr. Brill has given a computer about a 
million words of text from the newspaper.<p>

"If you think back to fifth or sixth grade when your grade school teacher asked you 
to diagram sentences and you could be graded on that, we basically do the same thing. 
The computer is given a large set of sentences that have been diagrammed, so to speak, by linguists, by experts in language, who draw the structure of every sentence. They take sentences from the Wall Street Journal and draw the underlying linguistic structure of it and then the computer can use these structures as a basis to try to learn the rules of language."  <p>

And just like grammar school, the computer is graded on how it learns the rules - how 
well it can apply them to new, undiagrammed sentences.  So far, Dr. Brill says it's been about 85 percent accurate. <p>

"To improve the scores we need to do a number of things. The main thing is probably just to give it more data. "<p>


Once the computer has learned the rules of language, the next step will be getting them to actually converse naturally.<p>

<CENTER>COMPUTERS LEARN LANGUAGE - Natural Communication</CENTER>


If only we could talk to computers in human language instead of having to learn theirs, wouldn't life in cyberspace be simpler? I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


"People have always wanted to have computers understand language. The problem has been that we, as people, although we all know language very well, we don't know what we know. So if you want to sit down in front of a computer and tell it, 'I know language, here's what I know. Let me teach it to you so that you can know it,' that's a very difficult thing to do."  <p>

Dr. Eric Brill is an assistant professor in computer science at Johns Hopkins University. He says the first step in communicating with a computer is to teach it the rules of language. So he's given a computer a million words of text and programmed it to learn those rules by example.<p>


"We'd like to be able to teach computers to learn language for a number of reasons. Mainly because we all speak language very easily. That's the most natural modality for humans. When we interact with people it's natural and pleasant and not stressful because we use language, which we're used to doing. When we interact with computers typically it is stressful and there's a big learning curve on learning how to do that.  And we'd like to overcome that by speaking to computers, hopefully, just like 
we speak to people." <p>

"This means that, first of all, computers could be used by anybody. You don't 
have to be an expert in computers, you don't have to learn a computer language. There 
are no skills that need to be learned. You would just sit down and, for instance, ask the computer, 'I'm trying to find a recipe for baking brownies.' And it would then do the work. And you don't have to be smart to know what the commands you have to give to get this are, you just have to speak in the natural way, just as you would if you were asking your grandmother, let's say, for a recipe for brownies." <p> 


<B>ambience</B> computer says "Here's the recipe."<p>

<CENTER>COMMUNICATING WITH CHAOS</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> controlled chaos <p>

We're listening to the sounds of controlled chaos. Now, that may seem like a contradiction in terms, but a researcher has shown that controlling chaos is not 
only possible - it could be useful. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the 
Planet.<p>


Chaos in its scientific sense is somewhere between order and anarchy. It's a specific type of behavior that follows complex but often predictable rules.<p>


"In a chaotic system such as the electronic circuit that we have here in the lab, the output of the circuit, its wave form, is very complex naturally."  <p>


Scott Hayes is an electronics engineer at the Army Research Lab in Adelphi, Maryland. He's found a way to influence this chaotic electronic circuit using small nudges of power. Once it's under control, the circuit can be made to carry information.<p>


"What we do is we apply very small current pulses to the circuit in a predetermined way that will influence the behavior to carry a certain message. So, the wave form is very complicated in the first place, and we simply influence it to carry digital information by using very tiny control pulses." <p>


This technique could improve communications technology - such as the equipment 
that transmits this radio broadcast  - by making it simpler and more efficient.<p>


"A typical application would be where you needed a transmitter to generate a digital signal, and the output signal needed to be fairly high in power, instead of using a typical technique of amplifying the signal through several inefficient stages, you could produce the signal in one step by having the transmitter be a chaotic electronic oscillator. One example of a possible application of this could be a fiberoptic transmission system where you have a very simple filter that can remove the noise and boost the signal, and retransmit it." <p>

<CENTER>COMMUNICATING WITH CHAOS - The Butterfly Effect</CENTER>

When scientists talk about chaos, they don't mean rush hour traffic or your life on 
Monday morning.  They're describing systems that are complicated - but not random. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <p>

<B>ambience</B> controlled chaos <p>

That's the sound of an electronic circuit at Scott Hayes' laboratory at the Army 
Research Lab in Adelphi, Maryland. A physicist might call the circuit chaotic - but Mr. Hayes has it under control.<p>

"I guess some people would think it is a paradox to think that you can control chaos, but actually it's one of the propeties of chaos that's very important that  makes it easy to control. And that is that any small perturbation, any small tap given to a chaotic system is amplified quickly in time."  <p>

Scientists often explain this property by talking about something they call the 
butterfly effect.<p>

"The butterfly effect is the idea that in a chaotic system, a very small change 
to the system applied at a certain point in time makes the future change in a very 
dramatic way. Something as small as a butterfly flapping its wings now might affect 
the weather system on a global scale six months in the future. <p>

"For example the electronic circuit that I have in my lab is very sensitive to tiny current pulses injected into one of its capacitors, so we can inject these tiny current pulses  and influence the behavior of the system, and that's precisely because it's sensitive to these small perturbations. So one of the properties of chaos, the fact that it's very sensitive to these small perturbations is what makes it in some sense easy to control."  <p>


Why control chaos? Well, a chaotic circuit could lead to better communications 
technology.<p>

"The small control pulses that we apply to the circuit, like the flapping of the 
butterfly's wings have a tiny effect on the behavior at the time that they're done, but in the future they influence the behavior in a dramatic way, and we can cause it to carry a certain sequence of information." <p>

<CENTER>ELECTROSTATIC FIELD SENSING - Music</CENTER>


It may one day be possible to control a computer with just a wave of your hand. 
I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <p>


Peter Rogers is a researcher at Hewlett-Packard's lab in Bristol, England. He and 
his colleagues figure that, as computers get smaller, it's going to be harder to use 
a keyboard or a mouse to communicate with them.<p>


"So you have to think of new ways of using what's available to get information into the machines.  And one way is to think about using the space around devices as the control region."  <p>


Mr. Rogers is studying a way to control computers by generating an electric field  
around them. He demonstrates using a musical computer program.<p>


<B>ambience</B> music  <p>

"This is the musical director, which is a demo which allows us to wave our arms in the air and by doing so we can control the tempo that a piece of music is played. We've got two sets of electrodes, and as I move my hands through the field, 
when I cross the midpoint between the electrodes that's when the beat of the next 
bar comes along. And so by doing that we can very naturally alter the tempo of the 
music."  <p> 


"So as I move my hand backwards and forwards, at the moment I'm playing quite slowly, and then I can build up the speed by moving faster, or I can go ridiculously fast, or I can go back to slow. And all I'm doing is just moving my hands backwards and forwards as though you could imagine I just conducted the orchestra in front of me." <p>

<CENTER>ELECTROSTATIC FIELD SENSING</CENTER>

If you're working on a computer, be it desktop or laptop, it's pretty easy to control 
with a keyboard or a mouse. But how will you communicate with the computer of the future when it gets even smaller? I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


Peter Rogers works at Hewlett-Packard's research lab in Bristol, England. He's 
developing a technology that creates an electric field in the space around a machine, such as a computer. The user just has to move a hand or finger through that space to control the device. The electric field is generated between two copper plates.<p>


"As the user puts their hand into the region between the two plates, they distort the electric field which is there. They take the current away from the electrodes. And so we measure that loss of signal and use that as our control information." <p>


Mr. Rogers demonstrates how this technology can be used to manipulate information on a palmtop computer.<p>

<B>ambience</B>  swishing of finger over Velcro <p>

"A palmtop is basically a miniaturized PC. In the hinge of the palmtop we've put some electrostatic sensors using exactly the same technology. As I stroke my finger across the Velcro, which is defining where the sensors are, I can then use that to give me page turning in an application."<p>

"What I do is by moving my fingers as though I was actually lifting pages and turning them over as you would with a book, we can control page turning on the screen of the display. So we can see the display flip pages as I just move my hands across the sensor, very much as though I was interacting with a book. And this allows you to quite rapidly flip backwards and forwards through a book and get information much more quickly than you would be able to with just cursor keys."  <p>

<CENTER>U.S. FIRST - The Robots</CENTER>


An annual contest brings robots together on a playing field to compete in a game of 
skill and strategy. But the real skill comes from the teams that build the robots. 
I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>

Eric Rasmussen is the technical coordinator for U.S. FIRST. Since 1992, the 
organization has run a competition that challenges teams of enginers and students to build robots for a specified task. The 1996 challenge was to get balls into a five-foot high goal. One of the prototype robots for '96 is called the Elf.<p>

<B>ambience</B> Elf <p> 

"This robot was created to pick the large balls up  off the surface of the playing field or the side of the goal, sort of bear hug them and put them into the goal to score a lot of points."<p>

Another robot prototype took a very different approach.<p>

<B>ambience</B> Boomer <p>

"This robot is called the Boomer, mainly for the large boom that extends out the front side of it. It rolls the ball over the top and into the goal, using the boom. It also has a small blue scoop in the front which is used for picking up small balls off the surface of the playing field and then it will transport those to the player on the side of the field who can then literally throw them into the goal." <p>

Dean Kamen is the founder of U.S. FIRST.<p>

"The goal in how we make our rules is to create a headache for the engineers. We want to make sure when they look at the goal and they look at the game, they can come to at least three or four very divergent strategies that are plausible, the goal being that when all the teams show up, their machines are very very different in design and strategy. There is no right answer, there's just room for a lot of imagination."  <p>

<CENTER>U.S. FIRST - The Game</CENTER>

Since 1992, engineers, students and a diverse group of robots have gotten together 
once a year for a little competitive technology. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the 
Pulse of the Planet.<p>

<B>ambience</B> Elf  <p>

That's the Elf, one of the prototype robots for the 1996 U.S. FIRST competition. The 
event challenges teams of engineers and young people to design and build robots to 
perform a specified task. U.S. FIRST founder Dean Kamen explains.<p>

"Each team is supplied literally with a tub full of about 85 pounds of parts which includes motors, gears and servos and radio control equipment, most of which is supplied by all our sponsors. It's a lot of exciting engineering materials, and about a 25-page rule book with a diagram of the field and a set of all the restrictions on how they're allowed to compete." <p> 

In 1996, playing on a hexagon-shaped field, the robots had to move balls of different sizes into a 5-foot-high goal. The robots' task changes every year.<p>

"The first year they played on a field about the size of a boxing ring that was covered with about two inches of slippery unpopped corn, and they had to pick up tennis balls and move them into a goal about two feet square. The second year they had kickballs, and they had to get them into the air and up over a hurdle about a foot high."  <p>

The students and engineers form a partnership in their quest for victory. Usually the students come up with the ideas and leave it to the engineers to make it happen. <p> 

"The students I think really learn a lot about what's possible with engineering and the engineers rediscover how much fun it is to be an engineer and to have the kind of knowledge that allows you to do these kinds of things." <p>

And that's Boomer, one of the prototype robots for the 1996 U.S. FIRST competition. The event teams engineers with young people to build robots to compete in a kind of science Super Bowl.<p>

"We said, let's steal from the playbooks of sports and put in front of kids the NFL of smarts, and just as little kids aren't induced to play football by watching other little kids play, they like to see the best 200 atheletes in the world do it, we said let's go to the best companies in the world, and find the best technologists in the world, and put them on center stage for these kids, let's let the kids participate with them in exciting projects, in inventing and creating robots that can go and compete in an event that's as exciting as any other other sporting event, and that's what our competition's all about."  <p>

"What I think this country really needs is an awareness, particularly by young kids, that it's fun. Because no matter how much you change the curriculum, when a third of the kids in the major cities are dropping out of high school, no matter what you change on the supply side, if there's no fundamental demand for excellence in science and technology like there is for instance in sports, we're not going to be competitive.  A little bit of desire is worth a whole lot of opportunity." <p>

<CENTER>NATURALLY COLORED COTTON</CENTER>

Think of a cotton field, and you probably picture fluffy white cotton balls. Now 
imagine those cotton fluffs in soft shades of green and reddish brown. I'm Jim 
Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


Naturally colored cotton has been around for centuries, but until recently it could 
only be spun by hand. Now, new varieties have been bred that can be machine spun. 
Dianne DeVries Dickerson, a professor at California State University in Fresno, has 
been testing fabric made from the new varieties.<P>


<B>ambience</B> washing machine  <P>
"One of the important features of colored cotton is that when it's laundered it actually becomes darker in color instead of fading like conventional dyed cottons do. So in addition to already being colored, at least for a period of time, the color actually gets darker and darker. The theory is that the lumen, the molecule where the color is present actually becomes more transluscent and so more of the  color is actually seen than prior to the laundering process." <P>


"We have found that about five additional consumer launderings will pretty much 
bring the color all the way out. And then after that it tends to go back to it's little lighter shade, but it's very minimal." <P>


Now don't expect to find electric blue or fire engine red. The natural cotton colors 
are muted and earthy. <P>


"There are shades of brown, everything from a light brown to a reddish brown. The green varies from a yellowish green to a more bluish green. And the green probably changes color most after laundering." <P>

interest as the raw material for some environmentally friendly fashions.  I'm Jim 
Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <p>


Naturally colored cotton has been around for centuries, but until recently the fiber 
was too short to be spun by machine.  Dianne DeVries Dickerson is a professor at 
California State University in Fresno.<p>

"It could be hand spun and it was used by hand weavers and hand spinners, but it wasn't commercially viable. Now the fiber is long enough, the quality has been improved to the point where the staple length is longer and it can be be machine spun."<p>

<B>ambience</B> abrader<p>

That's the sound of an abrasion machine, one of the devices Professor Dickerson is 
using to test colored cotton fabric for durability and other qualities. She explains 
why naturally colored cotton may be a little easier on the earth than other fibers.<p>


"Naturally colored cotton does not have to be dyed. And during the dyeing process there are some toxic chemicals, some heavy metals that are used in setting dyes, that have to be filtered out of the water system before it can be returned to the environment. Also, the dying process uses energy as well as water. So if they 
can eliminate that dyeing step then they have used less energy and they have used 
less water."<p>


Despite those savings, colored cotton garments will cost a just little more than 
other cotton clothing. <p>

"We feel that part of the acceptance of this product and other environmentally  friendly products is to get consumers to think beyond just, 'I like this because of the color and the way it looks.'" <p>

<CENTER>MEDICAL HOLOGRAMS</CENTER>


First, there were X-rays, then CAT Scans and MRIs. Now, a new device takes medical imaging into the realm of three dimensions. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


<B>ambience</B> Vox Box<p> 


That's the sound of a new kind of imaging system which is transforming, in this 
instance, CAT scans and MRI pictures of a patient's skull into a 3-D hologram. 
Allan Wolfe is president of Voxel in Laguna Hills, California, makers of a device 
they call the Vox Cam.<p>


"Typically one would make 18 to 35 individual pictures, each being a slice of 
the skull. That data is transmitted to the Vox Cam as a series of electronic 
signals. The Vox Cam takes the first input, which is the very first slice, and makes 
a hologram of it from a particular distance. Also encoded is the distance between 
that slice and the very next slice. Inside the Vox Cam, the projector moves that 
distance and then the second slice is projected, and a hologram is made of that 
second slice and superimposed on the first one. And so on and so on and so on. So 
we now have 35 individual holograms, but they're all on the same piece of film. 
When we reconstruct them, our eye blends them all together and we see the volume 
as it existed in the patient." <p>

Dr. Wolfe says the system gives doctors a kind of x-ray vision.<p>


"When I think about this technology, what it does is convert the doctor into 
Superman because what he sees when he looks at one of these holograms is what 
he would see if he were able to see through the patient. And I know that helps him 
to decide more accurately, more quickly, more definitively what is wrong and what 
to do about it." <p>

<CENTER>MEDICAL HOLOGRAMS - Fused Images</CENTER>


A CAT scan takes clear pictures of bone and an MRI displays images of soft tissue. 
Well, a new device combines scans from both machines into a single, three-
dimensional hologram. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


<B>ambience</B> Vox Box  <p>

"One of the characteristics of these holograms is that even though we can 
see all the detail they are indeed transparent." <p>

Dr. Allan Wolfe is the president of Voxel, developers of an imaging system that 
takes CAT and MRI scans and superimposes them to become a holographic image.<p>


"We can put the one on top of the other now we have a complex image that has both 
the bone and the soft tissue. And we know they're exact because they're the same 
patient, they've been sized the same way and they're very easy to fuse, as we say." <p>


According to Dr. Wolfe, neurosurgeons have found the device useful for diagnosing 
back ailments.<p>


"People who have back problems have problems that may be bony or may be in the spinal cord themselves. It's very hard to make a diagnosis. One of the ways that is sometimes used is a process called a myelagram, where a dye is injected into the spinal canal in order to see the spinal cord more clearly.  That's painful and sometimes dangerous. Doctors working with us have been making a CT exam to see the bone,  MR shows the spinal cord quite nicely and when these are superimposed we get a better picture than we get with a myelagram and it's three-dimensional, so the doctor can decide whether surgery is indicated and if so exactly what needs to be done."<p>

Until now, doctors have had to rely on their training and experience to form a 
mental three-dimensional image from the information on a two-dimensional scan. 
Dr. Wolfe says that this new system takes the guesswork out of that process.<p>

"Because if you're going to contemplate doing surgery inside the brain for example, knowing exactly what you're going to encounter before you get in there is extremely helpful."<p>

<CENTER>MEDICAL HOLOGRAMS - Case Study</CENTER>


A new kind of medical device is using holograph technology to construct transparent, three-dimensional images of a patient's anatomy. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


<B>ambience</B> Vox Box  <p>

That's the sound of a medical imaging system developed by the Voxel Company in Laguna Hills, California. The system takes standard CAT or MRI scans and turns them into holograms. Voxel President Allan Wolfe describes one of his holographic images.<p>


"In this particular case we're looking at the top of the neck and the bottom of the skull of an elderly lady who had disease in her bone and whose neck had become very unstable. There was a great deal of concern that the bone would break, it would sever the spinal cord and she would be paralyzed. It was determined that that had to be made more rigid. The question was, what kind of appliance should be used to create that rigidity, and where should it go.  Well, before the patient was operated on a hologram was made, and one was able to determine precisely what size screw was needed to cause the patient's spine to become more rigid, and precisely where to place it. I'm actually placing it into this hologram right now. And after the surgery had been completed we were able to see another hologram that in fact had the screw in it to confirm that we had made the right intervention. I'm happy to say this was a good result."  <p>

<CENTER>DETECTING CANCER WITH LIGHT</CENTER>

A new medical device uses fiberoptics to detect cancer with light. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


<B>ambience</B> clicking shutter <p> 

That's the sound of the shutter on the biomedical spectral analyzer developed by 
Fonet Incorporated. Company president Jan Haerer explains how it works.<p>


"We have a spectrometer, which is a way of separating light into its components, red, green, yellow, etc.  That spectrometer will introduce light from a light source like a light bulb through a fiberoptic. And a fiberoptic is a hair-like fiber of glass. Very, very tiny. We have light that goes into the tissue and then light that is returned. And by studying the colors of light that went in versus the colors that come back, we can determine whether or not we have malignancy in that particular tissue." <p>


Fonet is testing the device to study its accuracy in detecting bladder and colon 
cancer. The fiberoptic procedure is less invasive because no tissue has to be cut 
out. <p>


"If you're not cutting the tissue, then you're not risking bleeding, infection, 
death, metastasis of the cancer, etc." <p>

And the results are available right away - unlike the waiting period patients often 
endure with a biopsy.<p>


"In addition, during surgery, a doctor needs to know, how far do I cut? How far do I have to go in removing a colon, for instance, to know that I have all of the cancer.  One touch with the fiberoptic probe and he would know exactly how much tissue has to be taken." <p>

<CENTER>DETECTING CANCER WITH LIGHT - Accuracy</CENTER>


When a doctor suspects cancer, the standard way to confirm the diagnosis is with 
a biopsy. Now researchers are studying a device that may provide the same results 
without surgery. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>

"When you detect cancer now, you surgically remove tissue in question and analyze it. Now that takes time. Often three days, sometimes as long as two weeks, and if you're on the receiving end, you're sitting there waiting for the report to come back, malignant or not. In addition, there are some risks associated with biopsy as with any surgical procedure."<p>


Jan Haerer is the president of Fonet Incorporated in Clearwater, Florida, developers of the biomedical spectral analyzer. <p>

<B>ambience</B> clicking shutter <p>

With the click of a shutter, the device sends light through a fiberoptic probe to the 
suspected tissue. The light that comes back is analyzed to determine if the tissue 
is malignant.  Fonet is testing the device to determine how its accuracy measures 
up against conventional biopsy. <p>


"In the clinical trials we are actually working with patients, people who have consented to help us with the study. The doctor suspects that they may have cancer in the colon or  bladder. And the doctor is there anyway, he's already performing the procedure. Therefore all we're asking is five minutes to shine the light in and do the testing at the same place that this physician would be biopsying. We're comparing the two and comparing the outcomes."<p>


"The problem is that we are forced to measure against conventional biopsy, and unfortunately, 10 to 30 percent of the biopsies are not accurate.  Anything you 
measure is only as good as your ruler, and we don't have a very good ruler." <p>

Can sick buildings be cured? An engineering professor thinks he's found a way. I'm 
Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <p>


<B>ambience</B> duct system turning on  <p>

We're listening to an experimental duct system in Dr. Yogi Goswami's  lab at the University of Florida in Gainesville.<p>

"The system that we're developing is to clean indoor air, to take care of the sick building syndrome. Sick building syndrome is mostly due to the microorganisms, the mold and mildew and other bacteria that grows in the duct system. In addition, you may have viruses and other bacteria in the air that you would like to clean." <p>

In this test system, an ordinary blower is sending air through a filter that's coated with titanium dioxide, a chemical catalyst that's activated by ultraviolet light. <p>


"Instead of using a regular air filter, we can use a catalytic filter, and that catalytic filter becomes active when this light falls on that filter and when that 
happens, any bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that come in contact, they get killed. At the same time, any chemicals that are in the air that are harmful for us, they get destroyed also." <p>

<CENTER>INDOOR AIR PURIFIER - Airtight Buildings</CENTER>


Airtight buildings reduce energy bills, but they may not be healthy for the people 
inside. A new technology could help. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the 
Planet.<p>

"In the past, buildings used to be very leaky. And they used to waste a lot of energy, but at least we used to get some fresh air in the buildings. Now with the tight building design, that's not the case. So all of the pollution that we have indoors, that becomes concentrated because we are not getting as much fresh air from outside." <p>

<B>ambience</B> duct system  <p>

Dr. Yogi Goswami, an engineering professor at the University of Florida, is testing 
a system he developed to clean indoor air. Air blows through a filter that's coated 
with a catalyst, and when the catalyst is activated by light, the chemical reaction 
destroys airborne contaminants. Dr. Goswami describes some of the pollutants.<p>

"Volatile organic chemicals that you get from various materials that we use indoors, microorganisms that grow inside the ducts, like mold, mildew, and other bacteria that can grow in the air conditioning systems. Because of the pollution in the indoor air, people feel sick, they don't understand why they're not as productive as they used to be. That is called sick building syndrome." <p>


In addition to providing cleaner indoor air for people to breathe, the technology might help to conserve energy.<p>

"Right now, to clean up the indoor air we need to bring a lot of outdoor air to dilute the indoor air pollution problem. And in this case, if we can clean up that  
air, we won't have to bring that much outdoor air,  which requires a lot of energy 
to condition it again to the indoor conditions." <p>

<CENTER>GUIDED WAVE PROBE</CENTER>

When an airplane ages, it may develop cracks and structural flaws. Scientists are 
looking for ways to find structural defects before they cause an accident. I'm Jim 
Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


"Airplanes are made of hundreds of aluminum panels. They're all riveted in place. We all see the rivets as we enter the airplane structure. The airplane skin is probably  up to an eighth inch thick, depending on where it might exist in the structure."<p>


Joseph L. Rose, an engineering professor at Penn State University, is developing 
the guided wave test probe. The probe sends sound waves through the aircraft 
structure, then analyzes the waves to look for flaws, such as those caused by 
corrosion. <p>


"This probe can be used to evaluate fuselage thinning by way of corrosion attack from the inside of the structure. We can take the transducer assembly, place it on the fuselage and by measuring the arrival time of the wave from one transducer to another, come up with a pretty good estimate of the remaining thickness of the structure, which evaluates the corrosion attack." <p>

When the probe finds a flaw, it sounds an alarm.<p>
<B>ambience</B> beeping  <p>

Unlike other ultrasonic probes that only test a small area at a time, this probe can 
test a section that's up to four feet long. And since it's relatively portable, it 
could be used to inspect aircraft quickly in between flights. <p>


"With this new guided wave probe, it's not necessary to schedule complete maintenance for an aircraft. It can be used so quickly that an aircraft, as it comes into the terminal, could have someone within a few minutes take this probe out to a joint,  perhaps something that was repaired some months ago or weeks ago, to get a very quick evaluation on how well it's doing." <p>

<CENTER>GUIDED WAVE PROBE - Aging infrastructure</CENTER>

  
An experimental device that uses sound waves to look for structural flaws could 
be used to help keep aging airplanes in top condition. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is 
the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


Joseph L. Rose is an engineering professor at Penn State University. He and his 
colleagues are developing a portable probe that searches for defects, and sends out 
a warning when it detects a potential problem.<p>


<B>ambience</B> beeping  <p>

"Today with America's aging infrastructure, there's tremendous emphasis being placed on economic efficiency and so on. As a result, we cannot totally replace airplanes. We have to repair and maintain them as well as possible.  It turns out that even though original design lives may call for 20 years, these airplanes can run for 40 years if they're properly maintained. Prior to maintenance, it's critical to carry out a detailed inspection. We have to find out where the problems are occurring, where there's defects, where there's corrosion attack and so on. Fortunately, redundancy in the design of aircraft allows failures of some components to take place without final catastrophic failure, but it's important that we find these early defects."  <p>


The importance of early detection was made clear in 1988, when a 737 lost part of 
its fuselage over Hawaii.<p>


"Because of severe corrosion attack, the entire fuselage and the upper half section of the airplane peeled off. With this incident, many agencies and groups in the United States tried to do something about the safety of the flying public."<p>


With regularly scheduled maintenance and tools like the guided wave probe, airplanes should be flying safely for longer periods of time.<p>

<CENTER>GUIDED WAVE PROBE - Other Applications</CENTER>


Technology designed to find defects in airplanes may also be able to detect other 
kinds of structural problems. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <p>


<B>ambience</B> beeping <p>

That's the sound of a guided wave test probe signaling that it's found a flaw - such 
as rust or a crack - in the body of an airplane.  The probe works by sending sound 
waves through large sections of the structure, and then analyzing the waves. Joseph L. Rose is an engineering professor at Penn State University.<p>


"The guided wave test concept can be applied to almost any structure and any material. The problems solved with respect to hardware and software will be slightly different, but the principles are still suitable."<p>


As infrastructure continues to age, the guided wave technology could be used to 
ensure safety in a broad range of applications.<p>


"Safety with aging aircraft and safety with all sorts of other structures. We can use this in the transportation industry for rail, for an ordinary trolley car. We can use guided wave technology for inspection in power plants. Without a doubt, it will improve the quality of our lives by establishing confidence in the the use of older structures. Also the impact with respect to the cost involved with guided wave inspection will be minimal. The amount of money saved by avoiding catastrophic failure will be immense."<p>

chances are you'll be looking around trying to figure out where the sound is coming 
from. Well, a different kind of siren with a different kind of sound might make it 
easier to locate. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


"The reason we decided to develop a new siren was that every road user you ever speak to reports the problem that whenever you hear an emergency vehicle siren, you haven't got a clue where it's coming from."<p>


Dr. Deborah Withington is the managing director of Sound Alert Limited in Leeds, 
England. Her research in psychoacoustics shows that our brains simply can't locate  
the sound that comes from existing sirens.<p>


"They just don't operate over the right frequency range, and even in an ideal environment, you'd never be able to tell where those sounds came from, let alone 
driving in a tin box of a car. Current sirens are really hard to localize because they contain very few frequencies, and for our brain to be able to tell the direction of a sound, it needs to listen to a whole range of frequencies. Existng sirens operate over a tiny frequency range, between about 500 Hz and 1.8 KHz. but we can actually hear from 20 Hz up to 20 KHz, a huge range of frequencies." <p>

So Dr. Withington's company has come up with a new kind of siren.<p>
<B>ambience</B> siren, localizer <p>

"The best sound for directionality is to use something called white noise. Now white noise contains all frequencies, all the frequencies that we could hear. Unfortunately, it sounds rather like the static on a radio, and is absolutely useless for alerting people, so there'd be no perceived urgency in the sound and nobody would  
respond to it. So we had to create a sound that had both an alerting response and a 
directional component." <p>

We'll hear more about new sirens in future programs.<p>

<CENTER>NEW SIREN - Testing</CENTER>

Researchers in England are working on a new type of emergency siren - one that's 
easier for the human ear to localize. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the 
Planet.<p>

Deborah Withington is the managing director of Sound Alert Limited in Leeds, England. She tells us the first step in the research was to determine how well drivers locate the sound of a standard siren.<p>

<B>ambience</B> siren, wail<p>


"We first of all had to test out the existing sirens, using a driving simulator, so people really felt that they were actually driving. It's a real car. They drove along at 40 mph and we played sound from speakers that were hidden from them, so they didn't know where they were, and then they had to respond to where they thought the sound was coming from. We first of all checked out all of the existing ones and found out that they were absolutely useless. And basically when you're trying to tell, is the emergency vehicle in front or behind me, you get that wrong 56 percent of the time. So we had to try and create new sirens."  <p>


<B>ambience</B> siren, localizer <p>

The new siren uses a typical alarm sound interspersed with bursts of white noise, 
which sounds like static. It's the white noise which contains all frequencies 
audible to people, and according to Dr. Withington, it helps our brain to identify 
where the sound is coming from.<p>


"After the laboratory test, obviously we now need to test it in a real environment.  We've arranged to test it in West Yorkshire, that's in the north of England with the ambulance service, and we'll be testing it in central London with the police department."  <p>

Statistics show just how important it is to find a better sound for a siren.<p>


"We know that last year, for example, there were over 1,300 accidents involving ambulances, and that is just in the London area. We haven't got the exact values for the other emergency services, but we're aware that both the police and the fire services have even more accidents than those involving ambulances."  <p>

<CENTER>NEW SIREN - Designer sound</CENTER>


Hundreds of collisions occur each year because drivers have trouble figuring out what direction an ambulance or police car is coming from. Well, researchers in England have custom-designed a new kind of siren that could make emergency vehicles easier to locate. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<p>


Deborah Withington is the managing director of Sound Alert Limited in Leeds, England. She explains how the research got started.<p>

"Well, the idea's certainly been around in my head for at least the last 10 years, noticing that emergency vehicle sirens are not really well designed for the job that they need to do. But it was the presence of the advanced driving simulator at the University of Leeds that really allowed this project to get off the ground." <p>


The simulator has allowed tests that compare standard sirens <p>
<B>ambience</B>siren, yelp <p>
with the company's newly designed sound. <p>
<B>ambience</B> siren, localizer <p> 

It's a high-pitched alarm interspersed with burst of staticky white noise. The 
white noise - which contains all frequencie audible to people - is what according 
to Dr. Withington, helps the ear find the sound.  <p>


"The new sound we've called initially the localizer gives you a lot of information about the sound, it gives you the direction of the sound in addition to having this perceived urgency. Now, the two phases to the sound, the alerting one, the rapidly rising frequency sweeps and then the broad band burst of noise at the end, we've had a lot of difficulty trying to make it so the frequency component was matched such that the car body didn't influence it and distance didn't influence it. The way we've actually done this is by using computers, we've been allowed to sort of paint with sound. It has allowed us to compensate for all sorts of deficits in high-frequency transmission." <p>

An ambulance service in West Yorkshire, in the north of England, has been helping 
the company develop the new siren. <p>

<CENTER>SOFT TRENCHER</CENTER>


When you think of digging tools, you might imagine a pick or a shovel, or even a backhoe. Well, what about - air? I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Soft Trencher<P>
That's the sound of a soft trencher - a digging machine that uses powerful blasts of air to dig holes without cutting into underground pipes or cables. Richard Nathenson is with Concept Engineering group in Pittsburgh, and he's been helping develop the machine for the Electric Power Research Institute.<P>

"Basically, we use miniature rocket nozzles. If you take compressed air and put it through a properly shaped channel, you will accelerate it to, depending on the pressure, about twice the speed of sound. At that speed the air jet is very energy intensive and capable of penetrating into soil."<P>

The air jets are mounted, along with a vacuum system, onto an extendable boom that the operator maneuvers, much like a conventional grading machine.<P>

"The air jets are basically loosening the material, and the vacuum system is removing it at the same time. This is important because each one really helps the other. The hardest thing for a vacuum to do is actually get material off the surface. That's why your Hoover has brushes. The air jets fluff the material up and make it initially  airborne so the vacuum can then just basically take it and sweep it up into the machine. At the same time, the  vacuum continuously removes material so the air jets always have a fresh surface to work on, so it's really a powerful combination."<P>

According to Mr. Nathenson, the key advantage of the soft trencher is safety. While it's dislodging and removing dirt, it won't damage underground utilities.<P>

"The air jets and the vacuum system are both non contacting. There basically arent any hard edges to do damage."<P>

<CENTER>SOFT TRENCHER - Digging With Air</CENTER>
                     

<B>ambience</B> Soft Trencher <P> 
We're listening to a new kind of excavating machine that digs with powerful air jets. It may sound tough, but it's gentle on buried utility pipes and cables. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P> 
 
"There's a tremendous need today for a new digging technology in urban and suburban areas." <P>  

Richard Nathenson is with Concept Engineering group in Pittsburgh, and he's been helping to develop the soft trencher for the Electric Power Research Institute.<P> 

"The amount of utilities that are underneath the street if you would open it, for example in downtown Pittsburgh or New York, is astounding. There are many, many accidents having to do with contractors accidentally damaging, rupturing a buried line. These are very serious. There is loss of life and millions of dollars of damage." <P> 

The soft trencher uses compressed air that's traveling at up to twice the speed of sound to blast holes in the ground. At the same time, a vacuum system is getting the dislodged dirt out of the way.<P> 

"The key technology with the air jet is that it's very aggressive at dislodging porous materials, like soil, but is completely  harmless to a solid material like a plastic pipe or even fiberoptic line. Primarily to date it has been used in the utility industry, for digging around pipes or cables. Our company is currently exploring use of this technology in environmental applications, environmental remediation  applications and military applications. For in these instances, material which is buried in the ground, such as drums of waste or even unexploded ordnance also has to be unearthed very carefully." <P>

<CENTER>DNA DIAGNOSIS</CENTER>

                                  
A computer chip that contains tiny pieces of DNA may offer a new way for doctors to diagnose diseases. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Electrodes Activating Chip <P>
First, a drop of blood is placed on top of the chip and the chip is electronically activated. The blood sample is illuminated with lasers and the image, as seen under a microscope, is picked up by a video camera.<P>
 
"On the computer screen, we can see the formation of some circles that are getting brighter and brighter and brighter over just a matter of seconds." <P> 

Dr. Tina Berger-Nova is the president of Nanogen Incorporated, developers of the chip.  The bright circles she's speaking of show which of the pieces or "probes" of DNA on the chip match the DNA in the blood sample. <P>

"What this tells us is that the patient sample is positive for some specific diseases that we have put a tag or capture probe down on the chip to measure. In this particular example, we have put a probe sample down for strep throat, so this shows you that this patient has a very, very positive sample for strep throat. On  the same computer chip, we have a probe down for a staph infection and that is negative, so we know that the patient sample has a strep infection and doesn't have a staph infection by looking at this result and we are able to then treat them appropriately." <P> 

The more probes on the chip, the more diseases that can be diagnosed at the same time  - with almost instantaneous results. Dr. Nova compares the matching-up process to  a zipper.<P>

"You have half the zipper immobilized and in your patient sample you have the perfect match for that zipper to come together, and so what you're looking for is to see which two  pieces of DNA are a perfect match for one another." <P>

<CENTER>DNA DIAGNOSIS - One Drop of Blood</CENTER>



Have you ever had to give up multiple vials of blood because your doctor wanted to run multiple tests? Well, a new diagnostic device would require only a drop of blood to check for many diseases at one time. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Electrodes Activating Chip<P>
We're listening to a machine called an automated programmable electronic matrix. Its key component is a computer chip that actually contains small pieces or probes of DNA. Dr. Tina Berger-Nova, president of Nanogen Incorporated in San Diego, explains how it would work.<P>

"A patient walks into the office and we obtain a drop of blood from that patient, which is a very very small sample compared to what's being done today. We then put that drop of blood on top of our computer chip and we then illuminate that chip with a laser, and then in a matter of seconds to minutes, we're able to determine what the patient has and what the patient does not have in a very, very short period of time."<P>  

Dr. Nova says the chip is a little like a checkerboard, with DNA probes for different diseases in each square.<P> 

"What probes are are small pieces of DNA which are known sequences for a specific disease. The patient sample that you're testing also contains pieces of DNA specific for the disease that they have, and the probes in the patient sample then interact with the probes that are on the computer chip, and we have added a dye that allows you to detect which probes on the chip have bound to the probes that are in the patient sample, and therefore giving you a positive result."  <P>

<CENTER>TOBACCO PROTEIN</CENTER>


With all the talk about what's good or bad for your health, tobacco tends to land predictably in the "bad" category. But instead of smoking or chewing tobacco, what if you drank it? I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Blender, Grinding <P>
"You take green tobacco leaves, you put them into a big blender, basically." <P>

Ray Long is a professor of crop science at North Carolina State University. He's studying the possible beneficial uses of a protein that's relatively easy to extract from tobacco leaves.<P>

"You add water which contains a compound to keep the mush then, once it's ground from turning brown. You simply take the mush and squeeze the juice out of it.  And of course it's a green juice at that point. You have to clarify it, that is you have to get rid of the green color and take the chlorophyl out. And what we have left then is an amber colored liquid,  I call it a beer. If it has protein in it, which we hope that it does, if we've done it properly, you'll have a head on it, just like you will on a beer."  <P>

The liquid is chilled, and the protein crystallizes out of solution.<P> 

"Once the extract has been clarified one can extract from that a protein that is highly nutritious. We think that it would be non-allergenic or at least hypoallergenic, so you'd be able to use it perhaps then for infant formulas. And it has some excellent functional characteristics that allow you to heat set it, gel it, whip it, etc., that would be very useful in manufactured foods. You could add it to soups, you could add it to soft drinks to fortify them nutritionally. So from that standpoint we think it would have a lot of utility." <P>	

A little tobacco juice, anyone?<P>

<CENTER>TOBACCO PROTEIN - Uses</CENTER>

 
Is tobacco finally going to get some respect? Scientists have extracted a protein from tobacco leaves that could be used in food products. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>

<B>ambience</B> Blender, Grinding <P> 
That's the sound of green tobacco leaves being ground up in a large blender, so that the protein, called fraction one, can be removed. Ray Long is a professor of crop science at North Carolina State University.<P>

"Fraction one protein is probably the most abundant protein in the plant world. Incidentally it's the protein that is responsible for converting sunlight energy into chemical energy in all plants. It constitutes about 30 percent of the total protein in the green tobacco plant. So we're looking to extract fraction one to use it as a food grade protein in manufactured foods." <P>

Dr. Long believes that fraction one protein could be used as a base for infant formula. Some babies are allergic to the milk or soy proteins generally used in formula. <P>

"So we think that perhaps, because fraction one protein is common in all green plants, and so it's present in all green vegetables that we eat, that because of common nature this might be a source of a hypoallergenic infant formula." <P>

Another possibility would be to try to develop a supplement to for kidney dialysis patients. <P>

"Because of the purity of the fraction one and the absence of certain compounds that have to be excreted by the kidneys one could use it as a source of protein supplement for kidney dialysis patients, and that perhaps, you might be able to reduce the  frequency of dialysis by 50 percent." <P>

<CENTER>SNAIL MEDICINE - Pain</CENTER>


The venom of ocean-dwelling cone snails is the source of a new kind of pain killer that researchers say is 1,000 times more potent than morphine. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>

<B>ambience</B> Drug Being Applied <P>
That's the sound of the drug, called SNX111, being applied to human nerve cells under a microscope. The cells are activated with electrodes to mimic their activity in the human body.<P>

"What we see with the effect of the drug is just what one would see on nerve cells when the nerve cells are still inside the body, that is, a suppression of activity that would correspond to a suppression of the pain signals that occur in the nervous system."  <P>

George Miljanich is the director of biochemistry at Neurex in Menlo Park, California. <P> 

"SNX111 appears to have at least two main advantages over current treatments for pain, for example. First of all, it can treat many kinds of pain that are not treated currently by any known drug, including morphine and the other opiates. Pains that come from tumours, joint pains, those are not very well treated by any known therapies at present. Secondly, tolerance does not develop to SNX111. With morphine and the other opiates, the body has compensatory mechanisms that make it necessary to administer higher and higher doses of morphine to achieve the same level of pain killing, until side effects become unacceptable." <P>

The drug has been synthesized and is being tested on patients suffering from severe pain.<P>

"We've seen dramatic pain relief in AIDS patients, cancer patients. This certainly could be expanded to post operative pain and other pain syndromes, and without the severe side effects of the currently available treatments such as morphine, and the other opiates."  <P>

<CENTER>SNAIL MEDICINE - Biodiversity</CENTER>


For thousands of years, people have derived medicines and cures from plants and animals. And one of the latest creatures to offer humans a new pharmaceutical formula is the cone snail. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

George Miljanich is with Neurex, a company in Menlo Park, California that developing a drug called SNX111.<P>

"SNX111 orginally derived from the venom of sea snails and those snails have evolved a mechanism to paralyze their prey with this venom by injecting it. SNX 111 was one of dozens of components in the snail venom that are each targeted specificallly against different molecules of the prey nervous system."<P>  

<B>ambience</B> Electrical Activity of Nerve Cells  <P>
The venom's components are tested by applying them to human nerve cells under a microscope, and then measuring the electrical response. <P>

"We've relied on a time honored tradition in pharmaceutical science, that is, using natural products as a source for novel drugs. SNX111 was isolated along with many other components of the snail venom because we knew that all of those components would suppress the activity of the nervous  system, and that we felt had great medical benefit... The world's medicine chest is filled with drugs that have been derived from plants, animals and microorganisms. SNX 111 is just another one of those. A new drug could come tomorrow from a pond in your back yard or a tropical rain forest or the coral reefs where cone snails exist, for instance. There's no way to know that. The only way we can maximize the potential for new drugs coming from these exotic sources is to preserve as many of these ecological niches as possible." <P>

"We have in isolation nerve cells on a microscope and we're looking the microscope as we impale the cell with electrodes. The purpose of the electrodes is twofold. One is to stimulate the cells as if they were still part of a nervous system, the human nervous system, and the second purpose is to record the electrical activity as a result of that stimulation, as if they were being stiimulated in a real nervous system. And then we apply the various drugs that we're testing to see how they affect that stimulation, the level of activity of the cells." <P>

One snail-derived drug, called SNX111, is being tested in humans for its potential as a pain killer.<P>

"SNX111 works by blocking proteins in the nervous system called calcium channels. Calcium channels are required for synaptic transmission, that is, for the nerve cells to talk to each other and activate each other. By blocking calcium channels and suppressing synaptic activity, the system is suppressed, its activity is lowered, and  many physiological effects can ensue from that." <P> 

In addition to easing pain, Dr. Milljanich says the drug may be able to protect brain cells after a head injury, or possibly even after a stroke.<P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER CLUBHOUSE</CENTER>
                                 

If children represent humanity's  future and computers the future of technology, it makes sense to get the two together. That's happening in Boston at a place called the Computer Clubhouse. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>

"This is a multimedia movie I made that plays out and then at the end it has... it shows a computer screen with the titles of all the other work I've done." <P> 
<B>ambience</B> Music, Kenneth Willis' movie  <P>
"Now that's showing the beginning credits." <P>

Kenneth Willis, from Dorchester, started coming to the Computer Clubhouse about two years ago when he was 12 years old. This multimedia movie he created features such effects as his own face dissolving into colors and a video clips of  famous buildings and statues flashing by. <P>

"At the end of this movie there's a picture of me holding, it's supposed to be the earth. I have to make more... make it look more realistic." <P>

Mitchel Resnick, a professor at MIT's Media Lab, co-founded the Computer Clubhouse with Natalie Rusk, the director of education at the Computer Museum in Boston. <P>

"It's a place we started in order to help inner city kids have an opportunity to investigate the new world of computers. It's partly just to give them access to this new technology. Many of the kids here never had a chance to use computers before. But more than just access is trying to give them a new way of thinking about technology and a new way of thinking about their own learning. We see a lot of the kids here, they're not just using computers to learn a particular skill, but a sort of a new way that they can create things, a new way to express themselves. And I think a lot of them really get engaged with computers, not so much because there's a particular technology that they're learning, but more because it's a new opportunity for them to express themselves in a way they couldn't before." <P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER CLUBHOUSE - Education</CENTER>


Most children today use computers in school. But too often they don't really have a chance to let their imaginations run wild - to use computers as a tool for their own expression. Well, the Computer Clubhouse in Boston is trying to change all that. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>

<B>ambience</B> General Clubhouse Background <P>
"I think most important, we're trying to give kids a new sense of themselves as learners. Of being able to create and produce things in a way that they weren't able to before. But it's not just learning skills. It's more learning how to express themselves, and to see themselves as very capable inventors and creators." <P> 

Mitchel Resnick is a professor at MIT's Media Lab. He co-founded the Computer Clubhouse to give economically disadvantaged kids a way to learn about computers by following their own interests. <P>

"As you look around, you'll see on the bulletin boards, we have hanging up examples of lots of previous projects. It's sort of a museum of what's been done. On the computers themselves, we have lots of sample projects. So kids can come in and get a sense of what other people have worked on. They then might start by doing a variation on a theme. Take a look at something that someone else did that they like and do a little variation of it. Then they might make a little bigger variation." <P> 

Before long, the kids are doing projects on their own from scratch. The idea is to give them skills and support, and then let them take it from there. <P>

"We give kids  the tools that enable them to create, design and invent. And we've seen that by giving them those  tools, they learn a tremendous amount. They learn partly computer skills. They also learn mathematical and scientific ideas in the process of designing an invention. They write about their designs and inventions. So they're learning English skills. Most important of all, they're learning to see themselves as creators. And for so many of the possible jobs these kids might grow up into, they need to be able to think of themselves as designers in the world."  <P>

<CENTER>COMPUTER CLUBHOUSE - A Place to Explore</CENTER>

You may work with  your computer to create a spreadsheet or do word processing, but have you ever tried to use it to record your own music or build a robot? Well, that's all happening at a place in Boston called the Computer Clubhouse. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience</B> General Clubhouse Background <P>
"When kids come in here, they'll work on a wide variety of projects. If you look in one direction, you might see some kids doing some graphics work where they'll make some artistic creation. Others might be animating their creations, making an MTV-like video. We look in another direction, we see some kids work on robotics projects where they're creating robots and controlling them from the computers. Next to them are some kids that are doing more of a scientific experiment. They have some sensors hooked up to the computer, and they're measuring different types of values with those sensors."  <P>

Mitchel Resnick is a professor at MIT's Media Lab. He co-founded the Computer Clubhouse to give inner-city youths free access to the world of computing.<P>

<B>ambience</B> Rap Beat  <P>
"Back in another corner there's a music studio where kids are making some background beat for some rap music that they're creating. And they're using the computer to help create the music and record the music."  <P>

Professor Resnick says that the clubhouse was designed not only to give young people access to computers, but to provide a comfortable place for them to explore their own creativity. <P>

"Too often when people picture a computer lab, they imagine computers sitting in rows and people in front of the computers just staring into the screen. The clubhouse is set up to have a very different feel about it. In the middle of the room there's this funky green table and the computers are scattered around the room in a way that people can work at the computers but also interact with each other."  <P>

<CENTER>TORNADO ALERT</CENTER>

Each year, tornados cause millions of dollars of damage and the loss of lives. Now, scientists in Mississippi have built a  device that warns of the approach of a tornado. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>

<B>ambience</B> Tornado <P>
Henry Bass is a physics professor and director of the National Center for Physical Acoustics at the University of Mississippi. He explains how the system identifies the particular roar of a tornado. <P>

"The microphone for the tornado alert system sets outside underneath the eave of the home. The microphone is constantly active and constantly listening for any sounds that are out there. The microprocessor inside the control box is listening for the sound that's fed back from the microphone. But it's looking for signals that have a certain range of frequency, namely, low frequencies that are associated with a tornado." <P>

Now, if it hears the right frequency, and the sound is loud enough, the device then determines whether the sound is getting louder over time. If so, it shifts into a potential alert mode. <P>

"It then continues to listen for the increase in the sound level as a function of time, but the volume has to surpass a second threshhold before the processor will then say, aha, I think I have a tornado, and begin to set off a light on the front of the panel and begin to put out a warning sound..."<P>
<B>ambience</B> Alarm <P>
"...This process continues. The longer the source approaches, the more certain the processor becomes that indeed there is a tornado, and the louder the alarm becomes inside the home."  <P>

<CENTER>TORNADO ALERT - Like a Freight Train</CENTER>

<B>ambience</B> Tornado <P>
The sound of a tornado has been compared to the roar of a freight train gone wild. Now scientists have programmed a microprocessor to listen for that sound and warn people when to take cover.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>

Henry Bass, a physics professor at the University of Mississippi and developer of the tornado alert system, describes the sound of an approaching twister. <P>

"Basically what you hear is this fairly low frequency rumble. At first it sounds maybe a little bit  like wind noise through the trees, but it grows in amplitude, and the amplitude increases you begin hear more and more of the rumbling sounds that you would associate with an approaching locomotive. And it gets louder and louder and louder and pretty soon you begin to hear individual trees breaking and other things being thrown up against nearby houses and nearby trees, and it becomes lots of snaps and pops. But underneath all that there's this constant increasing, rumbling and roar that increases in amplitude." <P>

A microphone is placed outside a home equipped with the tornado alert system. It picks up the sound and the device determines if the roar is getting louder. <P>

"The important thing here is that the sound of an approaching tornado will increase with time. Now, down inside of the tornado alert system there is a little computer, and the little computer listens for a sound in the right frequency range that is increasing with time." <P>

If the device hears tornado, it sets off an alarm that gives people 30 to 90 seconds to take cover -- plenty of time, Bass says, if you have a plan. <P>

"It only takes a few minutes. One simply has to think about, where is the safest part of the house to be, get the kids together and say, 'Listen, if I shout tornado, this is where we're going to meet.' " <P>

<CENTER>TORNADO ALERT - The Discovery</CENTER>
                              

<B>ambience</B> Tornado <P>
This rare recording of an approaching tornado was made in 1974 in Alabama, during a severe tornado outbreak that killed several hundred people.  That same series of tornados spurred University of Missisippi researchers to build a device to warn individuals that a tornado is headed their way. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>

Physics professor Henry Bass explains how the idea for the tornado alert system began in 1974. <P>

"A group of us here at the University of Mississippi were talking over coffee, and someone said, if this was a foreign power that had attacked the United States and killed several hundred of our citizens, we would expend billions of dollars in retaliatory action. But since this was an act of God, we were content to essentially do nothing but accept those deaths. And the question was raised, with modern technology, can't we do better? Can't we provide the individual homeowner with some way of having an alarm that will allow them to take shelter to save their lives and to protect themselves from injury?"  <P>

The researchers settled on an acoustic alarm because of a tornado's distinctive sound signature. <P> 

"Our first box, which we built about 1980 was about a half-meter square and cost several thousand dollars. It was only with the advent of microprocessors, with small computer chips that are quite affordable, that this idea actually became feasible. We were able then to squeeze all these large electronic components down into a single chip, and that's what made the process possible." <P>

<CENTER>FALL SAFE FLOORS</CENTER>


A new type of floor is designed to cushion the impact of a person's fall. I'm Jim 
Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


"This is the Penn State Safety Floor. Several years ago we took a careful 
look at the needs of the elderly and particularly how mechancial engineering can 
address those needs. And one crucial area of need for the elderly is injury during 
fall." <P>


Don Streit is an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Penn 
State University. He tells us that the safety floor's cushioning effect is caused by 
a series of columns which buckle under pressure. <P>


"The buckling columns work on the principle, if you could envision taking a 
drinking straw and holding it between your hands and pressing onto the ends of 
that drinking straw. The straw is fairly stiff and it pokes into your hands until you 
put a certain amount of force on, and suddenly that straw buckles and becomes 
soft. That's a similar concept to how the flooring works, in that we have columns 
aligned vertically between two plates. Those columns are fairly stiff when you're 
walking on it, but if someone falls onto the floor, the columns buckle." <P>

"When a person lands on the floor, the columns buckle, they deflect. But the 
columns themselves are elastic, in that they don't permanently deform. So that 
when the load is removed from the floor, the columns return to their original 
shape and the top flooring surface returns to its original shape." <P>

<CENTER>SKUNK SPRAY REMEDY</CENTER>


<P>
The next time your pet gets sprayed by a skunk, don't despair. A chance discovery 
has led to a simple formula that seems to neutralize that persistant and pervasive 
smell. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


Paul Krebaum  is a materials engineer at Molex Incorporated in Lisle, Illinois. He 
and his colleagues were doing research involving chemical reactions that released 
hydrogen sulfide, a gas with an unpleasant odor. <P>


"We were venting this gas up the hood and were getting 
complaints from other people in the building because they were smelling it. So I 
reasoned that it would be better to destroy this gas rather than simply vent it into 
the atmosphere. So after consulting some chemistry texts I determined that 
alkaline hydrogen peroxide had a good chance of oxidizing hydrogen sulfide to 
innocuous components, and that formula kind of stuck in my mind as a possible 
way of getting rid of skunk smell, which is composed of sulphur based materials." <P>

 

Later, when a friend's cat was sprayed by a skunk, Krebaum suggested a milder 
version of the formula. And it worked. The cat was de-skunked. And now, 

here's the formula. <P>


"The recipe for the deskunking formula is one quart of three-percent 
hydrogen peroxide, one quarter-cup of baking soda, and one teaspoon of liquid soap, 
mixed together shortly before you intend to use it, left on the animal for five to 
10 minutes, and then rinsed off with tap water." <P>


A word of warning: Don't store the mixed formula. It gives off oxygen gas that 
could eventually burst a closed container. <P>

<CENTER>GYPSY MOTH PREDATORS</CENTER>



The gypsy moth was first brought to the United States in 1869 under the mistaken 
notion that it could be crossed with a silk worm to produce silk. It turned out to be 
a forest pest with no natural enemies. Well, by introducing some natural 
predators, scientists are hoping to keep the moth population in check. I'm Jim 
Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P> 


<B>ambience</B> beetles trying to climb out of trap  <P>

"We're looking at a trap, what we call a calosoma beetle trap. And it has two 
beetles in it."<P>


Paul Schaefer works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He has been trapping 
calosoma beetles in a woodlot in eastern Maryland. The calosoma beetle is one of 
about a dozen parasite or predator species that scientists have introduced over the 
years to help control gypsy moths. <P>


"There are some extremely small egg parasites that attack the egg stage of the 
gypsy moth. And they will characteristically take from 20 to 30 percent of the 
eggs, sting them, and thereby killing the caterpillers that would normally hatch 
from them in the spring. There are a number of introduced flies and wasps, both of 
which attack the larval or pupal stages of the gypsy moth. And there are a number 
of other predators that are native including our birds and mammals, both of which 
will consume a portion of the population." <P>


Scientists don't expect these natural enemies to wipe out the gypsy moths, but 
they do hope the predators will control the population. <P>


"And we think by increasing the complex of these natural enemies, that overall we 
can keep populations of gypsy moth under a level where we can accept the damage 
that they cause in a forest such as this." <P>

<CENTER>GYPSY MOTH PREDATORS - Unforseen Results?</CENTER>


Over 100 years ago, gypsy moths were introduced into this country with the idea 
that they might be bred with silkworms to produce silk. They didn't. Instead they 
became a major forest pest. Now, with scienstists looking to introduce other 
insects to control the gypsy moth, what's to prevent other unforseen results? I'm 
Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


<B>ambience</B> woodlot sounds <P>

"Part of my responsibility is to see that newly introduced insects 
have little or no possible detrimental environmental impact." <P>


Paul Schaefer is with the Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Lab in the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. <P>


"We're dealing with groups of insects that we know have specific needs. Either 
they are predatory on gypsy moths or are parasitic on them, and their whole life 
cycle is dependent upon the gypsy moth. In that kind of a situation, it's difficult to 
imagine how that particular insect can become a problem in itself." <P>


Mr. Schaefer points to the successful introduction of several species of parasites 
used by farmers to control the alfalfa weevil. <P>


"That program was so successful that we are currently in a situation where the 
alfalfa weevil is much less of a problem than it was back in the 1950s, and 
farmers have been relieved of the damages caused by alfalfa weevils. Just the 
introduction of that little parasite which has managed to establish itself and 
perpetuate itself, it becomes a permanent mortality factor for the alfalfa weevil. 
And farmers continue to benefit from that introduction." <P>

"I'll put them in a traveling container here, and transport them back to the lab." <P>


Paul Schaefer works for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He's been trapping 
calosoma beetles in the same woodlot in Maryland, and then taking them back to 
the lab to study them. <P>


"They are about an inch and a quarter long, very active. They're designed to climb 
trees and to consume caterpillers. They use their jaws to grab the caterpiller and 
they'll tear right through the flesh to get at the softer tissues. The beetle itself is 
very much attuned to the life cycle of the gypsy moth. It spends most of the year 
in the ground. In the middle of May it comes out of the ground, begins to search the 
trees for caterpillers, which it feeds on, voraciously. If they find a lot of 
caterpillers, they will go into a reproductive stage where they will produce 
several hundred eggs that they drop into the litter. And quite promptly those eggs 
hatch into larvae of the beetle. These larvae then develop and will attack the pupal 
stage of the gypsy moth. So it's a one-two punch, the adults feeding on the 
caterpillers, the larvae of the beetle feeding on the pupae of the gypsy moth." <P>

<CENTER>SKUNK SPRAY REMEDY - The Chemistry</CENTER>


Skunks probably think that humans smell awful. We'll never know. But we do know 
that getting sprayed by a skunk is no fun. Now a researcher has discovered a 
simple and effective way to eliminate the stink of a skunk. I'm Jim Metzner and 
this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


Paul Krebaum is a materials engineer, not a veterinarian or an odor expert. He was 
just looking for a way to neutralize the sulphury smell of a gas given off by 
chemical reactions in his lab. He turned to his chemistry books, and reasoned that 
hydrogen peroxide could neutralize the smell by oxidizing the gas. <P>

"The receptors that are in your nose are sensitive to sulphur in its low 
oxidation state, however they are not sensitive to sulphur in its high oxidation 
state." <P>


Krebaum mixed together hydrogen peroxide and a few other household ingredients 
and came up with a formula that deodorized the hydrogen sulfide gas. Now, when a 
friend's cat got skunked, Paul decided to see if the formula could help eliminate 
that sulphury smell as well. And it did. <P>

 

"He had tried all the previous traditional remedies such as tomato juice and things 
like that to no avail. It's my general opinion from hearing people's opinion of 
tomato juice that it simply doesn't work very well at all, whereas this method 
works quite well." <P>


Krebaum said he hasn't found any harmful side effects, and the method does seem 
to hold a cosmetic advantage over tomato juice, the longtime home remedy for 
neutralizing skunk smell. <P>


"We originally thought that perhaps the pet might be bleached and come out white, 
however, people who have tried it have reported that the pet looked essentially 
like it did before the treatment. And it certainly looked much better than tomato 
juice because tomato juice makes them look pink." <P>

<CENTER>TOUCHING VIRTUAL REALITY</CENTER>



Computers have long since entered the dimensions of sight and sound, but can 
touch be far behind? I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>

<B>ambience</B> flywheel  <P>

"This is a sticky flywheel. And I can spin it with my finger and then try 
and stop it." <P>


Thomas Massie is the founder of Sensable Devices in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
He's demonstrating the Phantom, a device that lets a person touch virtual objects, 

objects like the flywheel which exist only on a computer screen. <P>


"I can't see it. And it doesn't exist. But I can touch it with my finger. And when I 
touch it, my finger sticks to it. So there's almost like this friction on top of the 
flywheel. And I can impart momentum to the flywheel. I can spin the flywheel 
faster and faster and faster with my finger. If I try and stop the motion, I'll feel 
the inertia that's built up in the wheel - like for instance, right now." <P>


Massie's finger is plugged into a thimble-like opening in the Phantom.<P>


"So what our device actually does is, it measures where your fingertip is in 
relation to these virtual objects. And they might be buttons or bouncing balls. But 
it measures where your finger is, and then it checks to see if your finger is 
intersecting or overlapping with any of these virtual objects. And if it is, the 
computer says, whoops, this shouldn't happen. And it sends a force to your finger 
through the device so that it pushes against you. To give you the pressure that 
you'd feel if there really were an object there." <P>


Three motors in the device provide the force that acts on the user's fingertip. The 
idea is to create an interaction that's less virtual and more realistic.<P>

"If you think about the way we've been using computers, we have the computer 
monitor to see and we have speakers to hear, but we have nothing to feel yet, and 
that's what this is: the beginnings of something that will let you feel." <P>

<CENTER>TOUCHING VR - Applications</CENTER>



<B>ambience</B> virtual kettle drum <P>

We're listening to the sounds of a virtual musical instrument. It can be touched 
and played - but it only exists inside a computer. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the 
Pulse of the Planet.  A new interface has been designed to give computer users the 
hands-on sensation of actually touching a virtual object. <P>

 

"Computer monitors let us see what's represented inside the 
computer. And speakers let us hear what's inside the computer. We've built a 
device that lets you touch what's inside the computer. You can actually feel the 
models that the computer generates." <P>


Thomas Massie is founder of Sensable Devices in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He's  
demonstrating the computer interface that he calls the Phantom. Plug your finger 
into a thimble-like opening and it simulates, in this case, the sensation of 
touching and playing a virtual musical instrument. And there are plans in the 
works for more practical applications as well. <P>


"One of the most promising applications is to let doctors train on computer 
models instead of real patients or cadavers or animals, for instance. Another 
application would be to let designers actually use their hands when they're using 
computer-aided design programs, instead of just using the keyboard or a mouse. <P>

One of the most interesting applications of the device is being developed at the 
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. They have our device connected to an 
atomic force microscope so that they can actually feel particles that are 10 
orders of magnitude smaller than the workspace that you're operating in. They can 
see these particles which are only about 10 atoms wide on the computer monitor. 
Then using our device to control the microscope they can actually even touch and 
push these particles around. That's one of the more wild applications." <P>

<CENTER>TOUCHING VR - Virtual Medicine</CENTER>




Scalpel, scissors, clamp - mouse? A new device is giving doctors a way to perform 
surgery on virtual patients - complete with the sensations of a real surgical 
procedure. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P> 

 

"This one is actually a simulation of a needle biopsy of the brain. So 
I'm taking the path to push the needle into the skull, or through the skull, and into 
the brain. And I can feel each of the layers pop as the needle, the pressure of the 
needle, goes through the membrane."  <P>

 

Thomas Massie is the founder of Sensable Devices in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
He's demonstrating the Phantom, an apparatus that lets a person touch virtual 
objects. Massie's finger is inside a thimble-like opening in the device, where 
motors and machinery adjust the pressure on his finger to simulate the sensation 
of performing a brain biopsy. <P>  

 

"Now I'm in the tumor, which feels kind of viscous. And I'll extract the needle and 
we can take the sample back to the lab." <P>

 

Of couse, there's no real lab and there's no real patient - just a computer-
generated model.  <P>
 

"Most of our clients intend to use the Phantom to augment these medical 
simulations so that surgeons can practice procedures on virtual patients. And 
when I say virtual patients, I mean a computer-generated patient. Somebody that 
doesn't exist but you can see them on the monitor and you can hear their body 
through the speakers and you can touch their body or cut their body with a scalpel, 
for instance, using our device." <P> 

 

Massie says the device is beginning to be placed in some medical centers, to give 
real doctors a chance to try the simulations. <P>

<CENTER>TOUCHING VR - A Full Sensory Experience</CENTER>



If you're visiting virtual reality, you can now reach out and touch virtual objects. 
It's one more step in making computer simulation a full sensory experience. I'm 
Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


 "I thought it would be interesting to program in the way a button 
feels when it clicks." <P>


Thomas Massie's finger is plugged into a device he invented called the Phantom. It 
simulates the sensation of objects, like buttons and switches, even though they 
don't really exist. Massie developed the Phantom as a student in the Artificial 
Intelligence Lab at MIT. <P>


"This is the light button I'm going to click right now. And now I can click one of 
the harder buttons. Now that button feels almost like a light switch, whereas this 
button feels more like a keyboard." <P>


By modeling the physics of the forces going to the user's fingertip, the Phantom 
also helps to reproduce the sound of whatever it is that's being touched. Massie 
says the sound turns out to be a key ingredient in realizing a full sensory 
experience. <P>


"It turns the sound is just a side effect of modeling the physics correctly. So I can 
feel it and hear it at the same time. It turns out when you take two senses and 
give those to the human at the same time, sometimes the effects multiply, rather 
than just adding to the realism. Because I can hear it as well as feel it, it's much 
more real, many times more real, than if I could just hear it or just feel it." <P>


So are we headed towards a brave new world of total computerized simulation? <P>

"I think that virtual reality is nice, but we're never going to be able to do as good 
a job as nature does in providing feedback. And I think a full body suit that 
provides all the sensations you get from a natural environment is at least 100 
years off. <P>

<CENTER>WATER DIVINING FROM SPACE</CENTER>



In the driest of deserts, the traces of former rivers may remain beneath the sand. 
And those channels - if they can be found - can point to long-hidden reserves of 
ancient groundwater. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


"The ground water in these places is actually old, we'll call it 
fossil, meaning it's been there for a very long period of time from the geologic 
times when it used to rain there. So when we find the courses of ancient rivers, 
we actually find places where the ground water might be." <P>

 

Farouk El-Baz directs the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University.<P>


"Long after the river has dried and its source has dried and rains that form the 
water in these rivers have long gone and the environment has changed and dried up, 
the water beneath the surface is still stored and still preserved. It only requires 
us to be intelligent enough to figure out where it might be." <P>


A radar imaging device on board the space shuttle can help detect these ancient 
waterways. The radar penetrates the sand and offers researchers a view of the 
terrain below. <P>


"The radar wave goes through the atmosphere, hits the ground or the water, is 
reflected back and what is recorded on the film on the spacecraft is the echo that 
comes back." <P>


Even in deserts with no surface water and little rain, there may be groundwater 
that can be reached through wells. <P>


"We use the radar images particularly in areas where there is a great deal of sand 
because the radar has the capability of penetrating through the sand cover and 
revealing to us the first solid rock layer beneath the sand. So if we are looking at 
the sand cover of an ancient river, we would be able to see the course of that river 
even though it is covered." <P>

groundwater in some of the driest spots on earth. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the 
Pulse of the Planet.<P>


<B>ambience</B> space shuttle launch<P>

Farouk El-Baz now directs the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University, but 
he used to work for the space program. In 1981 he asked colleagues at NASA to 
take a radar picture of a part of Egypt's Western Desert. It turned out that the 
radar image taken from space penetrated the sand and produced an image of the 
rock layer underneath.<P>


"Neither they nor I knew that radar would have this ability to penetrate through 
sand and give us a picture of what is beneath the sand. So when the pictures came, 
I began to look at them and I was absolutely stunned at the fact, in this place, that 
I know is absolutely flat and covered by sand and has not rained there at all, maybe 
once every 20 years, it is the driest place on earth and then beneath the sand, 
there are these numerous courses of ancient rivers."<P>


Mr. El-Baz suggested drilling some test wells to see if water from the ancient 
rivers remained underneath the sand.<P>


"Well after well, a great deal of water came through and now, today, there is an 
experimental farm, 10,000 acre experimental farm." <P>


The method has been used successfully in the Sinai, Sudan and other desert 
environments.<P>


"So in every single case, we found water. Most people that live in these desert 
areas, water to them is so critical that it might mean the difference between life 
and death. So, when you go someplace in the middle of a desert and find a new 
source for ground water, then you've done these people a tremendous favor." <P>

may be a way to make sea water drinkable. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse 
of the Planet.<P>


<B>ambience </B> ocean sounds <P>

"The system is called the McCabe Wave Pump Desalination System. It 
is designed to exploit ocean waves by converting their energy into mechanical and 
hydraulic energy and using those energies to produce potable water for remote 
locations throughout the world." <P>


Michael McCormick is a research professor at Johns Hopkins University. He working 
on a wave pump named for Peter McCabe, an Irish civil engineer who thought up the 
idea in the1970s. <P>


"The system consists of three barges. The center barge is held almost motionless 
by a damping plate suspended below it. Attached to this motionless center barge 
are two larger barges which are allowed rotate about their hinges which attach 
them to the center barge. Their rotational motion excites hydraulic pumps which in 
turn draw water up through a fire hose. Those pumps pressurize the water, then 
transport the water to shore and into a desalination system." <P>


The fresh water produced is suitable for human or animal consumption, or for 
agriculture in places where fresh water is in short supply. <P>


"Some of these locations include the over 100,000 inhabited islands throughout 
the world that don't have any natural sources of potable water. There are other 
areas in the third world that don't have natural sources, for example Somalia.  
Somalia has a very long coastline on the Indian Ocean. By using the McCabe Wave 
Pump System, millions of gallons per day of potable water could be supplied to the 
coastal towns." <P>

<CENTER>WAVE PUMP - Water Power</CENTER>


<B>ambience</B> ocean sounds <P>

Ocean waves have been known to create seasickness, sandy beaches, and surfing. 
Now, engineers are finding a way to harness the ever-present motion  of the ocean 
and turn it into energy. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


"One of the sub-systems that has been devised for the McCabe Wave 
Pump is a system to produce electricity for remote locations." <P>


Michael McCormick, a research professor of civil engineering at Johns Hopkins 
University, is helping to develop the McCabe Wave Pump. It's a system of three 
barges linked together off shore. One barge is held motionless, and the movement 
of the other two is turned into energy through a series of pumps. There's enough 
energy to pump the water to shore, remove the salt, and then some.<P>


"The electricity is actually produced by the high pressure water, so we can have a 
dual system which will produce the electricity and the potable water at the same 
time... To get some idea of the value of this, on Lord Howe Island, which is an 
island off shore of Australia and the energy cost is 45 U.S. cents per kilowatt hour. 
For comparison, in San Diego, which is probably one of the most expensive energy 
areas in the country, they pay 13 cents a kilowatt hour. The McCabe Wave Pump 
should be able to produce electrical energy for 12 cents a kilowatt hour, so the 
saving for these island communities is evident." <P>


McCormick says the system should be able to operate most of the time. <P>


"There will be times when you have dead calms at sea and there will be times 
when the waves are so large that you'll actually have to tow the system to a 
harbor to keep it out of harm's way. For the most part, though, the wave are 
always there." <P>

<CENTER>FOOD STERILIZATION - Electric</CENTER>


Anyone who's ever scrambled an egg knows how fast heat can change the taste and 
texture of food. Well, a new technology uses intense electric fields instead of heat 
to kill bacteria in liquid food. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. 
Wayne Clark is president of Pure Pulse Technologies.<P>


"The most prevalent method today for pasteurizing foods is heat. 
And heat does cause a lot of changes, chemical changes, in foods and also changes 
the taste. Fresh-squeezed orange juice tastes much better than canned orange 
juice because canned orange juice has been heat treated. This process, which we 
call Cool Pure, is is a way of killing bacteria without affecting the food or its 
taste at all." <P>


<B>ambience</B> cool pure machine  <P>

The process works best with liquids. They're pumped into treatment chambers and 
passed between two electrodes. <P>


"You apply a voltage across, between those electrodes, of about 30,000 volts. And 
those are applied in a few pulses, as the food flows between those electrodes. And 
you basically electrocute the bacteria...  This is absolutely different from what is 
called food irradiation. There's no radiation here. Basically you're using electricity 
to electrocute bacteria. And it makes no change in the food itself. We've done 
extensive tests to show that. Basically what it means is that you can kill the 
bacteria without damaging the food, without changing its taste, or changing its 
chemical or other physical properties." <P>


Along with destroying bacteria that could cause food-borne illness, the process 
also keeps food from spoiling. <P>


"Well, orange juice can go bad in just a couple of days. We've had orange juice that 
we've treated with this technology that has lasted for a month or more. So it's a 
very significant increase in the shelf life." <P>

<CENTER>FOOD STERILIZATION - Light</CENTER>



Ever since Louis Pasteur developed the process that bears his name, heat has been 
the preferred method for killing  bacteria in food. Now, a new method achieves 
similar results using bright light instead. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of 
the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience </B> lamp testing machine <P>

That's the sound of lamps being tested at Pure Pulse Technologies in San Diego. 
The lamps emit white light compressed into very short bursts. <P>


"This is a completely new process that involves the use of pulses of 
very intense light that are very much like sunlight in their characteristics. The 
difference is that the light is about 20,000 times the intensity of sunlight at sea 
level. So it's a very intense flash of light but very brief." <P>


Wayne Clark is president of Pure Pulse. He says the technology kills much of the 
bacteria on the surfaces of food and food packaging. <P>


"The total energy that's involved is very small, but it's compressed into a very 
very short time. It's sort of like if you went to the beach and you got your year's 
supply of tan in less than a second, you'd probably be less than happy, and the 
bacteria are less than happy." <P>


According to Mr. Clark, the process doesn't affect the taste of the food like heat 
treatment does. And it kills microrganisms that can cause food to spoil. <P>


"So there are really two benefits. One benefit is killing pathogenic 
microorganisms, microrganisms that make you sick like E coli and like salmonella. 
And there are just a huge number of illnesses in the U.S. every year from these 
organisms, and a lot of people die. And so one application is to kill those 
microorganisms that make you sick so that you don't have food-borne illness. And 
a side benefit is that consumers benefit by having longer shelf life and improved 
economy in the food supply." <P>

<B>ambience</B>, Whales, Humpback, Songs<P>

We're listening to the haunting calls of a Humpback,  a member of  the family of 
baleen whales. Scientists are looking at baleen whales to help develop an effective 
way of cleaning up oil spills.  I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet<P>


"We discovered that whales might have microbes that could break down oil spills 
in a very serendipity way. We were working on cows and sheep which are 
ruminants on land. Now ruminants have four stomachs and sheep have microbes in 
it that were  able to break down a plant toxin. From there we then generalized 
other toxins, such as herbicides and pesticides that could be broken down by land 
animals. And then we went and looked at the ruminant of the sea, the baleen 
whales that have three stomachs. And in the first stomach of the baleen whale, we 
were finding microbes that would break down oil spills."<P>


Dr. Morrie Craig is a professor of veterinary medicine at Oregon State University. 
He says that baleen whales can actually use oil as food.<P>


"The oil is broken down by those microbes into short chained hydrocarbons, often 
fatty acids, and then the whale itself utilizes those carbon chains for energy much 
like we would utilize sugar for energy."<P>


The useful bacteria from baleen whale are  anaerobic microbes, that is, they 
survive without oxygen. This can be effective for cleaning up oil when it seeps 
under rocks and into other areas which are not exposed to air.<P>


"The way that you'd apply these microbes is you'd grow them up in a large vat. But, 
they could be poisoned if exposed to air. So they have to be protected from the 
oxygen and then they would just be in fact applied, salted over an area, and if they 
get into an anaerobic, or non-oxygen, area then they could grow up on the oil that 
was there and proliferate." <P>

<B>music</B>

<B>ambience</B>, Whales, Bowhead<P>

We're listening to the sounds of a Bowhead whale, a species in the baleen family of 
whales. Scientists recently discovered that microbes found inside the stomachs of 
baleen whales may actually be able to break down oil spills, and now they're 
developing a way to incorporate these microbes into current cleanup methods. I'm 
Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


 "In a spill like the Exxon Valdez, you have the oil that ends up on the surface, and 
there you'll have microbes that are able to break it down which come right from 
the ocean themselves and the waves action and you can break down the surface 
components of the oil. When you get underneath the rocks and down into the area 
where there is no oxygen, in those particular places, you need a microbe that can 
live without oxygen and those are anaerobic microbes. And those are the microbes 
that you find in the forestomach of the whale. And it is those type of microbes 
that would be necessary to break down the components of oil underneath the rocks 
and in the anaerobic zones."<P>


Dr. Morrie Craig is a professor of veterinary medicine at Oregon State University. 
He says the whale microbes could be used to help clean up a variety of oil spills.<P>


"You have lots of little cleanups that happen right around the place where you're 
processing oil, where whenever you change a pipe or what have you, 50 gallons or 
100 gallons get spilled. And if they had microbes that could work without oxygen, 
in that particular area would be very helpful. This is where they're trying to put 
the commercial application." <P>

<B>ambience</B><P> Ocean Drilling Platform (DAT) and ocean sounds (90.6.30-2 
Reeves)<P>

We're listening to the sounds of the machinery aboard a drill ship. Its mission is to 
explore the deep sea bed for clues as to how the earth works. I'm Jim Metzner and 
this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


Reel, cut 2) "We can suspend a drill string up to about 8 kilometers long beneath 
the ship. That's about five miles long. More typically we'll be employing drill 
strings of three or four kilometers, say two, two and a half miles in length, to 
sample these sediments and rocks on the ocean floor." <P>


Dr. Tim Francis is deputy director of the Ocean Drilling Program.<P>


c8) "One picture of the earth's geology is that it's like an orange with a peel on the 
outside. And that peel we call the earth's crust. The earth's crust is only about five 
kilometers thick beneath the oceans, but on land it's something like 30 to 40 
kilometers deep. Once you get beneath this peel of the orange, or the earth's crust, 
you're getting into the mantle rocks of the earth. And they compose a large part of 
the earth's volume. The Ocean Drilling Program has found a few rare places on the 
bottoms of the ocean where these rocks are actually exposed on the ocean floor. 
Normally they are buried at depths which are too deep to be recovered by drilling."<P>

c9) "Among the reasons why it's important to study these deeper rocks which are 
not exposed frequently on the earth's surface is many of the earthquakes which the 
earth experiences are occurring in rocks of this nature. Another reason is it is in 
these rocks where many of the minerals that we recover on the earth's surface for 
economic purposes, find their origin." <P>


We'll hear more about ocean drilling in future programs.<P>

<CENTER>OCEAN DRILLING PROGRAM - Prospecting on the Ocean Floor</CENTER>



<B>ambience</B> Ocean Sounds<P>

Millions of holes have been dug in the state of Texas alone as prospectors search 
for oil - but in the entire ocean floor, far fewer holes have been drilled. Now, a 
scientific expedition is seeking to mine the sea bed. And while they're not looking 
for oil, what they find may lead to better ways of prospecting for valuable 
minerals on land. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


Reel, cut 5) "The oceans are not like a goldfish bowl, you know, with a watertight 
container holding them. The sea floor is not watertight so you get sea water 
passing into the sea floor and then coming out of it again. And that has a major 
influence on many of the processes happening on the ocean floor, and it also has a 
major influence on the chemistry of the oceans as well."<P> 


Dr. Tim Francis is deputy director of the Ocean Drilling Program. In one recent 
expedition, scientists tunneled into a mound of minerals that was created by an 
undersea hot spring. It's believed that many of today's valuable minerals, such as 
copper and zinc, were created by deep ocean vents such as these.<P>


c6) "As the sea water goes down through the rocks, it leeches out various 
elements from the rocks themselves and it becomes more acid. And then it 
eventually comes up again as it's heated up and becomes more bouyant. It comes up 
and emerges on the sea floor as a hot spring on the sea floor. And when it meets 
the cold sea water on the bottom of the ocean, it discharges its load of minerals in 
solution and produces this mound. So that's a process that's going on all along the 
mid ocean ridges around the world. And it's thought to be the way in which many of 
the minerals which we now mine on land, originated." <P>

c7) "I think the real benefit from studying this mineral-creating process on the 
ocean floor is that it'll help us to understand how these ore deposits are formed on 
land and therefore it'll help us to find them on land. That's where the economic 
return, I think, will come over the next several decades." <P>

<CENTER>OCEAN DRILLING PROGRAM - Climate Models</CENTER>


<B>ambience</B>Ocean Drilling Platform (95.11.7) and  ocean sounds (90.6.30-2 Reeves)<P>

The sounds we're listening to were recorded aboard a drilling platform on the deep 
ocean. By tunneling into the ocean floor, scientists are uncovering a geologic 
record of the earth's climate. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


Dr. Tim Francis is deputy director of the Ocean Drilling Program.<P>


Reel, cut 3) "In general, when you're talking about sediments on the ocean floor, 
they tend to be very fine grained and very porous with perhaps 60 to 70 percent of 
their volume is in fact seawater. And many of them are built up from the skeletons 
of plantonic creatures which used to live up in the sea surface. So by going down 
through the sediment column in the sea bed, you are going back through geological 
time. And you can learn an enormous lot about how, for example, the surface 
temperature of the sea and productivity of the sea has varied through time. And if 
you carry out this process in a large number of sites around the world, youcan 
build up a picture of climate change going back through geological time for many 
millions of years." <P>


Dr. Francis says this research could be used to help track global warming and the 
other potential effects of pollution.<P>


c4) "Now, in order to determine what effect these man-made effluents will create, 
one has to construct computer models of climate change, and put in all of these 
parameters that will effect climate, such as carbon dioxide concentration in the 
atmosphere. The problem with this approach is that one has to be able to test 
these computer models and see whether they reflect the way the world works. The 
world's climate is a very complicated system. By obtaining detailed records of 
climate change back through time, we can provide real data of climate change 
which can then be used to allow us to test these computer climate models to see 
whether they are realistic." <P>

under the English Channel. Well, it took nearly 200 years and over 12 billion 
dollars, but the Channel Tunnel is now a reality. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the 
Pulse of the Planet.<P>


Today it's an army of millions of tourists, commuters and their cars who use the 
Chunnel every year. <P>


(Reel #1)"At the moment, we're standing at the end of one of the loading platforms 
on the Folkestone Terminal. This is where the cars and lorries will load and unload 
from the shuttles."<P> 


Richard Storer is Manager of Buildings and Infrastructure for Eurotunnel, operators 
of the Channel Tunnel, or "Chunnel." He's showing us around the Chunnel terminal in 
England.<P>


"This shuttle train is about half a mile long and weighs up to 2,000 tons."<P> 

"The shuttle trains have been designed to carry vehicles on rail tracks through the 
tunnels. The locomotives are fairly conventional, although they're pretty powerful 
locomotives. The carring wagons for the tourist vehicles, have been designed to 
carry 120 cars or 12 coaches."<P>

"We're now standing in the middle platform where the unloading of the rear section 
takes place and the loading of the front section. The shuttle has arrived about four 
minutes ago and the cars are already coming off through the side loading door, 
from both the bottom and the top decks. The vehicles load at one end and drive 
right the way through to the front of that particular part of the shuttle. So the 
first vehicle on drives all the way through and stops and when the shuttle arrives 
at the destination terminal that vehicle is the first one off."<P>

<B>ambience</B>Train Station-Channel Tunnel (Reel#2)<P>

The Chunnel, a 31-mile tunnel connecting England and France across the English 
Channel, is an engineering marvel of the 20th century. And today we'll hear about 
some of the technology that made it possible. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse 
of the Planet.<P>


(Reel #1) "First of all, it was very important to make sure that both sides knew 
where the other was down to a millimeter. And so satellites were used to set up a 
survey grid across the Channel to ensure that both teams started from a known 
point. <P>


Richard Storer is Manager of Buildings and Infrastructure for Eurotunnel, builders 
of the Chunnel.<P>


"Computers were used to dictate where the tunnel boring machine should be and 
the information as to where they should be when was programmed into them so a 
guidance system was developed running along the tunnels behind the machines, 
which allowed them to be steered accurately because of course they were going to 
meet in the middle. And it was impossible until they met, and breakthrough 
occurred, to actually survey through the tunnel to check that it was right. I think 
the proof of this system is shown by the fact that when the first machines met, 
they were only a few inches out."<P> 

"The trains use an overhead electric wire system, 25 kilovolts, produced from the 
national grids in both the UK and France. And the power is then transferred to the 
locomotives through an overhead wire collection system. They just propel through 
on standard gauge rails between the U.K. and France." <P>


Mr. Storer also says the chunnel is a smooth ride.<P>


"The track base within the tunnel is a concrete track base. And so there's no 
movement of the tracks as the train goes over, as you get with a conventional 
ballasted track. And so the ride within the tunnel is extremely smooth."<P>

<CENTER>CHUNNEL - Safety Concerns</CENTER>


<B>ambience</B>ambience Train-Channel Tunnel (Reel#2)<P>

We're in a British railway station where a shuttle train is embarking on a 31-mile 
trip under the English Channel to France. The Channel Tunnel, or Chunnel, 
transports millions of passengers and their cars along this route every year. And 
as you might imagine, the technology and support systems necessary to keep this 
cargo safe were developed long before the first train made its historic passage 
through the tunnel. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Richard Storer is Manager of Buildings and Infrastructure for Eurotunnel, builders 
of the Chunnel.<P>


(Reel #1)"The tunnel is never going to flood."<P>

"There's a lot of rock above the tunnel before you get to the sea bed - about a 
minimum of 45 meters, a maximum of about 75 meters - and the tunnel is in solid 
rock all the way across. So there is no likelihood of the sea ever coming into the 
tunnel. There are, however, problems of a fire in the tunnel because we're carrying 
internal combustion engine vehicles within an environment where people are also 
mixed with them. Therefore, safety of the passengers and the users has been 
uppermost in the design of the shuttles and the system in which the shuttles 
operate. This must be the only rail tunnel in the world which has a fire main 
running right the way through it with fire hydrants every 125 meters, a service 
tunnel running right the way along the whole length of the system, so that access 
can be obtained every 375 meters by emergency crews if necessary. We have 
smoke and heat and flame detecters, carbon monoxide detecters, which will alert 
the control center if there are any problems within the tunnel itself." <P>


The Chunnel system also has extensive security measures against terrorism, 
including an electronic device that can help detect trace amounts of explosive 
molecules in parts per billion.<P>

<CENTER>AIRBAGS - Smaller and Better</CENTER>


<B>ambience</B>airbag inflating<P>
                                   

That's a sound most of us hope we never have to hear - the sound of an airbag 
inflating. Airbags have been shown to reduce fatalities in car crashes, and now 
researchers are finding ways of making them smaller, lighter and safer.  I'm Jim 
Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


"A traditional airbag is constructed from two circular pieces of fabric and has a 
circumferential seam, then."<P>


Jim Nelson is a member of the senior technical staff at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico.<P>


"Our bag is constructed from one piece of fabric. It starts out as a square pattern and the edges get folded in towards the center.  And  we have linear
seams, then, which run down those edges."<P>

The seams follow the direction of the weave of the fabric, so that the bag is
strong enough even though it's lighter than most current airbags. The custom fabric is similar to material used in making parachutes.<P>


"Parachutes suffer from the same type of problems that airbags do, in that
you want higher performance but you always want to go smaller. Typically if we 
can go in smaller volumes, which for us translates to lighter fabrics, it downsizes 
everything else associated with the system. The tray that it goes into is smaller, 
which means less material, the support structure is smaller. So when you consider 
the airbag system as a whole, this technology probably will end up decreasing the 
cost of the airbag system."<P>


The reduced size also means that the airbags may be used in places where they're 
currently not found.<P>


"We anticipate implementation oif this airbag in other ground transportation 
vehicles such as buses, trains and potentially into planes also."<P>

<CENTER>AIRBAGS - Softer, lighter, faster</CENTER>



When a car crashes, an airbag has to open in milliseconds to keep the occupants 
from slamming into the steering wheel or dashboard. Using fabric technology 
developed for parachutes, researchers have designed an airbag that's smaller, 
smoother, lighter - and faster. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


 "Airbags in the commercials have this soft, billowy unfolding, but in reality 
they're coming out in like three to four thousands of a second."<P>

<B>ambience</B> airbag inflating <P>


Kenneth Gwinn works in solid and structural mechanics at Sandia National

Laboratories in New Mexico.<P>


"Normally an airbag comes out and it inflates very quickly, it hits the passenger a 
little bit, it's called face slap. And our lightweight fabric reduces this phenomenon 
to be really non-existent. The lightness of the fabric relates to a reduction in the 
forces that are put on the person when the airbag inflates. In addition the fabric is 
very smooth and very silky. It reduces greatly the damage to the skin of your face 
during the accident, because the existing fabric is fairly coarse."<P>


The lighter fabric also means that a packed airbag takes up less than half as much 
space, so it can more easily put in other places besides the steering wheel or 
dashboard.<P>


"Because it's smaller you can tuck it into the side of a car easier, you can tuck it 
into the top of a car if you want to do that, you can put it into the rear of the front 
seat so the people in the back seat are now protected. You  can envision a lot of 
places this airbag could  fit."<P>


Researchers expect these airbags to be standard in most cars in the next five or 
six years.<P>

<CENTER>BRIDGE SAFETY - Inspecting with Sound</CENTER>



With the help of sensitive microphones, scientists are inspecting bridges for 
cracks and structural flaws by listening to them. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the 
Pulse of the Planet. <P>


"Bridge inspection has traditionally been done by human visual inspection. That 
type of inspection, while it can be fairly effective with a highly trained, dedicated 
inspector, leaves a lot to be desired."<P>


David Pryne is a research scientist with the Birl Industrial Research Laboratory at 
Northwestern University.<P>


"There's a lot of problems in bridges that you can't see, so a visual inspection 
won't really find them, or if it does find them it doesn't find them until they 
progress to the point where the damage has become very severe, and now we're 
looking at instead of minor remedial repairs, major structural damage has been 
done so we've got to do big time repairs. So what we're doing here at Northwestern 
is using some of the new technology that's being developed for non-destructive 
testing,  non-destructive evaluation. One of the tools we're applying to bridges, in 
this case steel bridges, is acoustic emission monitoring."<P>

Acoustic emission monitoring means listening for high frequency sounds which 
indicate the bridge structure is under stress.<P>


"When a piece of steel cracks high frequency sound is emitted. If we have the    
proper sensors attached to the piece of steel we can pick up those sound waves."<P>

<B>ambience</B> acoustic emissions (95.11.12)<P>

"Most of these cracks, though, are benign. They're not being driven by the live 
loading on the bridge, so they're not likely to propogate and cause any harm. 
However, there are cracks that do grow under the live traffic loading. And those 
are the ones we want to catch, those are the ones you have to spend the money on 
to fix. And one of the  very powerful things you can do with acoustic emission is 
determine whether or not a crack is in that category."<P>

<CENTER>BRIDGE SAFETY - Listening For Cracks</CENTER>

There are nearly 600,000 bridges in the United States and most of them are 35 to 
40 years old. Using high frequency sensors, scientists are monitoring the bridges 
for structural flaws. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


(95.11.12) "The device that we're looking at here is an acoustic emission 
monitoring system. Its purpose is to receive high frequency sounds from materials 
that are undergoing stress. We have sensors which are contact microphones, very 
high frequency, coupled to a piece of steel. And what we're looking for are the 
sounds that are emitted from cracks growing in the steel as the bridge undergoes 
its normal live stresses from traffic."<P>


David Pryne is a research scientist with the Birl Industrial Research Laboratory at 
Northwestern University.<P>


"Acoustic emission monitoring reduces to the problem of extracting the desired 
sounds, in this case the sound of a growing crack, from a background of noises, 
which on the bridge would be the noises generated by the traffic running over the 
bridge. The way we do this is with a very sophisticated form of pattern 
recognition in the computer. We capture these signals and they're digitized and 
analyzed by the computer, and then plotted out on a computer display. The display 
shows us where the sounds are coming from, and we locate the sources and then 
we perform fairly sophisticated pattern recognition on the signals to decide 
whether or not it's coming from an active crack."<P>


<B>ambience</B> acoustic emissions (95.11.12)<P>

These sounds are typically well above the range of human hearing, but we've been 
able to translate them to an audible frequency.<P>

<CENTER>ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL CAPS</CENTER>


When a landfill can't take any more trash, it has to be covered so that water 
doesn't seep in and carry contaminants into the soil or groundwater below.  
Researchers are now looking for alternatives to traditional landfill caps. I'm Jim 
Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


<B>ambience</B> bulldozers on landfill <P>

At Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, scientists are testing traditional 
and alternative landfill caps side-by-side.<P>


"The test plots are 40 feet wide by 300 foot long. The eastern half of each test 
plot will have a sprinkler system installed in it. We can simulate a 100-year 
rainfall event, snow melt in the spring time, whatever."<P>


Steve Dwyer is the principal investigator for the landfill cover demonstration 
project. Most of the alternative caps are designed to perform as well as or better 
than traditional covers even though they're cheaper and easier to build.  Dwyer 
says they could even help protect the environment from landfills that weren't 
properly designed to begin with.<P>


"A lot of the problems are with existing landfills. They don't have the liners below 
them so basically all they're doing is being installed in a hole in the ground. And if 
that's near a groundwater supply, the leachate coming from the landfill will 
eventually get into that water, and could cause some serious problems. There are 
recorded cases of flora and fauna kills, there's been communities that have had to 
switch drinking water supplies, and if you use a better cover, you can help 
alleviate some of those mistakes of the past, and for future covers you can make 
them all that much better."<P>

"Water is becoming scarcer and scarcer and we're wanting to protect our water 
supplies, and the more we can do that the better off we'll be." <P>

<CENTER>ALTERNATIVE LANDFILL CAPS - The right design for the climate</CENTER>


When a landfill is closed, it has to be covered to keep water out. But different 
climates may call for different kinds of cover. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the 
Pulse of the Planet. <P>


"We're going to have a variety of alternative landfill covers. They're going to be 
designed specifically for dry environments. They'll emphasize materials that are 
readily available to the area, such as basic soils found in the area, sands and 
gravels."<P>


Steve Dwyer is the principal investigator of the alternative landfill cover 
demonstration project at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. Researchers 
are constructing test plots in the dry climate to compare the performance of new 
designs with tradtional landfill caps.<P>


"We're going to install at least three different covers. We will be taking into 
consideration the environment in the dry areas. We're going to encourage 
evaporation by increasing the storage capabilites of the soil layers. We're going to 
discourage erosion by bettering the vegetative covers. We're going to allow the 
soil covers that are installed to work with the basic drier enviroment, and let the 
dry environment do the majority of the work."<P>


Most landfills are covered with a barrier layer of soil that is designed to keep 
water out. The soil is normally saturated, then molded and compacted into a 
uniform layer. But Dwyer says that in arid climates, problems can occur when the 
soil layer dries and loses water volume. <P>

 

"And it's going to shrink and crack.  And those cracks are going to leave avenues 
for water to get down through and into the waste, which really defeats the whole 
purpose. So when you put it in originally, yeah, you've got a really great cover. But 
as it dries, it's not so great a cover any more."<P>


Further testing should show if Sandia's alternative landfill caps will solve that 
problem. <P>

<CENTER>ARTIFICIAL MOUTH</CENTER>


There may be no accounting for taste, but scientists have found a way to measure 
flavor - or at least figure out what aromas help create the particular flavor of a 
particular food.  I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


(95.11.16) "We're actually calling this device a retronasal aroma simulator, or 
artificial mouth. Retronasal aroma is actually the aroma that occurs when people 
chew food in their mouth and air that's released from the food in the mouth goes 
up the back passage to the nose."<P>


Deborah Roberts developed the artificial mouth as a doctoral student in the 
Department of Food Science and Technology at Cornell University. It's a hi-tech 
blender designed to simulate the conditions in the human mouth while a person is 
chewing food. First the food items - grapes in this case - are put in the blender.<P>

<B>ambience</B> grapes being poured in, then liquid, then blender going on (95.11.16)<P>


"Then I'll add the artificial saliva then I'll turn on the air flow and start the 
blender."<P>

"The machine isn't actually tasting the food. It's just simulating the mouth 
conditions that affect flavor release. In the device, the flavor compounds are 
released and they're collected on a trap. We actually analyze the volatiles from 
this trap using a machine called a gas chromatograph, that separates the 
molecules. And then we use a human to sniff these molecules and tell us which of 
them has aroma and what the aroma is. And this way we're able to determine what 
the important aroma compounds are in various foods." <P>


By offering a new way to measure the smell component of food, the artificial 
mouth could help chemists determine, for example, what causes the flavor 
difference between high-fat and a low-fat food. <P>

<CENTER>ARTIFICIAL MOUTH - Fat-free flavor</CENTER>

Everyone knows that low-fat ice cream just doesn't taste quite the same as the 
high-fat, premium kind. Now a new device called an artificial mouth seeks to 
measure what it is about the aroma of a food like ice cream that contributes to its 
particular flavor. I'm Jim Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


"When someone eats food, there are taste sensations, such as sweet, sour, salty, 
bitter. But there's also something to flavor called aroma, and that's actually the 
smell component of flavor. The molecules that cause the smell component of 
flavor are those volatile molecules which are in the air above food. And these 
molecules have to proceed up the back passage to the nose." <P>

"A good example of the importance of the smell component to the whole flavor of a 
food, is if you pinch your nose when you're eating, this will actually give a large 
decrease in the perceived flavor." <P>


<B>ambience</B> blender<P>

Deborah Roberts developed the artificial mouth - also known as the retronasal 
aroma simulator - in the Department of Food Science and Technology at Cornell 
University.  It's a modified blender that simulates chewing, temperature, air flow 
and salivation - the conditions in the human mouth when a person is eating.<P>

The molecules that form the aroma are released, and then analyzed to determine 
which aroma compounds are important in different foods.<P>


"For instance, fat free foods often don't have the full aroma character and they 
don't have the same taste as the full fat foods. We're looking at skim milk versus 
whole milk. Everyone knows that it's better to drink milk with low fat, but still 
there's a preference for the higher fat milk. So we are analyzing these two 
products in the artificial mouth, to determine the differences and for us to better 
formulate low fat milk." <P>

<CENTER>ARTIFICIAL MOUTH - Formulating flavor</CENTER>


How can you measure something as subjective as the taste of food? Scientists 
think they've found a way. It's called an artificial mouth. It's an ordinary  blender 
modified to simulate the conditions in a person's mouth while eating. I'm Jim 
Metzner, and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


<B>ambience</B> blender <P> 

That's the sound of the artificial mouth, also known as the retronasal aroma 
simulator. Deborah Roberts developed it as a PhD candidate at the Department of 
Food Science and Technology at Cornell University. The device measures the aroma 
of food, an important component of taste, and offers food chemists a new tool to 
help formulate flavors.<P>


"One of the advantages of this device is that we can analyze any food. We've 
analyzed fresh raspberries, heated raspberries and heated raspberries with cream 
added, and we were able to determine the flavor compounds that caused 
differences between those three products. We've also analyzed other systems that 
show the effect of oil on flavor  release. This is a very important aspect of foods 
that affects their flavors, the oil content, and we've been able to show how oil 
influences the flavor." <P>


The device is sensitive enough to detect the aroma molecules at the trace levels 
found in food. Another application could be in agriculture.<P>


"As breeders try and determine which varieties they want to continue in their 
programs, they need a measure of the flavor of the food. This device can give that 
measure, and it can allow them to choose those varieties which will give in a very 
flavorful product in the end. For instance in the history of breeding apples, the 
sugar-acid ratio has been used for a very long time to select varieties for future 
breeding. But they haven't actually had a measure of flavor, and this is what this 
device could be used for." <P>

<CENTER>MAGNETIC FIELD RESEARCH - The Most Powerful Magnet</CENTER>


Scientists are building the most powerful magnet in the world. With it,

they hope to better understand the hidden properties of matter. I'm Jim

Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


<B>ambience</B> Liquifier  <P>

"What you're hearing in the background is the liquifier that is taking

liquid helimum at minus 459 degrees faranheit, over to a cooldown test of

what will be the world's largest research magnet. It'll produce a magnetic

field of a million times the earth's magnetic field." <P>


Dr. Jack Crow is director of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.

He says that there are many applications for magnets of this size.<P>


One is the use of magnetism to study new materials: new chemical 
structures, biological structures, As you turn up the magnetic field, it's like turning up the magnefier on a microscope. So as we go to higher and higher fields, we 
can see smaller and smaller objects.<P>

Magnetism is an important part of motors, and we can store energy in large 
magnet systems. There we can build them from small units to enormous units that 
are magnets the size of a football field, and stores 20 million Watts for an hour. 
And that would take care of the city of Tallahassee, for example, that has a total

generating capacity of 400 million Watts. That would supply the power if we

had an interruption, for a few minutes. And that would give stability to it

so we wouldn't have to come home and look at all our digital clocks

blinking at us." <P>


The high powered magnet is scheduled to be up and running by late 1996.<P>

<B>ambience</B>,  dawn chorus<P>

Biologists have found genetic evidence to support the idea that all living things 
are indeed connected.  It means that the future may hold in store a whole new 
generation of drugs and other products.  I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of 
the Planet. <P>


J.Craig Venter is director of the Institute for Genomic Research<P>


" I think people are constantly amazed that the human genes are virtually identical 
to the genes of other species. Even at the DNA sequence level genes from humans 
are virtually greater than 90 percent identical to those from rats and mice. We 
have to go down all the way  to bacteria and plants to find really significant 
differences in the gene structure. And when you look at the protein or the amino 
acid level, the similarity is much, much higher. So I think people will begin to see 
from  really seeing the fundamentals of biology that humans are more related 
perhaps to every other species, including pine trees and grass and fish, insects,  
than they ever imagined.  And that maybe will create a different view of humanity 
and even ecology.<P>

Given a common genetic heritage, plants and animals are now seen as potential 
sources for durgs and other useful products.<P>


"There are plants that produce taxol, which is potentially useful for treating 
breast cancer, and there's ways to genetically engineer plants and other organism 
to produce very large amounts of these compounds, which are very difficult to 
synthsize chemically. So in terms of humsn therapeutics, there's no question that 
plants and  other organisms are going to be used in ability to produce new 
pharmaceutical compounds, perhaps cheaper and faster than have been done in the 
past."<P>

even slightly, the computer can track the tumor and keep the beam focused on its 
target.<P>


 "And it basically is just a precision irradiation. And it is

intended for just about any type of brain cancer initially. It is

undergoing FDA trials to prove that it has value in treating brain tumors.

And we've already started to treat tumors outside the brain, having treated

a tumor of the spinal cord. Further in the future we plan

to treat tumors of the prostate, lung, liver, elsewhere in the body." <P>


Dr. John Adler is an associate professor of Neurosurgery at Stanford

University Medical Center. He says that, while successful treatment will

add healthier years to cancer patients lives, it shouldn't be seen as a cure for

the disease.<P>


 "There are limitations to it. It's not a cure for cancer. It can irradicate a tumor 
that a cancer may produce, but it can't eliminate the entire cancer from your 
system. And if for example, a malignant brain tumor of the brain can often send 
little fingers of tumor off into the normal brain. One can't erradicate every finger. 
One may be able to chop off the head of the octopus, but one can't get every little 
tenticle. But we've learned from experience that in many patients there is

value in chopping off the head of the octopus and one lives both better and

longer." <P>

<CENTER>FALL SAFE FLOORS - The Elderly</CENTER>


<B>music</B><P>

To the elderly, one hard fall can mean the difference between being sctive or 
bedridden. Now, scientists are developing a new type of floor that may help 
prevent such a debilitating accident. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the 
Planet. <P>


<B>ambience</B>, Walking - Stocking Feet on Floor<P>

That's the sound of someone walking across a safety floor.<P>


"It's been shown that people over 60, all people over 60 on average, fall at least 
once a year. Now, by the time you get to 80 years old, this increases exponentially. 
So if we can have an impact on reducing the number of injuries from falls, then I 
think that will not only benefit those who are being prevented from injury, but it 
will also bring down health care costs."<P>


Peter Cavanaugh, a distinguished professor of Locomotion Studies at Penn State 
University is helping to develop the Safety Floor. The floor boards are supported 
underneath by many vertical columns. Like plastic straws, they absorb sudden 
impacts by buckling under pressure - cushioning falls but supporting normal 
walking.<P>


 "Well, the goal of the floor is to install it in places where we can concentrate 
people who are at high risk for falls. We have been studying where people fall at a 
typical nursing home and we have found that most of the falls occur in the 
patient's own rooms So If we can put the flooring in the patients' rooms, then that 
is the area that it will do most good."<P>

"The great benefit of our floor is that it's something that doesn't need any 
compliance by the patient. They don't have to take a pill, they don't have to wear a 
pad. The floor is there if and when they fall." <P>

<CENTER>ULTRASONIC TOXIC WASTE DESTROYER - How it Works</CENTER><P>


<B>music</B><P>

<B>ambience</B>: Machinery - Ultrasonic Toxic Waste Destroyer<P>

Scientists are developing a machine that can destroy hazardous waste using high-
frequency sound waves. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


We're listening to an ultrasonic toxic waste destroyer. It's pumping contaminated water 
into a chamber that's bombarded with sound waves at frequencies around the upper 
threshold of human hearing.<P>


"These systems or reactors are called ultrasonic irradiation devices and they're 
designed to introduce ultrasound into water and thereby generate gas bubbles that 
collapse violently and generate combustion-like conditions that destroy chemical 
contaminants present in water." <P>


Dr. Michael Hoffman is a professor of Environmental Chemistry at the California 
Institute of Technology. He says the device generates a sound wave with a frequency of 
around15 kilohertz.<P>


"At this level, the sound waves force the formation of bubbles in water, similar to 
opening a carbonated beverage." <P>


The bubbles are allowed to develop to a point at which they become unstable. Then 
another ultrasonic wave is applied.<P>


"And then as a successive sonic wave, ultrasonic wave passes through the bubble, the 
bubble collapses and generates localized high temperatures and pressures. The pressures 
within a gas bubble while it collapses can be as high as 1,000 atmospheres and the 
temperatures as high as about 5,000 degrees Centigrade. For example, the temperature of 
the surface of the sun is about 6,000 degrees Centigrade, so we generate very extreme 
conditions, temperatures and pressures much higher than those encountered during high 
temperature incineration. And we harness these conditions to destroy chemical 
compounds." <P>

<B>music</B><P>

<B>ambience</B>:Machinery-Ultrasonic Toxic Waste Destroyer<P>


We're listening to a machine that could provide scientists with a clean and inexpensive 
way to destroy toxic chemicals in water. All it takes is some high-frequency sound. I'm 
Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


The Ultrasonic Toxic Waste Destroyer pumps contaminated water into a chamber where 
it's exposed to high frequency sound waves . The sound energy  causes bubbles to form in 
the water which grow and become unstable and eventually collapse. This produces  
extremely high temperatures and pressures which destroy a wide range of chemical 
compounds in the water .<P>


"Most of the chemical compounds are used in manufacturing. For instance, a major 
chemical contaminant that we can readily destroy is perchloroethylene, which is 
conventional dry-cleaning fluid."<P>


Dr. Michael Hoffman is a professor of Environmental Chemistry at the California 
Institute of Technology. He says by varying the frequencies, the machine can destroy 
many different contaminants.<P>


"In ultrasound, we can harness frequencies over the range of about 16 kilohertz up to 1 
megahertz in frequency and different chemical compounds are destroyed more readily at 
one frequency versus another frequency. So by appropriately applying a particular 
frequency range, we can destroy a very broad range of chemical compounds."<P>


The cost of the components is quite small compared to some other technologies, such as 
high-temperature incineration where the facility may run into the tens of millinos of 
dollars to construct. Ultrasound is quite inexpensive, devices are commonly available and 
capital cost range in the tens of thousands of dollars as opposed to millions of dollars."<P>

<CENTER>MONEY RECYCLING</CENTER>


<B>music</B><P>

Ever wonder what happens to paper money when it wears out? Well, like many 
other materials it can end up in a landfill, unless it's recycled. I'm Jim Metzner 
and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


<B>ambience</B>, Machine, Shredder <P>

We're listening to the sound of a machine that's shredding old paper currency.<P>


"This machine will count, verify, as well as destroy the money if need be. What 
happens is the money is placed with the straps on it in the front of the machine, it 
goes through a process where it's verified, and if it needs to be destroyed, it is 
cut into confetti like pieces and shoots up the tube in the back that's green where 
you can actually see it shooting through. It goes into another room in which case 
liquid is added to the material and then formed into a charcoal-like briquette." <P>


Abby Wong is with the Federal Reserve Bank in Los Angeles. They've been working 
with a wide range of companies who see the strong fibers of U.S. paper money as a 
valuable raw material.<P>


"Venders who have been interested in our shredded currency have ranged from 
freeway paneling to roof tiles to fire logs. Currently we are in an effort with a 
vendor where they take our shredded currency briquettes and mix it with a 
concrete slurry. And what the product is is a wood shingle-like roof tile. Other 
vendors that we've worked with for the recycled products would be fire logs. This 
company mixes landfill material, just as ours. And it's a combustible material, 
which works well for environmentally-safe fire logs. Other options have been, 
which interior designers actually like, are insulation panels for buildings because 
the green tint to the money makes a very attractive color in the paneling." <P>

<CENTER>MONEY RECYCLING - Green Products</CENTER>


<B>music</B><P>

Disposing of money that's been worn out or otherwise rendered unusable can cost a 
lot of money in and of itself. But now the federal government is finding some 
creative ways of putting unfit currency back into circulation. I'm Jim Metzner and 
this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>


<B>ambience</B>, Machinery, Money Recycling Facility <P>


We're at a recycling facility where paper money is being shreadded and, with the 
help of hig-pressure machinery, converted into briquettes.<P>


"The amount of money that is shredded in the Los Angeles branch is approximately 
15 tons per week. That's about a quarter of a million dollars per week. We are one 
of the biggest processers of cash in the United States." <P>


Abby Wong is with the Federal Reserve Bank in Los Angeles.<P>

"Here in Los Angeles branch, it costs us about 100,000 a year to place the 
currency in a landfill. We can save, in operating costs, this 100,000 dollars if we 
actually send it to vendors so that they can recycle this money into usable building 
products someplace else." <P>


The briquettes of shredded money are sent out to a wide range of companies who 
convert the currency into usable products.<P>


"Where you might see the products of shredded currency today, could be in novelty 
items, if you see then inside pens, you might see them inside a little bag sold 
somewhere. We've also seen them inside teddy bears. Typically you're going to see 
them on roofs - wood shingles on roofs, freeway panels will have a little green 
tint, sound panels will also have that green tint. You might see them in a fire log 
in a fireplace... We hope that our recycling efforts will certainly environmentally 
reduce landfills, reduce our operating costs, as well as place products back out on 
the market. That could be fire logs, could be freeway insulation, it could be the 
roof tiles. The money that you've used in your daily lives will get back to you in 
the products that you buy every day on the market." <P>

<CENTER>SELF-HEATING MEALS</CENTER><P>


<B>music</B><P>

Convenience foods just got a bit more convenient. There's now a new type of

TV dinner that not only cooks in 14 minutes, it doesn't even need an oven.

I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


"So when one opens the box at one end of the carton and slides out the contents, 
they'll see a white foam tray that's holding the heater. That is beneath the food 
entree and there's two other packages in there. One is the utensils and knife and 
pepper fork and salt. And the other's a bag of plain old tap water. And, when one 
rips the water bag open and pours it on the heater, those two ounces meet up with 
the salt that is already in the heater, and that is going to create a liquid that is 
going to corrode the magnesium and iron." <P>


<B>ambience</B>, Sizzling, TV Dinner  <P>

Drew McLandrich is with Zesto Therm, manufacturers of this self-heating meal. He 
says that when the salt water comes into contact with the heater, which is a 
small porous bag of magnesium and iron, it can raise the temperature of the food 
in the container by 100 degrees Faranheit.<P>


"What's going on inside the box right now is the heater is running its course. And 
what's happened is the salt water has found the granuals of magnesium that have 
very fine bits of iron attached to them. So the salt water is fizzing off the little 
granules of iron from the little granules of magnesium, and the heat that's being 
created is being transfered through the thin film of the food tub, into the food 
itself and heating the food."<P>


Mr. McLandrich also says that the magnesium and iron used to heat the food

are safe materials found in our everyday diet.<P>


The food is in a sealed tub with a film membrane atop the tub which is pressed up 
against the heater. And that keeps any of the two things from mixing. But if that 
were to occur, it would not be detrimental." <P>

<CENTER>SELF-HEATING MEALS - More Than Just a TV Dinner</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><P>

Who ever thought corrosion could be useful? One company is using the

properties of salt water corrosion to cook TV dinners. I'm Jim

Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


<B>ambience</B>, Sizzling, TV Dinner <P>

We're listening to the sounds of a Heater Meal - a packaged food product

that's cooked by pouring salt water onto a porous pouch of a

magnesium and iron alloy. The salt water rigorously corrodes the metals,

raising the temperature of the adjacent food package by 100 degrees

Faranheit. <P>


 "The idea for self heating metallic alloy powders is one that's been around since 
the 1930s. But there have been really no significant uses of the product until the 
Desert Storm conflict that led to the military taking this heating technology and 
adopting it for field use for soldiers to heat a meal ready

to eat." <P>

 Drew McLandrich is with Zesto Therm, manufacturers of the self-heating meal.<P>


"We've made about 65 million heaters for the military in the last half dozen years. 
The Heater Meals product is used by most everybody. Long distance truck drivers 
have been our first and most successful market. And the product's in around 800 
truck stops in 48 states. Additional users would surely be hunters, campers, 
fishermen, boaters, anybody that would like a hot meal anytime anyplace. That 
would include football fans at halftime of a football game, picnickers, people at a 
music concert. So it has a great variety of uses." <P>


And the self-heating technology could be used for more than solid food.<P>

"A beverage for sure could be heated. And we do have prototypes of a

baby bottle warmer, and we're also working on making a portable hot cup of

coffee or a hot cup of tea or cocoa. And we have a product that we may be bringing 
out in the next year or so that a homeowner could use to thaw a frozen pipe, even 
one that the homeowner couldn't actively reach that was frozen back in a wall."<P>

<CENTER>BRAIN CANCER TREATMENT</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><P>

Neurosurgeons have a new tool that may allow them to treat brain cancer on

an out-patient basis. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


<B>ambience</B>, Robotic Arm  <P>

That's the sound of a robotic arm that's positioning a

high-powered x-ray. It's part of a new device that destroys brain tumors

with an intense beam of radiation. This type of technology has been

available for some time, but conventional methods require the patient's

head to be surgically attached to a frame in order to keep it still.<P>


The difficulty with this approach is it does in fact involve

putting screws in the patient's head and is painful. In addition, the

technoloy is sufficiently painful that we can only treat the patient one

time. And with very big tumors, a one-time treatment risks injuring the

brain immediately surrounding the tumor." <P>


Dr. John Adler is an associate professor of Neurosurgery at Stanford

University Medical Center.  Using technology originally designed for use in cruise

missles, he's developing a new form of treatment that tracks the subtle 
movements of a person's head, avoiding the use of the frame and the screws. And 
since there are no wounds to heal, the patient may receive several treatments of 
low level radiation as opposed to one large dose.<P>


 "Conventional radiation therapy works by using a much broader beam of

radiation and treating both healthy tissue and malignant tissue.

Conventional radiation relies on the fact that the malignant tissue doesn't

recover from a dose of radiation as well as the healthy tissue. And by

dividing a dose of radiation into several smaller doses, one allows the

healthy tissue to recover, but the malignant tissue doesn't bounce back. I think it 
leads, not only to a better outcome in many of these patients, but also a

far easier way for them to have the operation. <P>

<CENTER>BRAIN CANCER TREATMENT - Wielding the Cyber Knife</CENTER><P>


<B>music</B><P>

Using technology originally designed for cruise missles, neurosurgeons

can track and destroy brain tumors without breaking the skin. I'm Jim

Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>


<B>ambience</B>, Operating Table <P>

We're listening to the sound of an operating table that's positioning a patient 
underneath a device called the cyber knife. It's a type of x-ray machine that 
surgeons may soon use to treat tumors.<P>


"This is the cyber knife. It consists of a robot which has six different joints that 
can move the radiation source with great flexibility. The radiation source is 
something called a linear accelerator, a device that makes x-rays." <P>


Dr. John Adler is an associate professor of Neurosurgery at Stanford

University Medical Center. He says the precision of the new technology

allows surgeons to point several beams of radiation at a tumor. Surgeons

scan the tumorous portion of the brain and program it into the device. If

the patient moves even slightly, the robot reads its computer-stored map and

keeps the beams focused on the tumor.<P>


"The patient's head is restrained so that their head moves within plus

or minus five millimeters, which almost any cooperative adult can do. And

while the patient's lying there making small little movements, these

movements are registered by the imaging system. And, using what's really

analogous to cruise missle technology, the patient's head is tracked as it

makes small movements. And this tracking capability allows one to keep the

beam, this very intense beam of radiation, focused on the tumor at all

times. And because one knows exactly where the tumor is, one can also shoot at 
the tumor from many different directions. By shooting at it from

many different directions, one concentrates the radiation where all these beams

intersect and we make that point of intersection the same as the tumor."

And the reason is that the spider silk has properties that no synthetic material can capture. It gives a little bit and then it stiffens as you stretch it. You can think about, have you ever seen a spider doing a bungee jump? No. The spider drops nice and smoothly, whereas, if it were a conventional elastomer, the spider would bungee up and down and that doesn't happen."<P>

Although it seems the spiders don't mind being "silked," the process is rather time consuming. Jelinski is exploring the idea of mass producing the spider silk chemicals by growing them in genetically engineered plants or other organisms.<P>

24:00) "The advantage of producing it in some other organism is that you don't have to deal with the spiders. It's very time consuming to take these spiders down and pull the silk out at the right rate. We would be much better if we could plant an entire field of tobacco, let's say, and have that be busy making acres and acres of high performance material. And that's really our dream."<P>

<CENTER>SPIDER SILK - Uses</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
Nature is providing scientists with a blueprint for creating high-performance materials. Take, for example, the amazing properties of spider silk... I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet. <P>

<B>ambience,</B> Erector Set Helicopter, Spider Silk Extractor (95.7.21 34:00)
We're listening to the sounds of a machine that's slowly extracting a strand of silk from a spider.<P>

DAT 95.7.21 4:00) "We're entering an exciting new time in material science. There is an emerging new field called biomolecular materials and what that is is gleaning from nature ideas to make new polymers and that's what we're doing with the spider silk."<P>

Lynn Jelinsky (gel-IN-skee) is director of Cornell University's Center for Advanced Technology. She's studying the golden orb-weaving spider, whose silk is as strong as steel, yet flexible enough to be stretched to ten times its original length.<P>

17:00) "The uses for spider silk are really only limited by your imagination. You can immediately think of big quantity uses - for example, seat belts where you'd like it to give just a little bit and then you'd like it to stiffen before your head went through that windshield. Also, parachutes are another opportunity, but we shouldn't overlook the possible applications in biomedical devices. there are biodegradable polymers. They could be used for ultrafine sutures, for example, in surgery."<P>

25:00) "It may turn out that this is just not an economically viable way to go. However, I think in the long run, this field of biomolecular materials is givigng us insight that we never had before, and out of it will come new materials, whether they're spider made, plant made or man made is hard to tell, but certainly by looking at the spider, it's giving us new insight into how to make synthetic polymers."<P>

<CENTER>ANIMAL WASTE PRODUCTS</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
A poultry farm with 100,000 chickens can produce ten tons of manure every day. Now, scientists are developing a machine which can convert that waste into natural gas and other useful products. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience,</B> Shaker (95.7.20A 105M)<BR>
We're in a laboratory listening to the sounds of an incubator. It's growing a special type of bacteria that will be used in the thermophilic anaerobic digester (THER-mo-fill-ick  ANN-air-oh-bick..).<P>

140) "In the absense of air, there's a group of bacteria that can break down organic matter, in this case the manure, and convert it into very small molecules, which is methane and carbon dioxide. And methane is natural gas. So we thought that may be a way to manage the waste and at the same time produce something valuable."<P>

Dr. Jason Shih (SHEE) is a professor at North Carolina State University's Department of Poultry Science. He says the machine works by heating the waste to around 115 degrees Faranheit. Special bacteria then convert the waste into three phases.<P>

192) "One is a gas phase, which is a biogas or methane gas, which you can use as a fuel. Liquid phase is the waste water coming out of the digester. The waste water has a high nutrient content. We studied that and found that it can be utilized as a source of nutrient to support fish growth. Then the third phase is sludge, which sounds dirty stuff, but we can convert it into what we call a solid byproduct. And of course there's some protein in it and some vitamin in it. They all can be a good nutrient source for growing chicken or any other animals."<P>

Dr. Shih says that, in theory, a farm with 50,000 chickens could supply enough fuel to provide electricity for about 200 homes. <P>

<CENTER>SOLAR CHIPS</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
A new invention is giving the cause of solar power an encouraging shot in the arm. Using silicon and a special type of cement, buildings, railroad ties, and shingles can now be turned into solar energy collectors. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience,</B> Sieve Shaker (95.8.24A 7M - cut #1, mono)<BR>
We're listening to the sounds of a sieve that's sifting out uniform pieces of silicon, the same material that's used in computer chips. They're going to be mixed with an extra strong cement that's molded onto a sheet, forming the basic structure of what's called a "solar chip."<P>

339) "The solar chips work by absorbing the sunlight and producing a current that flows on the two outer surfaces of the sheet."<P>

Dr. James Van Vechten (VECK-ten) is a professor of electric and computer engineering at Oregon State University. He says that by connecting the chips, the system can produce a hundred Watts of energy per square meter. But perhaps the most attractive feature of the material is its durability.<P>

403) "Our solar cells differ from the conventional ones in that they're made of very robust material. They do not need to be put in a package and guarded outdoors. They're not susceptible to being stolen, and they are quite a little bit cheaper than existing solar cells. Existing solar cells, commercially, are selling for about six dollars per Watt. And we hope to be able to offer ours, in maybe three years time, at twenty cents a peak Watt, and in a form where they can be simply applied to the sides of buildings, railroad ties, and roofing shingles without a package over them and with no protection."<P>

We'll hear more about Solar Chips in future programs.<BR>

<CENTER>SOLAR CHIPS - Applications</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
In the future, buildings, railroad ties and virtually any other structure that's exposed to light may be used as a solar collector. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience,</B> Mortar and Pestle (95.8.24A 109M - cut #2, mono)<BR>
We're listening to the sounds of a mortar and pestle grinding chunks of silicon into small grains. This powder will be added to a cement mixture and formed into a flat sheet that'll conduct electricity like a solar panel.<P>

348) "Solar panels now are mostly used to power satellites in space where there is no power grid to hook onto. Our purpose is to make something that can supply the general energy needs of the world population here on earth."<P>

Dr. James Van Vechten (VECK-ten) is a professor of electric and computer engineering at Oregon State University. He says one of the first applications of the material will be attaching them to roofing shingles.<P>

367) "Normally the roofing shingles are outdoors and when the sun is up, it shines on them. These would be connected together in series as the shingles are normally laid on the roof, so that they would produce tens of amps of current at fifty volts, which is the legal maximum for a unprotected voltage outdoors."<P>

Dr. Van Vechten imagines these solar collectors could be attached to everything from railroad ties to office buildings. And they might even make their way indoors.<P>

460) "There's a considerable waste of energy in taking the 120 volts AC that comes out of the wall and converting it down to three volt DC, which is what a modern computer or many other modern electronic devices run on. With the solar cells, they naturally produce DC at low voltages. It would be quite easy, for example, to have the solar cells on the case in normal room lighting, convert the room lighting into the power supply for the computer itself."<P>

Scientists are now using waste silicon from the computer industry as the main ingredient for a new type of solar energy collector. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience,</B> Hammer - Breaking Silicon (95.8.24A 134M)<BR>
273) "This is the research process in which we take waste silicon ingot sections and start to break them up into the small grains we need for the solar cells."<P>

Dr. James Van Vechten (VECK-ten) is a professor of electric and computer engineering at Oregon State University. He's developing thin solar panels made with a mixture of silicon grains and a high-strength cement. The new panels use forty percent less silicon than conventional solar cells.<P>

417) "This is because the normal process first makes the electronic grade polycrystaline silicon into wafers, which involves a waste of about 78 percent of all the silicon they begin with. And it's that 78 percent that initially we would take and use for our process. Also the conventional cells are about eleven times thicker than they need to be, from an electrical point of view. Less than ten percent of the silicon in the conventional cells is actually involved in making the energy. The rest is just there for mechanical support. We use our very strong cement and a concrete substrate they're put on for the mechanical support."<P>

Dr. Van Vechten says that these solar cells can be attached to just about any cement structure, such as railroad ties and buildings. They may also help industry to reuse the roughly ten million metric tons of silicon thrown away every year.<P>

575) "If our project is successful we will be able to turn that into an energy source equivalent to eight standard nuclear reactor stations per year. But also we'll be saving the landfills for materials that actually need to be in there."<P>

<CENTER>ANIMAL WASTE PRODUCTS - Chicken Feed</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
<B>ambience,</B> Chickens, Muscoot Farm (91.9.2-1 87N)<BR>
For over 15 years, scientists have been researching ways to manage the vast amount of feathers and other waste produced as a biproduct of chicken farming.  What's all this work amounted to?... Well, for one thing, Chicken feed.  I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Jason Shih (SHEE) is a professor at North Carolina State University's Department of Poultry Science. He's been developing a machine that uses bacteria to break down animal waste into carbon dioxide and methane - or natural gas. One day, a dead chicken accidentally ended up in the digester, and that lead to a curious discovery.<P>

250) "And then we opened up the digester after a few days - the chicken also disappeared. And we'd like to find out why."<P>

It turns out that a particular strain of bacteria used in Dr. Shih's system was hearty enough to break down even the toughest of proteins.<P>

"Chicken feather, which is made of protein called 'keratin,' a very tough protein, it's not digestible by our intestinal tract. Apparantly, the digester that we were operating seems to be able to digest the feathers. So we spent two or three years, and we finally found the bacteria."<P>

The bacteria produce an enzyme that can convert keratin and other tough proteins into amino acids. The resulting product can be used as a low-cost, nutritional protein source for chicken and other livestock feed. Now that's more than chicken feed when you think of how many chicken feathers are out there.<P>

352) "In the United States, we produce about one million tons of chicken feathers every year. If we can convert that chicken feather to make it become a digestible protein, we think we can generating about 400 million US dollars a year for the market, based on the protein value."<P>

ambience, Shaker, Laboratory (95.8.20A 15o - STEREO)
We're listening to the sounds of a laboratory shaker. It's being used to analyze blood samples taken from baboons who've been vaccinated against sperm. Dr. Erwin Goldberg, professor of Biochemistry at Northwestern University, is developing the contraceptive vaccine. Its active ingredient is a unique protein found only in sperm. Injecting it directly into the female's bloodstream causes an immune response.<P>

103) "This stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against a foreign substance. Sperm contain components that are not present in the female. These are recognized as foreign very much the same way that bacteria are recognized as foreign, and an immune response to this foreign material is mounted, and will then have the protective effect."<P>

179) "We're testing this vaccine in a group of female baboons. These animals now are being mated, and we're determining over a period of several menstrual cycles of the baboons, how long they're protected against pregnancy. So far, in our first study we achieved an efficacy level of between 75 and 80 percent protection against pregnancy in the female baboons."<P>

They're also testing the vaccine to see how long its effects last.
164) "In the case of the birth control vaccine that we're working on, we have done studies to demonstrate that it is reversible, that the effect wears off after approximately eight to twelve months."<P>

<CENTER>CONTRACEPTIVE VACCINE - A More Natural Process</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
Scientists are developing a new form of contraception that doesn't use hormones, has no known side effects, and is administered once every eight to twelve months. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

238) "A number of years ago, we discovered a unique protein that was associated with the sperm cell. Since it was a unique protein, we knew that it would stimulate an immune response. And we knew furthermore that naturally-occuring infertility due to an immune response, caused problems in couples who wanted to bear children. So, drawing upon that experiment of nature, we thought that perhaps we could develop our finding into a practical contraceptive approach that would be different and useful."<P>

Dr. Erwin Goldberg, professor of Biochemistry at Northwestern University, is developing a vaccine against pregnancy. He says that injecting the unique sperm protein into a female's bloodstream, causes her immune system to produce antibodies to fight off the foreign invader. If she's exposed to sperm later on, these antibodies attack and kill them before they can reach the egg.<P>

154) "We would anticipate no safety problems because the vaccine is developed as a normal process in the body against a foreign substance. This happens all the time and does not create any health problems. And, in fact, there are examples of not only women, but men also who have antibodies in their body. They're infertile as a consequence of these antibodies against sperm, and yet they're perfectly healthy in all other respects."<P>

Dr. Goldberg also says the contraceptive wears off after about eight months.

Scientists from all over the world are currently mapping the human genome - the collection of 60,000 or so genes packaged in the units that we call chromosomes.  Their efforts are already having a profound effect on how we diagnose disease.  I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

We're listening to the sounds of a pipetting machine - used to prepare samples in human genome research.  With us is J. Craig Venter, director of the Institute for Genomic Research.<P>

DAT 95.5.1 7:25)  "There's about 5,000 genetic diseases that are due to defects in single genes. And so we're leading an effort right now to take the genes that we've discovered, to get them placed back on the physical maps of the chromosomes so that we can very rapidly get a list of all the genes there to find which is the gene that causes that disease. We were involved in a collaboration with Burt Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University where we discovered three new genes that are involved in the cause of colon cancer. And so from a period of time of discovering those genes in our database to the actual publication showing that these were the cause of this kind of colon cancer was about three months time. That's in contrast to the previous studies. For example, it took a decade and well over $100 million to find the gene in the tip of chromosome four which is actually responsible for Huntington's Disease. So by having all this information in a much shorter period of time, and being able to localize it back to the chromosomes, it's going to speed up our discovery of the cause of thousands of genetic diseases. And that's going to lead to early diagnostics, which with things like cancer, could be very valuable because if you can detect it early, there are treatments such as surgery to deal with it."<P>

<CENTER>HUMAN GENOME PROJECT - Knowing the Future of Disease</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
As scientists learn more about the causes of heredity illnesses, they're able to better predict at an early age individuals who will be at risk later in life.  This glimpse into the future may well advance the cause of medicne, but how will it effect the lives of those diagnosed?  I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

J. Craig Venter is director of the Institute for Genomic Research.<P>

(DAT 95.5.1  p4/5)  "Right now what we can do with Huntington's Disease and other genetic diseases is we can diagnose those at the earliest possible stage of human life and predict that that individual will come down with Huntington's Disease somewhere in their third or fourth decade of life. But we can't do anything about it right now. We can predict the future, but we can't alter the future. That's why it's critical that there is public education - that people understand these discoveries, understand the implications for their own lives. We have a problem with people who are afraid to have the test for Huntington's Disease or some of these other diseases because if they have them and it's a positive test, they could lose their life insurance or their health insurance. They could even lose their employment because with the insurance industry, they view it as they're no longer part of the shared risk, they're a known entity that they're going to come down with this disease. So we're going to have an increasing situation, unless we can get some laws changed, of genetic discrimination. People, because they know what's going to happen sometime, maybe forty years in the future, they're going to be discriminated against now. So I think there's a lot of serious implication with any new information, there's good and there's bad news. But as any information moves forward, it's going to have a tremendous positive impact on society and health care."<P>

<CENTER>TEXTILE RESEARCH - Pyro-Man</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
A fire fighter's nightmare is walking into a building where the temperature is so hot that an entire room can burst into flame.  I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

In order to develop new clothing that can withstand that kind of heat, scientists have enlisted the help of new sort of mannequin - Pyro-Man.<P>

<B>ambience,</B> Fire Burst (95.8.22A 406M) - mono<BR>
That's the sound of a burst of flame engulfing Pyro-Man.<P>

323) "What we have is a system that allows us to surround the mannequin with a cylinder of flames that would simulate this condition that a fire fighter might face."<P>

Dr. Roger Barker is a professor of textile materials science at North Carolina State University.<P>

377) "Typically, we would expose Pyro-Man to a flashover condition. That's an emergency condition that would be faced perhaps by a fire fighter who would walk into a room where the surfaces in that room and the gases in that room would have reached a condition where they would be spontaneously engulfing the room in flames. So it's a fairly high thermal exposure."<P>

470) "In the case of Pyro-Man, what we have are heat flux sensors which measure the thermal energy on the surface of Pyro-Man. And we have 122 of those distributed over the surface of the mannequin. And they take the reading of thermal energy or intesity of the thermal energy. And that output is analyzed and, we're able to predict a level of protection that would be provided by a test garment in terms of the degree of second degree burn, third degree burn, total body burn, and also where on the torso that burn is going to occur. And you can see how valuable that would be to us in terms of designing the protective garment or the protective material."<P>

<CENTER>TEXTILE RESEARCH- Fireproof Clothing</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
<B>ambience,</B> Fire Engines (SF 43A 660/B 258-279)<BR>
The latest fashion in fire fighting these days is a uniform that can withstand extreme bursts of flame, simultaneously, it lets the body cool itself off by releasing heat through the garment. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Roger Barker is director of the Thermal Protection Laboratory at North Carolina State University's College of Textiles. Their research is helping manufacturers develop better fire protective clothing.<P>

133) "Our role is to understand how the fiber may be spun into yarn and may be woven into fabric to increase its performance - the ability of the fabric to insulate against a high thermal exposure. At the same time, can we design a material so it is also able to allow moisture vapor to pass through it, because that's a big part of the way the body cools itself off - through the evaporation of sweat."<P>

This kind of research has helped develop many protective garments, such as a fire fighter's coat.<P>

206) "The coat typically consists of three layers of fabrics: The outer shell fabric that provides a level of fire resistance. Right immediately under that there's a layer called a moisture barrier. That's there to keep water from coming in and getting the fire fighter wet. And then there's a third layer that's called a thermal liner. And generally that's there to add another level of thermal insulation. And so all these three fabric systems have to function together. And some of the choices that have to made are very technical about how to make these choices and the synergy that can exist between these three different fabric materials."<P>

<CENTER>TEXTILE RESEARCH - Coppelius</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
Textile scientists now have a new tool for designing more comfortable clothing - a mannequin that sweats. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

Dr. Roger Barker is a professor of textile materials science at North Carolina State University. He's introducing us to Coppelius (koh-PEEL-ee-us).<P>

"He is a mannequin that actually sweats by virtue of the fact that we deliver moisture to simulated sweat glands distributed over his body. There's 187 of these tubes that are connected to sweat pores, but the difference between Coppelius, our sweating robot, and a human being is that we can control the rate of sweating and we can always have the same rate of sweating - we can do this reproducibly. So we can dress Coppelius out in a test garment and measure the heat loss, come up with an engineering measurement of that. He is suspended on a very sensitive balance, so all the while we can measure the change in the weight of the mannequin and that's an indication of how much moisture is being held and trapped inside the clothing."<P>

Coppelius is being used to measure how body heat dissipates through fabrics in climate conditions as diverse as a frozen tundra or a steamy rainforest.<P>

429) "Coppelius's skin is really a membrane that takes the moisture that comes to the pore and spreads it out, just like it would if you were sweating and your skin was getting increasingly wetter and wetter. So he's going to be very useful to us in studying clothing comfort for all sorts of things from skiwear to protective clothing. Chemical protective suits, for example, is one area where we're very interested in the heat burden that would be imposed, and Coppelius is going to help us study that."<P>

<CENTER>MAGNETIC FIELD RESEARCH</CENTER><P>

<B>music</B><BR>
For most people, magnets are what they use to hang things on the refrigerator door with. But to many scientists, they're useful tools for developing new materials and processes. I'm Jim Metzner and this is the Pulse of the Planet.<P>

<B>ambience,</B> Cooling Pipes (95.9.3A 72M)<BR>
We're standing near the cooling system for a high powered magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. Dr. Jack Crow is the Lab's director.<P>

60) "What we're listening to here is the water rushing through. This is extremely pure water, rushing through to cool the very large magnets."<P>

Dr. Crow says that high powered magnets like these have already been used for many applications - for example, the Magnetic Resonance Imagers available at many hospitals. They work by exposing the human body to a magnetic field, causing the nuclei of individual atoms to rotate.<P>

334) "And then from that, if we shine a signal in, a radio frequency signal, it disturbs that frequency of rotation and then it send a signal back because of that, which we convert into an image inside your body totally non-invasively. And we can do that in other materials also."<P>

High powered magnets are being used to manipulate atoms in the manufacture of new materials.<P>

360) "We have some experiments running on right now looking at the processing of new materials in magnetic fields. And that's processing polymers or plastics. And that's using the magnetic field to line up the little molecules in plastics and we make the plastics much stronger. That means we can make the plastic bottle thinner. We can make it so it degrades faster in a trash dump."<P>

Techniques like this can also be used to develop more efficient semiconductor chips which would, in turn, bring us faster computers.<P>

<title>ISDN Connectivity in Toronto (Ontario/Canada)</title>
<base href="http://www.dessus.com/isdn/index.html">
</head>

<body background=/icons/backgr/paper10.gif text=0x000000>
<center><h1>ISDN Connectivity in Toronto (Ontario/Canada)</h1></center>
<p>

<p>
Ordering an ISDN line in Toronto (sold under the trade name of MicroLink
for standard BRI (2B+D) access) was relatively straight forward.
Installation was quick and easy, and the installer great.  Total time
from ordering to completed installation:  one week!  The default
configuration which Bell puts on the line works flawlessly and is in
fact the provisioning setup required by many simpler TA's.  You only
need to specify how to provision the line if you want features such as
ETKS or CACH enabled (but you will need to speak to an Engineer to get
advanced ISDN features).  The default provisioning is voice+data on any
channel, DMS100 Custom PVC-1 with NI-1 compatibility.
</p>

<p>
Residential Rate ISDN is now available in Ontario and Quebec (Bell
Territories) and is somewhat cheaper than Business class Microlink
service.  However, the residential service also has usage charges of
$1.00 per Bearer Channel per hour for usage during the hours from 7a-7p
Business days (M-F excl Holidays). There is a maximum usage charge cap,
however, which brings the total cost of the Residential service to max
at just a few dollars more than the business service.  The residential
service, however, is Centrex facility blocked, meaning that you cannot
get Centrex services.
</p>

<h2>Detailed Charges for Toronto (Rate Group 15)</h2>


<h3>MicroLink (Business Class) Service</h3>

<center><table border=3 width=80%>
<tr><td>Installation and Configuration, per 2B+D BRI</td><td align=right>209.00</td><td>Service Charge</td></tr>
<tr><td>Switch Termination, per 2B+D</td><td align=right>78.00</td><td>Monthly Charge</td></tr>
<tr><td>911 Location Service, per B</td><td align=right>0.32</td><td>Monthly Charge</td></tr>
<tr><td>PSTN Interconnection, each of first 5</td><td align=right>13.15</td><td>Monthly Charge</td></tr>
<tr><td>PSTN Interconnection, each of next 6</td><td align=right>37.45</td><td>Monthly Charge</td></tr>
<tr><td>PSTN Interconnection, remainder</td><td align=right>46.95</td><td>Monthly Charge</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
The calculation rules and conditions are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Switch Termination is per BRI (2B+D) interface.
 <li>PSTN interconnection counts are determined by customer location
     and telephone company switch.  That is, the count is distinct for
     each combination of switch and location.
 <li>911 Location service is required on every Bearer channel, even if
     it cannot be used for Voice Bearer calls (CRTC Regulation)
 <li>Each combination of Switch and Location must purchase a minimum
     of one (1) PSTN interconnection.
 <li>The default installation configuration for BRI is 2B+D, single
     interface, and one PSTN interconnection.  Additional BRI interfaces
     to the same location from the same switch do not require PSTN and
     will not be configured for PSTN unless requested.
 <li>DSN does not presently have interconnect charges.
 <li>Features such as Equivalency are free, but must be ordered at the
     time the service is installed.  Configuration change orders carry
     a $60.00 service charge.
</ol>

<h3>MicroLink (Residential Class) Service</h3>

<center><table border=3 width=80%>
<tr><td>Installation and Configuration, per 2B+D BRI</td><td align=right>109.00</td><td>Service Charge*</td></tr>
<tr><td>Switch Termination, per 2B+D</td><td align=right>55.00</td><td>Monthly Charge</td></tr>
<tr><td>Usage / Channel / Hours**</td><td align=right>1.00</td><td><Monthly Charge</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
The calculation rules and conditions are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>One PSTN interconnection is included in the basic rate.  No tarrif
     is available for additional PSTNs.  Centrex services are NOT
     available for residential service.
 <li>*The installation fee is waived during the month of February
 <li>**Usage charges apply per B channel at $1.00 hour from 7a-7p
       business days.  These charges will not go into effect until
       March 1/95.

<H1>Welcome to the DB2 WWW Connection URL Search Demo</H1>
<P>
This demonstration shows how to use DB2 WWW Connection to manage
a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) database.
You can add (insert), update, delete, and query URLs in a local
database.
If you query a set of URLs, each queried
URL will be an active link.  That is, you will be able to jump to
the page specified by the URL by selecting it.

<H2><A NAME="HDRNEW41" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_3">What's new in Version 4.1</A></H2>
<P>
Enhancements for this version include:
<DL>
<P><DT><B>Improved logging and reporting
</B><DD>You can control the access requests that your server logs.  You can
also create and view reports based on the information in your access
logs.  You can customize your reports or use any of the report
templates that are provided.
<P><DT><B>Support for user-written programs that interface with your server
</B><DD>You can write programs that communicate and interact with your
server, via either the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or the
Internet Connection API (ICAPI).
For example, you can write a CGI program to generate a dynamic
response to user input, or you can write an ICAPI program to
customize the way errors are handled.
<P><DT><B>Support for server-side includes
</B><DD>You can insert dynamic (changing) information into HTML
documents and CGI programs that the server sends to clients.
For example, you can include the current date, the file size,
and the date of the last change to the file.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Customizable error messages
</B><DD>You can tailor the messages that your server returns to clients
when errors occur.
For example, you can modify a message to explain
how to fix a particular problem.
For internal networks, you might even include the name and number of
the contact person.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Support for multiple IP addresses
</B><DD>If you run your server on a machine with multiple
network addresses, you can configure it to serve different files
based on the IP address that a request comes in on.
For example, an Internet service provider can configure
a single server to supply multiple customers with Web sites with
differing welcome pages, mapping rules, and access control.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HDRMOREAB" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_6">Chapter 2. More about your server</A></H1>
<P>
The IBM Internet Connection Server and the IBM Internet Connection Secure Server
provide the foundation for building your
company's presence on the Internet.
Your business can use either of these servers on the World
Wide Web to reach customers and suppliers around the world.
Or you can use them within your business to communicate with employees.
<P>
With the IBM Internet Connection Secure Server, your business can implement
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Secure-HTTP, or both security protocols
to ensure that your business transactions are secure.
<P>
This chapter describes some of the key features of the servers.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_7" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_7">Installing and configuring the server</A></H2>
<P>
You can easily install the server using the
OS/2 installation tool, Software Installer.
<P>
After you install the server, you can start it using the
configuration values you specified during installation.
Default values are supplied for all the other configuration values.
Using a Web browser, you can then connect to the server.
<P>
By default, your server uses its Front Page
as its home page.
The Front Page provides a valuable assortment of
tools and information, including links to:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Configuration and Administration Forms
<LI>Sample Home Page
<LI>Internet Connection Family Web Site
<LI>Documentation
</UL>
For installation steps, see 
<A HREF="icsur006.html#HDRINS">Chapter 4. "Installing your server"</A>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_8" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_8">Using other programs with the server</A></H2>
<P>
The server supports the Common Gateway Interface (CGI),
which allows you to create external programs (CGI programs)
that interface with your server
and perform tasks such as searching and forwarding e-mail messages.
<P>
To assist you in writing CGI programs, the server
includes utilities for extracting forms data, writing
document headers, and processing image maps.
<P>The server also supports the Internet Connection
Application Programming Interface (ICAPI).
This interface is designed specifically for the server's
threaded processing and allows you to easily extend the server's
base functions.
Using the ICAPI you can write extensions to perform
site-specific processing, such as publishing customized
pages based on client's code level, enhancing the basic
authentication, and adding error routines to track problems
or alert you about serious conditions.
<P>
For more information, see the <CITE>Web Programming Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_9" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_9">Restricting access</A></H2>
<P>
Most likely, you will not want everyone to be able to access
all the information on your server.
For example, you probably would not want everyone to be able to
access your CGI programs.
<P>
You can restrict access based on user name and
password, or the address of the requester.
Access authorization is controlled using the configuration file and
possibly one or more other files, including:
<UL>
<P><LI>A protection setup file, which defines the protection being used
<P><LI>A password file, which allows you to define user names and
passwords
<P><LI>A group file, which allows you to define groups of user names
<P><LI>An Access Control List (ACL) file,
which allows you to define access
for individual files or groups of files on a protected directory
</UL>
For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_10" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_10">Mapping resources</A></H2>
<P>
You can create a virtual hierarchy of Web resources.
As part of the server's configuration, you can
specify resource mapping rules, which associate a request template with
the actual path to a document or resource.
Each request that comes to the
server is checked against these rules to determine if the request
should be accepted and where the requested resource is actually
located.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_11" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_11">Logging requests and errors</A></H2>
<P>
To help you determine whether or not your Internet message is reaching
the intended audience, you can keep
logs showing who is accessing your server and when.
You can also keep
logs of requests for cached files (if the server is a caching proxy),
and logs of internal server errors.
<P>
You can control what gets logged by filtering out entries that match
a particular pattern.
Your server automatically creates a report for each log, so you can
view the contents of the log.
You can modify these default report templates so that you include and/or
exclude log entries contained in the report.
<P>
Because the logs are written in a format that is common to most Web
servers, you can use any of several generic statistical programs to
analyze the log contents.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_12" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_12">Running the server as a caching proxy</A></H2>
<P>
When you configure your server
as a caching proxy server, you can improve performance, as
well as allow users of your internal network to access documents on
the Internet.
<P>
You can specify many configuration options for a
caching proxy, including:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Which files you want (and do not want) to store in cache
<LI>The maximum amount of space allotted to cache storage
<LI>Automatic reclamation of cache storage space
<LI>Routing of requests to other proxy servers
</UL>
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_13" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_13">Running the server with multiple IP addresses</A></H2>
<P>
When you run the server on a machine with
multiple network connections,
you can configure it to serve different files based on
the IP address of the network connection a request comes in on.
This is particularly valuable to Internet service
providers who want to use one server to provide Web sites for
multiple customers.
The server allows you to configure:
<UL>
<P><LI>Welcome Pages: to determine
how the server responds to requests that do not contain a file name.
<P><LI>Mapping Rules: to set
map requests to physical files and to determine
whether the server processes a request.
<P><LI>Access Control: to
activate different protection rules for
requests depending on which address the request comes in on.
</UL>
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_14" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_14">Using server-side includes</A></H2>
<P>Server-side includes allow you to insert information into
CGI programs and HTML documents that the server sends to the client.
The current date, the size of the file, the last change of a file
are examples of the kind of information that can be sent to the
client.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_15" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_15">Customizing the server's error messages</A></H2>
<P>You can customize the basic
CERN messages that your server sends
back to the client when error conditions
are encountered.
For example, you can change a message
to include more information about the cause of the
problem and suggest possible solutions to fix it.
For internal networks, you might provide
a contact person for your users to call.
<P>For more information, see the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.

<P>Before beginning to follow one of the installation procedures,
you need to decide what you want to install from and whether you
are installing for the first time or reinstalling.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_24" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_24">Choosing the installation medium</A></H3>
<P>
Choose one of the following media to install
your server from:
<DL>
<P><DT>
CD-ROM
<DD>
Get the CD-ROM from the server box and go to
<A HREF="#HDRISITFRS">"Choosing the type of installation to perform"</A>.
<P><DT>
Remote code server
<DD>
To install from a remote code server, you must first copy the
server product files from
CD-ROM onto the remote code server.
Also, your system must have a LAN connection to the remote code server
and you must have access to the directory where the server files are.
<P>
Because the
server complies with IBM&#39;s Configuration, Installation, and
Distribution (CID) architecture, you can automate installation
by using a CID response file.
The response file contains pre-set values for the installation
variables you are prompted for during a regular installation.
<P>If you <B><I>are not</I></B> using a response file, go to
<A HREF="#HDRISITFRS">"Choosing the type of installation to perform"</A>.
<P>If you <B><I>are</I></B> using a response file, go to
<A HREF="#HDRAUTOINS">"Automating installation"</A>.

<H2><A NAME="HDRAUTOINS" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_29">Automating installation</A></H2>
If you are installing the server
from a remote code
server, you can use a Configuration, Installation, and Distribution
(CID) response file to automatically install or update the server.
This section describes how to perform the following two types of
automated installation:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Remote attended installation
<LI>Remote unattended installation
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_30" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_30">Remote attended installation</A></H3>
<P>
If a remote code server has the server product files, the clients
of the code server can
perform a remote attended installation.
Clients must
meet the server
hardware and software requirements, have a LAN connection,
and have access to the remote code server
directory that contains the server product files.
For more information on hardware and software requirements, see
<A HREF="icsur005.html#HDRPLN">Chapter 3. "Planning for installation"</A>.
<P>
The code server must have a
server response file.
The response file contains pre-set values for the installation
variables.
The default response file for the server
is named websrvr.rsp.
The default response file contains comments that explain the
different variables and how to set them.
<P>
From the client where you want to install the server,
follow these instructions for a remote attended installation:
<OL>
<P><LI>Verify that you have access to the remote code server and that
the server response file

You can use a software distribution manager to
perform remote unattended installations of the server.
Remote unattended installation allows you to distribute software
from a software distribution manager to workstations.
You must have a network connection established between the

your server.
It also describes the first tasks you will
probably want to perform after installation.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRSTRSTO" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_35">Starting the server</A></H2>
<P>
This section describes how to start and stop your server
after you have finished installing it.
If you think the server is running but you do not see the window
for it on your OS/2 Desktop, press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>
to see the list of active OS/2 programs.
If the Window List contains an entry for the server, double click
the entry to bring the server's window into view.
<P>
If you are running the Internet Connection Server, you will see the message
<TT>Security not available. wwws.dll did not load</TT>.
This message lets you know that you are not running the
Internet Connection Secure Server.
You do not need to do anything in response to the message.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_36" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_36">Starting automatically from the OS/2 startup folder</A></H3>
<P>
If during installation you checked Auto Start Server at Bootup,
the server has been added to your OS/2 Startup folder.
Each time you start or reboot your system, the server will start.
If you rebooted your system after installing the server,
the server should be running now.
<P>
When you start the server automatically, it uses
the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_37" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_37">Starting from the Internet Connection Server icon</A></H3>
<P>
The installation procedure creates an Internet Connection Server
folder on your OS/2 Desktop.
Inside the folder is an icon for the Internet Connection Server.
To start the server, double click the icon.
<P>
The server starts with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_38" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_38">Starting from the command prompt</A></H3>
<P>
You can start the server from any OS/2 command prompt by entering:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>httpd</B>
</PRE>
<P>
This starts the server with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
The httpd command also accepts various options for changing
configuration settings at run time.
For details on the httpd command options,
see the <CITE>Webmaster&#39;s Guide</CITE>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_39" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_39">Starting multiple instances of the server</A></H3>
<P>
You can start multiple instances of the server,
but each instance must listen on a separate port.
All instances, other than the first, must be started
by entering the following command from a command prompt:
<P>
<B>httpd -r <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR></B>
<P>
where <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR> is a configuration file that
specifies the individual port.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_40" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_40">Restarting from the Internet Connection Server Window</A></H3>
<P>
You can restart your server from the Internet Connection Server window
by selecting <B>Restart server</B>
from the <B>File</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
The server reloads the configuration settings from
the configuration file it was originally started with.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_41" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_41">Stopping the server</A></H2>
<P>
You can stop the server the same ways you stop other OS/2 programs.
Do any of the following:
<UL>
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Server window and double click
the small icon in the top left corner.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Server window and select <B>Exit</B> from the
<B>File</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Server window and press <B>F3</B>.
<P><LI>Press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>.
With the right mouse button
click the Window List entry for the Internet Connection Server.
Click <B>Close</B>.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRVIEWFP" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_42">Viewing your server's Front Page</A></H2>
<P>
<P>
After your server is up and running, you can use WebExplorer or
any other Web browser to look at the server's Front Page.
<P>
If you started the server with the default configuration file
and you have not yet created your own home page,
you can view the Front Page by using your
browser to open the following URL:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/</B>
</PRE>
<P>Where <VAR>your.server.name</VAR> is
the fully qualified name of your host.
For example, http://www.ibm.com/.
<P>
The server's Front Page contains the following links:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Configuration and Administration Forms</B>.  A tool that lets
you configure your server by filling in a set of forms.
The forms are coded with the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
<P><LI><B>Sample Home Page</B>.  A sample document
that demonstrates how to use many of the HTML tags.
<P><LI><B>Internet Connection Family Web Site</B>.  From this Web
site, you can download beta versions of software under development,
product giveaways, accessory code, demo code, and other goodies.
You can also learn more about our retail products.
<P><LI><B>Documentation</B>.  An online HTML version of the following:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><CITE>Up and Running&#33;</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Web Programming Guide</CITE>
<LI><CITE>Web design information</CITE>
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
If you want to go to the Front Page after you create your own home
page, just include the Front Page file name on the URL.
The Front Page file name is Frntpage.html, so you would use the following URL
to see it:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/Frntpage.html</B>
</PRE>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRWHTNXT" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_43">What's next?</A></H2>
<P>
Now that your server is up and running, you'll probably
want to configure it to your own specifications.
Your server allows you to:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Modify the Configuration and Administration forms</B>
to easily
configure the default settings.
<P><LI><B>Change the default home page</B>
to have the server
return your own home page.
The home page is the document that your server returns when
a client sends a request that does not point to a specific directory
or file.
<P><LI><B>Change your document root directory</B>
to serve requests that do not point to a specific directory.
Your home page should always be on your home directory.
<P><LI><B>Run your server as a caching proxy</B> to
improve response time
by having the proxy server store the documents it receives from
other servers in a local cache.
<P><LI><B>Run a proxy server and standard server</B>
from the same host to
have the convenience of running two different servers from one host.
</UL>
These activities are described in the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE>.

<H1><A NAME="HDRCIDSYSL" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_52">Appendix A. Installing with SystemView</A></H1>
<P>You can use SystemView to install the Internet Connection Server on
unattended workstations using the statements included in
two files called a <I>software profile</I> and a
<I>response file</I>.
A software profile is used by SystemView to
invoke an application installation program.
A response file is used by the installation program to get all of the
data it needs during the installation process.
<P>
Using SystemView,
you specify the information for the software profile
and response files when you customize the application definition
file, which defines how to install and configure the Internet Connection Server.
This file is shipped with the Internet Connection Server.
<P>Refer to the SystemView documentation for a complete description
of software profiles and response files.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_53" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_53">Overview</A></H2>
<P>To install the Internet Connection Server on server workstations
using SystemView, you need to:
<UL>
<P><LI>Copy the Internet Connection Server files to the code server
<P><LI>Add the Internet Connection Server information to the SystemView software
library
<P><LI>Configure the Internet Connection Server in the SystemView software library
by placing it into the catalog at the distribution server
<P><LI>Distribute and install the resulting software object using
SystemView
on target server workstations
</UL>
<P>These tasks are described in the following sections.
If you need additional assistance to perform these
tasks, use the online help or refer to

you would enter this command:
<PRE>
XCOPY E&#58;\*.* D&#58;\CID\IMG\WEB /S
</PRE>
<P>
This command copies
the files from the root directory on the CD-ROM
in the E: drive to the D: drive, putting the files
under the directory \CID\IMG\WEB.
<P>
The /S indicates that all of the subdirectories
and their contents and the contents of the root directory
should be copied.
<HR>

If you are ready to distribute the Internet Connection Server, select <B>Yes</B>
when asked <B>Do you want to catalog the database?</B>.
<P>
Here is an overview of just a few of the pages you will
fill in.
<DL>
<P><DT><B>Configuration Page
</B><DD>
Use to define both an identifier needed to
catalog the Internet Connection Server uniquely and a
name that is a short description for the
configuration you are creating.
For example, the identifier may be <TT>EUROSERV</TT>
and the name may be <TT>Definition for the servers in Europe</TT>.
<P><DT><B>Code Server Page
</B><DD>
Use to associate the configuration with the redirection
mechanism to be used during CID installation.
Define the code server aliases and the CID directory
aliases that let the target workstation (where you want to
install the Internet Connection Server) access the code server images.
You also indicate whether an existing or new response
file will be used.
<P><DT><B>Response File Page
</B><DD>
Use to specify the name and directory where the existing
response file is located.
</DL>
<P>The remaining pages of the Settings notebook configure
the Internet Connection Server at the target server workstation.
SystemView uses the information from
the notebook to create the settings for the Internet Connection Server
variables in the response file.
Refer to the comments in the response file itself
(websrvr.rsp.) for more information about response file keywords.

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="HDRGLO" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_60">Appendix C. Glossary</A></H1>
<P>
This glossary defines terms used by the Internet Connection Server.
<DL>
<P><DT>accessory script
<DD>A CGI script program that processes SEARCH, POST, PUT, or DELETE
requests.  The accessory scripts process requests that are not explicitly
mapped to a CGI script program named on an EXEC directive.
<P><DT>address
<DD>The unique code assigned to each device or workstation connected to a
network.  A standard Internet address (or IP address) is a 32-bit address
field.  This field contains two parts.  The first part is the
network address;
the second part is the host number.   See also <I>IP address</I>.
<P><DT>alias
<DD>A name assigned to a server.  The alias makes the server independent
of the name of its host machine.  The alias must be defined in the domain
name server.
<P><DT>asymmetric keys
<DD>In secure communications, the two keys in a key pair.
The keys are called asymmetric because one key holds more of the
encryption pattern than the other does.
See <I>key pair</I>.
<P><DT>authentication
<DD>In secure communications,
a means of verifying the identity of a server or browser
(client) with
whom you wish to communicate.  A sender's authenticity is
demonstrated by the digital certificate issued to the sender.
See also <I>certificate</I>.
<P><DT>browser
<DD>A client program that initiates requests to a server and displays the
returned information.
<P><DT>cache
<DD>A special-purpose buffer storage, smaller and faster than
main storage, used
to hold a copy of data that may be frequently accessed.  Use of a cache
reduces access time, but may increase memory requirements.
<P><DT>caching proxy server
<DD>A proxy server that can store the documents it retrieves
from other servers
in a local cache.  The server can then respond to subsequent
requests for the
same documents without having to retrieve them from other servers.  This
can improve response time.
<P><DT>CERN
<DD>Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire (European Laboratory
for Particle Physics).
Located in Geneva, CERN initiated the World Wide Web, and was the first
to create a Web server.  The CERN Web server is the basis for many
commercially available servers, such as IBM's Internet Connection
servers.
<P><DT>certificate
<DD>In secure communications, a digital document
that binds an encryption
key to the identity of the certificate owner, so that the certificate
owner can be authenticated.
A certificate is issued by a certification authority (CA).
See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>certificate</I>, and
<I>certification authority (CA)</I>.
<P><DT>certification authority (CA)
<DD>In secure communications,
a trusted third party (such as VeriSign, Inc.) or a designated
internal authority who issues certificates.
See also <I>certificate</I>.
<P><DT>CGI (common gateway interface)
<DD>A standard interface between Web servers and external programs.  CGI
scripts are programs that use this interface to perform tasks not usually
done by the server, such as form processing.
<P><DT>CGI program
<DD>A program that uses the common gateway interface (CGI)
to perform tasks
not usually done by the server, such as form processing.
CGI programs can be written in any language supported by the operating
system on which the server is run.
The language can be a scripting language or a programming language.
<P><DT>client
<DD>A computer system or process that requests a service of
another computer
system or process.
For example, a workstation or personal computer
requesting HTML documents from an IBM Internet Connection Server
is a client of the IBM Internet Connection Server it connects to.
<P><DT>configuration file
<DD>A file that describes the devices, optional features, communications
parameters, and programs installed on a workstation.
For Internet Connection Server, the configuration file is named httpd.cnf and by default
is put in the
path specified on the SET ETC statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.
The configuration file
contains directives that define the various settings for the server.
<P><DT>default
<DD>A value, attribute, or option that is assumed when none is explicitly
specified.
<P><DT>directive
<DD>A statement used in the Internet Connection Server configuration file to define a
particular setting for the server.
<P><DT>directory
<DD>A named grouping of files in a file system.
<P><DT>Distinguished Name
<DD>In secure communications,
the name and address of the person and organization to whom a
certificate has been issued.
See also <I>certificate</I>.
<P><DT>document root directory
<DD>The primary directory where a Web server stores accessible documents.
When the server receives requests that do not point to
a specific directory, it tries to serve the request from this
directory.
<P><DT>domain
<DD>In an internet, a part of the naming hierarchy.
A domain name consists of a
sequence of names (labels) separated by periods (dots).
<P><DT>domain name
<DD>A name of a host system in a network.  A domain name consists of a
sequence of names (labels) separated by periods (dots).
<P><DT>domain name server
<DD>A server program that supplies address-to-name
translation by mapping Internet addresses to
domain names.
Use of a domain name server allows
users to request services of another computer using a symbolic name,
which is easier to remember than an Internet address.
<P><DT>dotted-decimal notation
<DD>The syntactical representation for a 32-bit integer that
consists of four 8-bit
numbers, written in base 10 and separated by periods (dots).
It is used to
represent IP addresses.
<P><DT>encryption
<DD>In secure communications,
a means of scrambling data to prevent the data from being read by
anyone other than the intended recipient.  The sender uses a key to
encrypt the message; the recipient uses the decryption key.
See also <I>key</I> and <I>key pair</I>.
<P><DT>file extension
<DD>The last part of a file&#39;s name, following the period (dot).
For example, in the
filename welcome.html, the file extension is html.
<P><DT>firewall
<DD>A computer that connects a private network, such as a business,
to a public
network, such as the Internet.  It contains programs that limit
the access between two networks.  See also <I>proxy gateway</I>.
<P><DT>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
<DD>An application protocol used for transferring files to and from host
computers.  FTP requires a user ID, and a password to allow
access to files on a remote host system.
<P><DT>gateway
<DD>A functional unit that connects a local data network with
another network.
See also <I>proxy gateway</I>.
<P><DT>Gopher
<DD>The protocol, developed at the University of Minnesota,
that provides a
menu-driven interface for accessing files and information on other
computers.
<P><DT>home page
<DD>The welcome page on
the document root directory of a Web server.
Commonly used as the
entry point for the contents of the server.
See also <I>welcome page</I>.
<P><DT>host
<DD>A computer, connected to a network, which provides
an access point to that

See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>key pair</I>, and
<I>key ring</I>.
<P><DT>key pair
<DD>In secure communications,
a public key and a private key.  The sender uses the private key
to encrypt the message; the recipient uses the public key to decrypt
the message.  Because the private key holds more
of the encryption pattern than the public key does, the key
pair is called asymmetric.
See also <I>public key</I> and <I>private key</I>.
<P><DT>key ring
<DD>In secure communications,
a file that contains public keys, private keys, trusted roots, and
certificates.

to protect access to your key ring.
See also <I>key ring</I>.
<P><DT>port
<DD>An end point for communication between applications,
generally referring to
a logical connection.  A port provides queues for sending
and receiving data.
Each port has a port number for identification.  When the port number is
combined with an Internet address, it is called a socket address.
<P><DT>private key
<DD>In secure communications,
an algorithmic pattern used to encrypt messages that can be
decrypted only by the corresponding public key.  A private key is
also used to decrypt messages that were encrypted by the corresponding
public key.
You keep your private key on your own system in a key
ring, protected by a password.
See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>public key</I>, and
<I>key ring</I>.
<P><DT>protection setup
<DD>A group of protection subdirectives that
work together to define how the server should control access to

in separate protection setup files, or by using the
Configuration and Administration forms.
<P><DT>protocol
<DD>The set of rules governing the operation of functional units of a
communication system if communication is to take place.  Protocols can
determine low-level details of machine-to-machine interfaces, such as the

high-level
exchanges between application programs, such as file transfer.
<P><DT>proxy gateway
<DD>A type of firewall that protects computers in a business network
from access
by users outside that network.  See also <I>firewall</I>.
<P><DT>proxy server
<DD>A server that can retrieve documents from other servers for
its clients.
<P><DT>public key
<DD>In secure communications,
an algorithmic pattern used to decrypt messages that were
encrypted by the corresponding private key.  A public key is
also used to encrypt messages that can only be decrypted by
the corresponding private key.
You broadcast your public key to everyone who will
need to exchange encrypted messages with you.
See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>private key</I>, and
<I>key ring</I>.
<P><DT>README file
<DD>A file containing information and instructions for using the
associated
program or programs

<P><DT>S-HTTP
<DD>Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
S-HTTP is a popular security protocol that is a security-enhanced
variation of HTTP proposed by Enterprise Integration Technologies
(EIT).
S-HTTP allows servers and clients to authenticate each other
and agree on the kind of security they will use in transmissions.
See also <I>authentication</I> and <I>SSL</I>.
<P><DT>SSL
<DD>Secure Sockets Layer.
SSL is a popular security scheme developed by Netscape Communications
Corp., along with RSA Data Security, Inc.
SSL allows the client to authenticate the server and all
data and requests to be encrypted.
The URL of a secure server protected by
SSL begins with https (rather than http).
See also <I>authentication</I> and <I>S-HTTP</I>.
<P><DT>subdirectory

<H2><A NAME="HDRNEW41" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_3">What's new in Version 4.1</A></H2>
<P>
Enhancements for this version include:
<DL>
<P><DT><B>Improved logging and reporting
</B><DD>You can control the access requests that your server logs.  You can
also create and view reports based on the information in your access
logs.  You can customize your reports or use any of the report
templates that are provided.
<P><DT><B>Support for user-written programs that interface with your server
</B><DD>You can write programs that communicate and interact with your
server, via either the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or the
Internet Connection API (ICAPI).
For example, you can write a CGI program to generate a dynamic
response to user input, or you can write an ICAPI program to
customize the way errors are handled.
<P><DT><B>Support for server-side includes
</B><DD>You can insert dynamic (changing) information into HTML
documents and CGI programs that the server sends to clients.
For example, you can include the current date, the file size,
and the date of the last change to the file.
<P><DT><B>Customizable error messages
</B><DD>You can tailor the messages that your server returns to clients
when errors occur.
For example, you can modify a message to explain
how to fix a particular problem.
For internal networks, you might even include the name and number of
the contact person.
<P><DT><B>Support for multiple IP addresses
</B><DD>If you run your server on a machine with multiple
network addresses, you can configure it to serve different files
based on the IP address that a request comes in on.
For example, an Internet service provider can configure
a single server to supply multiple customers with Web sites with
differing welcome pages, mapping rules, and access control.

Your server is operational once you install it.
After you have the server installed and running, you will probably
want to change some parts of the
default configuration file to make the server meet your
own particular needs.
<P>
This chapter explains what you can change about your server&#39;s
configuration, as well as how to change these items, by using the
Configuration and Administration forms or by editing the
configuration file.

<H2><A NAME="Header_6" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_6">Configuring your server</A></H2>
<P>
You can configure your server either by using the
Configuration and Administration forms or by editing the
server&#39;s configuration file.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRUSING">Using the Configuration and Administration forms</A></H3>
<P>
The server comes with Configuration and Administration
forms.
These forms are a combination of CGI programs and HTML forms
that provide an easy way for you to configure your server or to
view your server's current configuration settings.
<P>
Once the server is running,
you can use the Configuration and Administration forms.
You can use the forms from WebExplorer (or any other Web browser).
The browser can be on the same machine as the server or on any
remote client that has access to the server.
<P>Following are the steps for using the Configuration and
Administration forms.
<OL>
<P><LI>
Disable caching on your browser.
Also, if you are configuring your server remotely from a browser
that uses that specific server as its proxy server,
you should disable the proxy server setting on your browser.
<P><LI>
Using your browser, go to the server's Front Page
by typing the following URL:
<PRE>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/</B>
</PRE>
<P>where <VAR>your.server.name</VAR> is the fully qualified name
of your host; for example, http://www.ibm.com/
<P>
<P><LI>
Click
<B>Configuration and Administration Forms</B>.
<P><LI>
If you have not used the Configuration and Administration forms
since starting your browser, you will be prompted for a user name
and password.
<P>
Enter the user name and password you specified in the
<B>Administrator ID</B> and <B>Password</B> fields during
installation.
If you did not change the installation defaults,
the authorized user name is <TT>webadmin</TT> and the authorized
password is <TT>webibm</TT>.
If you did not change the defaults during installation, it is
strongly recommended that you do so now to prevent unauthorized
access to your server configuration.
See 
<A HREF="#HDRCONTACC">"Controlling access to the Configuration and Administration forms"</A>.
<P>
After you enter an authorized user name and password,
you go to
the Configuration and Administration Forms page.
<P><LI>
From the Configuration and Administration Forms page,
you can link to each of the input forms by clicking
on the form name.
<P>
When you go to a form,
it is displayed with the current configuration values in its input
fields.
(If you haven&#39;t changed your configuration since installation,
these are the default values.)
<P><LI>
From any form,
enter information about how you want to
configure that particular part of your server.
<P>
Each form provides instructions
to assist you in deciding what changes to make.
For further information, you can click the help icon at
the bottom of each form.
The help icon links you to a help page that
provides detailed steps for using the form to perform
particular tasks.
<P><LI>
After you fill in the form, you must
click <B>Apply</B> to indicate you want to update the server
configuration with the changes you made.
The <B>Apply</B> button is located below the input fields on each
form.
<P>
If you decide you do not want to use the changes you made to the form,
click <B>Reset</B>.
This returns the fields on the form
to the values they had when you first came to the form.
<P><B>Note: </B>A few of the form pages have more than one set of <B>Apply</B>
and <B>Reset</B> buttons.
These pages are actually treated as multiple forms.
If you click <B>Apply</B> or <B>Reset</B>, the action
takes place only for the portion of the page associated with that
set of buttons.
<P><LI>
If you clicked on <B>Apply</B>,
the server shows you a message indicating whether your input was
accepted.
If the input was accepted, you see a Confirmation page that
tells you what configuration directives were updated.
<P>
If the input was not accepted, you see a Configuration Error page
explaining what was wrong with the information you entered.
Go back to the form and try to correct the information.
From the form you may also want to click the help icon at the bottom
of the form.
<P><LI>
If the Confirmation page contains a <B>Restart Server</B> button,
you can click it to have the server restart and begin using
the configuration changes you just made.
<P>
If the Confirmation page does not contain a <B>Restart Server</B>
button, then you need to stop your server and start it again for the
configuration changes you made to take effect.
For instructions on stopping and starting your server, see
<A HREF="icswg004.html#HDRSTR">"Starting and stopping your server"</A>.
</OL>
<P><B>Note: </B>From the Confirmation page or the Restart Confirmation page,
use the <B>Configuration Page</B> button to return to the
Configuration and Administration forms.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDREDITI">Editing the configuration file</A></H3>
<P>
The other way to configure your server is
by editing the configuration file.
<P>
By default, the configuration file is named httpd.cnf and
is in the path specified on the SET ETC
statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
The configuration file is made up of statements called
<B><I>directives</I></B>.
You change your configuration by editing the configuration file,
updating the directives, and saving your changes.
<P>
When you restart the server, your changes take effect, unless
you changed one of the following directives:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Port
<LI>SSLMode
<LI>SSLPort
<LI>NormalMode
<LI>KeyFile
<LI>imbeds
</UL>
<P>
If you changed one of the directives in the above list,
you must stop the server and start it again.
For instructions on stopping and starting your server, see
<A HREF="icswg004.html#HDRSTR">"Starting and stopping your server"</A>.
<P>
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRCFR">"Using the configuration file"</A> describes each of the configuration file directives.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRCONTACC" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_9">Controlling access to the Configuration and Administration forms</A></H2>
<P>
After installation,
your server has one authorized user name and one
password that can be used
to access the
Configuration and Administration forms.
<P>
You specified the authorized user name and password in the
<B>Administrator ID</B> and <B>Password</B> fields during
installation.
If you did not change the installation defaults,
the authorized user name is <TT>webadmin</TT> and the authorized
password is <TT>webibm</TT>.
<P>
The user name and password are stored in the ADMIN.PWD password file,
which is located in the path specified by the SET ETC statement in your
CONFIG.SYS file.
<P>
If you have not yet changed the default user name or
password, you should do so
now to prevent unauthorized access to the Configuration and
Administration forms.
<P>
You can
use either the htadm command or the Configuration and Administration
forms to control user names, passwords, and
password files.
<P>
If you just want to change the password for the default user name
with the htadm command, you would enter the following:
<PRE>
<B>
   htadm -passwd <VAR>d&#58;\setetc\</VAR>ADMIN.PWD <VAR>user-name password</VAR>
</B>
</PRE>
In the above example:
<UL>
<P><LI>
<B><VAR>d&#58;\setetc\</VAR></B>
is the path specified on the SET ETC statement
in your CONFIG.SYS file.
<P><LI>
<VAR>user-name</VAR>
is the name you entered for <B>Administrator ID</B>
at installation.
The installation default is <TT>webadmin</TT>.
<P><LI>
<VAR>password</VAR> is the new password you want to use.
</UL>
See 
<A HREF="icswg014.html#HDRHTADM">"htadm command"</A> for complete
instructions on how to use the htadm command.

One of the first configuration tasks you
will want to perform is changing your server so that it returns your
own <B><I>home page</I></B>.
The home page is the document that your server returns when
a client sends a request that does not point to a specific directory
or file.
So when a client sends a URL in the format of:
<PRE>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/</B>
</PRE>
your server responds by sending back your home page.
When you first start the server,
the server uses the Front Page as your home page
and uses the default configuration file.
<P>
Configuration settings tell your
server where to look for your home page and what its name is.
So that you can understand how this works,
this section contains background information about the
document root directory and the welcome page list.
The section then
describes an easy way to create your own home page and
have the server use it instead of the server's Front Page.
<P><B>Note: </B>Some Web browsers use the term "home page"
to also refer to the first page that the browser
loads when it is started.
This document uses the term only to refer to the server home page.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRDROOT">Understanding the document root directory</A></H3>
<P>
When the server receives requests that do not point to
a specific directory, it tries to serve the request from the
<B><I>document root directory</I></B>.
Because you want your home page to be returned for requests that do
not specify a directory or file name, you need to have your home page
in your document root directory.
<P>
The document root directory is the directory you
specified as your HTML directory during installation.
If you used the installation defaults, the document root directory is
C&#58;\WWW\HTML.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRCDOCRT">Changing your document root directory</A></H3>
<P>
At some point you may decide to change the directory your server
uses for its document root directory.
See 
<A HREF="#HDRDROOT">"Understanding the document root directory"</A> for a description of the document root directory
and its default value.
<P>
For example, you
might want to change your document root directory
if you are creating a new set of HTML documents for your server to
use.
While you are creating the new documents,
you might want to keep them on a directory not accessible to the server.
<P>
Follow these steps to change your document root directory:
<OL>
<P><LI>From the Configuration and Administration forms page,
click <B>Request Routing</B>.
(If you're not sure how to access the Forms, see 
<A HREF="#HDRUSING">"Using the Configuration and Administration forms"</A>.)
<P><LI>On the Request Routing form,
select the <B>Replace</B> button.
<P><LI>Change the <B>Index</B> field to the number
of the Pass rule that has /* as its URL request template.
<P><LI>Change the <B>Action</B> field to <B>Pass</B>.

<P><LI>Enter your new document root directory in the
<B>Replacement file path</B> field.
<P><LI>Click <B>Apply</B>.
<P><LI>From the Confirmation page, click <B>Restart Server</B>.
<P>After restarting, the server begins to use the new document root
directory.
</OL>
<P>
So now you know where your server looks for your home page, but how
does it know which file to return?
This is defined by the list of welcome pages.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_13">Understanding the default list of welcome pages</A></H3>
<P>
The server&#39;s configuration defines a list of file names that the
server can use as <B><I>welcome pages</I></B>.
These are the files
the server looks for when it
receives URL requests that do not specify a file name.
<P>
For requests that do not specify either a directory or file name,
you want the server to return your home page.
As described in the previous section, the server looks for your
home page on the document root directory.
It then
determines which file contains your home page by matching the
list of welcome pages to the files in the directory.
The first match it finds is the file it returns as your home page.
<P>
The default configuration file defines a list of four welcome pages.
The order of the welcome pages is important because the
server goes down the list from top to bottom when looking for
the file it should return.
<P>
The default welcome page
file names and their default order are:
<OL COMPACT>
<LI>Welcome.html
<LI>index.html
<LI>Frntpage.html
</OL>
<P>
The server returns the first file it finds that matches a file name
in the list.
<P>
For example, if you are using the default configuration and your
document root directory does not contain a
file named Welcome.html, but does contain files
named index.html and Frntpage.html, the index.html file is used as your home
page.
<P>
For more information on welcome pages and how they are used by
directories other than the document root directory, see
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRDIREC">"Directories and Welcome Page - Set viewing options"</A>.
<P>
The easiest way to have your server start returning your own
home page is to create the page in a file named Welcome.html
and store the file on your document root directory.
The next section explains how to do this.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRXCHP">Creating your own home page</A></H3>
<P>
You can use any HTML document for your home page.
<P>
If you already have a document you want to use as your home page,
just copy it onto your document root directory and rename it to
Welcome.html or index.html.
<P>
If you want to create a new home page and have your server start using
it, you can use the following procedure:
<OL>
<P><LI>Using your browser, go to the server's Front Page
by typing the following URL:
<PRE>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/</B>

the fully qualified name of your host.
For example, http://www.ibm.com/.
<P><LI>Click <B>Sample Home Page</B>.
<P><LI>From WebExplorer select <B>Save as</B> from the <B>File</B>
pull-down menu on the menu bar.

<P><LI>Save the file with a name of
Welcome.html and put it on the document root directory.
Your home page must be placed on your root

requests that do not point to a specific directory.
<P><LI>
Use your choice of editors to edit the new Welcome.html file
and turn it into your own home page masterpiece.

<P>
Need some help with HTML?
Depending upon your current level of expertise with HTML, there
are many sources of information available.
<UL>
<P><LI>The Internet Connection Family Home Page, which is a link from
the server's front page, allows you to
download beta code, giveaways, retail products,

</UL>
<P>
You can write your HTML documents using any editor capable of producing

caching proxy
<LI>How to control who can use the caching proxy server
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_16">Overview of caching proxy servers</A></H3>
<P>
Clients connected to a <B><I>proxy server</I></B> can ask
the server to retrieve documents
for them from other servers.
Optionally, you can also use
<B><I>caching</I></B> to have the proxy server store the
documents it retrieves from other servers in a local cache.
The server can
then respond to subsequent requests for the same documents without having
to retrieve them from other servers.
This can improve response time.
<P>
Within an internal network you may want to set up
a server as a caching proxy to
reduce the amount of traffic on the network.
In large networks you can
connect a hierarchy of caching proxies.
A client request cascades up through
the hierarchy of servers until the document is retrieved
from a server&#39;s cache
or from the actual server where the document resides.
<P>
You can also set up your server to be a proxy
with access to the external network through a
<B><I>firewall machine</I></B>,
such as the IBM Internet Connection Secured Network Gateway.
A firewall machine is connected to both your
internal network and the external
Internet.
Users of the internal network are inside the firewall,
but the proxy server allows them to have access to the Internet.
The firewall machine can
also be set up to prevent external machines from reaching your internal
network.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRCACPS">Configuring a proxy server</A></H3>
<P>
The first step to configuring your server as a caching proxy is to
specify which protocols you want your server to be able to
act as a proxy for.
You do this by adding Pass rules for the protocols to
your server&#39;s list of mapping rules.
The Pass rules enable your server to act as a proxy.
<P>
<OL>
<P><LI>From the Configuration and Administration forms page, click

<P><LI>
In the <B>URL request template</B> field, enter a URL template
for a protocol you want your server to be able to act as a proxy for.
<P>
For example, to enable your server to act as a proxy for requests
using the common protocols that the server itself can serve,
you would enter one of the following:
<PRE>
<B>http&#58;*</B>
<B>ftp&#58;*</B>
<B>gopher&#58;*</B>

<P>
<P>
The proxy protocol can be http or ftp; a secure server can
additionally support https or shttp.
For a Secure WebExplorer client and an Internet Connection Secure Server:
<UL>
<P><LI>If the URL specifies shttp and the proxy protocol is
http, https, or shttp, then there is an end-to-end secure connection

<P><LI>If the URL specifies http or https and the proxy protocol
is http, https, or shttp, then:
<UL>
<P><LI>The kind of connection between the client and the proxy is governed
by the proxy protocol.
If the proxy protocol is a secure protocol (https or shttp), then
the connection between the client and the proxy will be secure.
If the proxy protocol is http, then
the connection between the client and the proxy will not be secure.
<P><B>Note: </B>When the proxy protocol is shttp and the URL specifies http or
https, the client sends a signed but unencrypted request to the proxy.
<P><LI>The kind of connection from the proxy to the server is governed
by what is specified in the URL.
If the URL specifies https, the
connection between the proxy and the server will be secure.
If the URL specifies http, the connection between the proxy and
the server will not be secure.
</UL>
<P><LI>The lock will be displayed on Secure WebExplorer if the URL specifies
https or shttp.
This means, at minimum, there is a secure connection between the

<H2><A NAME="HDRMULTIIP" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_23">Running your server with multiple IP addresses</A></H2>
<P>
You can install your server on a machine with
multiple network connections.
If you do,
you can configure the server to serve different files based on
the IP address of the network connection a request comes in on.
This can be of particular value if you
are an Internet service
provider and want to use one server to provide Web sites for
multiple customers.
<P>
For example, you may have two customers (customerA and customerB), both
of whom want to make information about their companies
available on the World Wide Web.
The expected number of requests for the information
is not great enough that you want to have a separate machine
for each customer.
<P>
If you have only one network connection and
run two instances of the server on the same machine, then only
one server has the benefit of using the default port number.
Requests to the other server would have to include a port number.
<P>
If your machine has two network connections,
you can run just one instance of the server and assign each customer to
a different IP address.
For each IP address you would define a different host name.
So customerA could be www.customerA.com on IP address 9.67.106.79 and
customerB could be www.customerB.org on IP address 9.83.100.45.
You can then configure the server to serve a different set
of information depending on the IP address the request comes in on.
Because the server can accept requests from the default port of
each network connection, requests to either host name would not require
a port number.
<P>
The way you configure the server to serve different information for
each customer is by indicating that certain parts of your configuration
apply only to requests coming in on certain addresses
(or addresses that match a template).
You can configure three key parts of your server
so that requests are processed differently
based on the IP address they come in on:
<UL>
<P><LI>Welcome pages.
<P>
You can specify
a different set of file names to use as welcome
pages depending on the address a request comes in on.
The file names you define as welcome pages determine
how the server responds to requests that do not
contain a file name.
<P>
For example, you might want to specify that homeA.html is a
welcome page only for
requests received on 9.67.106.79; and homeB.html is a
welcome page only for
requests received on an address matching the
template 9.83.*.
<P>
From the Configuration and Administration forms page,

by clicking on <B>Initial Page</B>.
From the Initial Page form,
click the help icon for information on defining welcome pages and
how to associate a
welcome page file name with an IP address or IP address template.
<P>
Alternatively, if you are editing the configuration file, you can add an
<VAR>IP-address-template</VAR>
parameter at the end of a Welcome directive to associate a
welcome page file name with an IP address or IP address template.
For details, see the description of the Welcome directive
in 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRDIREC">"Directories and Welcome Page - Set viewing options"</A>.
<P><LI>Mapping rules.
<P>
You can specify
a different set of mapping rules for the
server to use
depending on the address a request comes in on.
Mapping rules map a request to a physical file on
the server and
determine whether the server processes a request.
<P>
For example, you might want to specify that a
request beginning /cgi-bin/ received on address
9.67.106.79 is mapped to the /customerA/cgi/ directory; and the
same request received on an address matching the template 9.83.*,
is mapped to the /customerB/cgi/ directory.
<P>
From the Configuration and Administration forms page,
you can configure your mapping rules
by clicking on <B>Request Routing</B>.
From the Request Routing form,
click the help icon for information on how to use mapping rules and
how to associate a
mapping rule with an IP address or IP address template.
<P>
Alternatively, if you are editing the configuration file, you can add an
<VAR>IP-address-template</VAR>
parameter at the end of Exec, Fail, Map, Pass, and Redirect
directives to associate the directive
with an IP address or IP address template.
For details, see the description of these directives
in 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRMAPPI">"Resource mapping - Redirect URLs and define file extensions"</A>.
<P><LI>Access Control.
<P>
You can activate different protection
rules for a request based on the address the request comes in on.
Protection rules are defined in protection setups and
determine how your server controls access to
files and programs.
<P>
For example, you might want to specify that a
request beginning /cgi-bin/ received on address
9.67.106.79 is protected by the rules in a
protection setup named PROT-A;
and the
same request received on an address matching the template 9.83.*,
is protected by the rules in a

<H1><A NAME="HDRSTR" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_25">Starting and stopping your server</A></H1>
<P>
This chapter contains basic instructions for starting and stopping
your server.
It also describes the first tasks you will
probably want to perform after installation.
<P>
<P>Partial Table-of-Contents

</MENU><P>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRSTRSTO" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_26">Starting the server</A></H2>
<P>
This section describes how to start and stop your server
after you have finished installing it.
If you think the server is running but you do not see the window
for it on your OS/2 Desktop, press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>
to see the list of active OS/2 programs.
If the Window List contains an entry for the server, double click
the entry to bring the server's window into view.
<P>
If you are running the Internet Connection Server, you will see the message
<TT>Security not available. wwws.dll did not load</TT>.
This message lets you know that you are not running the
Internet Connection Secure Server.
You do not need to do anything in response to the message.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_27">Starting automatically from the OS/2 startup folder</A></H3>
<P>
If during installation you checked Auto Start Server at Bootup,
the server has been added to your OS/2 Startup folder.
Each time you start or reboot your system, the server will start.
If you rebooted your system after installing the server,
the server should be running now.
<P>
When you start the server automatically, it uses
the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_28">Starting from the Internet Connection Server icon</A></H3>
<P>
The installation procedure creates an Internet Connection Server
folder on your OS/2 Desktop.
Inside the folder is an icon for the Internet Connection Server.
To start the server, double click the icon.
<P>
The server starts with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_29">Starting from the command prompt</A></H3>
<P>
You can start the server from any OS/2 command prompt by entering:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
<B>httpd</B>
</PRE>
<P>
This starts the server with the current configuration settings.
If you have not changed the server configuration since installation,
the current configuration is based on the information you
entered during installation along with defaults.
<P>
The httpd command also accepts various options for changing
configuration settings at run time.
For details on the httpd command options,
see 
<A HREF="icswg014.html#HDRHTTPD">"httpd command"</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_30">Starting multiple instances of the server</A></H3>
<P>
You can start multiple instances of the server,
but each instance must listen on a separate port.
All instances, other than the first, must be started
by entering the following command from a command prompt:
<P>
<B>httpd -r <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR></B>
<P>
where <VAR>other_rule_file</VAR> is a configuration file that
specifies the individual port.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_31">Restarting from the Internet Connection Server Window</A></H3>
<P>
You can restart your server from the Internet Connection Server window
by selecting <B>Restart server</B>
from the <B>File</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
The server reloads the configuration settings from
the configuration file it was originally started with.
<P>
Most changes you have made to the configuration file
will be used by the server after it restarts.
However, if you changed a port setting or security settings, you need
to stop your server and start it again for those changes to take effect.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_32">Restarting from the Configuration and Administration Forms</A></H3>
<P>
When using the Configuration and Administration Forms, you are sometimes
given the option of restarting the server after you apply changes.
See 
<A HREF="icswg003.html#HDRUSING">"Using the Configuration and Administration forms"</A> for more information.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_33" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_33">Stopping the server</A></H2>
<P>
You can stop the server the same ways you stop other OS/2 programs.
Do any of the following:
<UL>
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Server window and double click
the small icon in the top left corner.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Server window and select <B>Exit</B> from the
<B>File</B> pull-down menu on the menu bar.
<P><LI>Go to the Internet Connection Server window and press <B>F3</B>.
<P><LI>Press <B>Ctrl+Esc</B>.
With the right mouse button
click the Window List entry for the Internet Connection Server.
Click <B>Close</B>.

Overview
<P>
Each directive description includes:
<UL>
<P><LI>Heading with the directive name and a brief description
<P><LI>Usage instructions
<P><LI>Example of how the directive might appear in the configuration
file
<P>Each configuration directive follows the same general syntax:
<PRE>
   DirectiveName <VAR>value</VAR>
</PRE>
<P><LI>Default value or values of the directive
<P>These are the original
values coded in the default configuration file.
(Change only the parts of the configuration file
that you want to be different from the default settings.)
</UL>
<P>For a list of the new directives added in Version 4.1,
see 
<A HREF="icswg002.html#SPTNEWDIRS">reference #1</A>.
<P>Some directives (the <VAR>value</VAR> portion) contain
templates for requests, path names, or host names.
Except where otherwise indicated,
you can use the asterisk (*) character in templates.
For the template to be matched, an asterisk can be replaced by
any character string or single character.
<P>
The examples and defaults in this chapter
use the backslash (\) character
when showing a path name.
In the configuration file,
you can actually use either the
backslash or forward slash (/) character when specifying a path name.
Always use the forward slash (/) when specifying a URL or request
template.
<P>Several configuration directives allow you to specify a positive
string.  You can enter any of the following words&#58;
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Yes
<LI>On
<LI>OK
<LI>Enable
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="HDRBASIC" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_37">Basic - Specify required settings</A></H2>
Basic
<P>
Use the directives described in this section to
control your server&#39;s basic configuration settings.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRBINDSPE">BindSpecific - Specify if the server binds to one or all IP addresses</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive on a multi-homed system to run a different server
on each IP address.  All the servers may listen on the same port.
<P>
If you specify On, the server binds to the IP address specified in the
HostName directive only, instead of binding to all local IP addresses.
<P>
If you change this directive, you must stop the server and then
start it again.  The server will not pick up the change if you
only restart it.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_39">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   BindSpecific On
</PRE>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_40">Default:</A></H5>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRDNSLOOK">DNS-Lookup - Specify whether you want to look up host names of clients</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify whether you want your server to look up
the host name of requesting clients.
<P>
The value you use affects the following things about how your server
works:
<UL>
<P><LI>The performance of the server.
Using the default value of <TT>Off</TT> improves the performance of
the server because it does not use resources to perform the host name
lookup.
<P><LI>The way your server identifies clients when writing to log files.
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><TT>Off</TT> - Clients identified by IP address
<LI><TT>On</TT> - Clients identified by host name
</UL>
<P><LI>Whether you can use host names on address templates in
protection setups, server group files, and ACL files.
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><TT>Off</TT> - Cannot use host names on address templates; must
use IP addresses
<LI><TT>On</TT> - Can use host names on address templates; cannot use
IP addresses
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_42">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   DNS-Lookup   On
</PRE>

<PRE>
   DNS-Lookup   Off
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRHOSTN">HostName - Specify the fully qualified domain name or IP address for the server</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the domain name or an IP address returned
to clients from document requests.  If you specify a domain name,
a domain name server is required to resolve the name into an IP
address.  If you specify an IP address, the domain name server is
not needed.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_45">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   HostName <VAR>name</VAR> or <VAR>IP address</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_46">Default</A></H5>
<P>
The name you specified for <B>Host name</B>
during installation.
The installation default is the default host name defined in your
domain name server.
If you remove this directive, the default host name defined in your
domain name server is used.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRIMBEDS">imbeds - Specify whether server-side includes will be dynamically imbedded</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify whether server-side includes will be
used in HTML documents, CGI programs, or both.
<P>
You can use server-side includes to dynamically insert
information, such as the date, the size of a file, the last
change of a file, into HTML documents, CGI programs, or both.
For more information on using server-side includes, see
<A HREF="icswg007.html#HDRSSI">"Using server-side includes"</A>.
<P>
For a secure server, if you implement S-HTTP,
you can use server-side includes to dynamically insert information,
such as a certificate or distinguished name, into HTML documents,
CGI programs, or both.
For more information on using server-side includes with S-HTTP,
see 
<A HREF="icswg011.html#HDRSHTTP">"Using Secure HTTP"</A>.
<P>
Using server-side includes can affect the server's performance and
slow down response time to clients.
<P>
If you change this directive, you must stop your server and then
start it again for the change to take effect.
The server will not pick up the change if you only restart it.
<P>
The format of this directive is:
<P>
<PRE>
imbeds <VAR>value</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
<VAR>value</VAR> can be:
<DL>
<P><DT><B>on &#91;<VAR>extension</VAR>&#93;
</B><DD>
Server-side includes will be used in HTML documents and CGI programs.
<P>
The server checks each HTML document and the output of each
CGI program it processes for server-side includes.
When you also specify <VAR>extension</VAR>,
the server checks the output of each CGI program,
but only checks those HTML documents
with the extension you specified for server-side includes.
<P><DT><B>files &#91;<VAR>extension</VAR>&#93;
</B><DD>
Server-side includes will be used in HTML documents.
<P>
The server checks each HTML document
it processes for server-side includes.
When you also specify <VAR>extension</VAR>,
the server checks only those HTML documents
with the extension you specified for server-side includes.
<P><DT><B>cgi
</B><DD>
Server-side includes will be used in CGI programs.
<P>
The server checks the output of each CGI program
it processes for server-side includes.
<P><DT><B>off

</DL>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_48">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   imbeds on .html
</PRE>
Server-side includes will be used in HTML documents and CGI scripts.
The server will check the output of each CGI program and each HTML
document with a file extension of .html for server-side includes.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_49">Default:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   imbeds on .shtml
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRPORT">Port - Specify the port on which you want the server to listen for requests</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the port number
the server should listen to for requests.
The standard port number for HTTP is 80.
Other port numbers
less than 1024 are reserved for other TCP/IP
applications and should not be used.
Common ports used for proxy Web servers are 8080 and 8008.
<P>
When a port
other than 80 is used, clients are required to include a
specific port number
on requests to the server.
The port number is preceded by a colon and
placed after the host name on the URL.
For example, the URL,
<PRE>
   http://www.turfco.com&#58;8008/
</PRE>
requests the default welcome page from a host named
www.turfco.com that is listening on port 8008.
<P>
You can use the -p option
on the httpd command
to override this setting when starting the server.
<P>
If you change this directive, you must stop your server and then
start it again for the change to take effect.
The server will not pick up the change if you only restart it.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_51">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   Port 8080
</PRE>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="HDRDIREC" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_56">Directories and Welcome Page - Set viewing options</A></H2>
Directories and Welcome Page
<P>
Use the directives described in this section to
control how your server responds to requests containing a
directory name.
You can have the server search the directory for a welcome file to
return, or you can have the server generate a directory listing.
<P>
By default, the server first looks for a welcome file.
If no welcome file is
present, the server displays a directory listing.
Configuration settings control how
directory listings appear and the icons that the listings use.
<P>
The server provides a set of default
icons to use for directory listings.
You can replace these icons with others using some of the directives
described in this section.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRADDBNKI">AddBlankIcon - Specify the icon URL used to align the heading of directory listings</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify an icon to use for aligning the heading
on directory listings.
This can either be a blank icon or another icon
you want to appear on the headings of your directory listings.
For proper alignment, the
icon you use must be the same size as the other icons you are
using on your directory listings.
The format of the directive is:
<PRE>
   AddBlankIcon   <VAR>icon-URL   alternate-text</VAR>

<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>icon-URL</VAR>
<P><DD>The last part of the URL for the icon.
The server adds this value to the value of the IconPath
directive to form the complete URL request.
If the request is for a local file, the server translates the
request through the mapping directives.
For the icon to be
retrieved, the mapping directives must allow the request to be passed.
<P>
If you are using the server as a proxy, the complete request must be
a fully qualified URL pointing to your server.
You must map the URL to a
local file and make sure that the mapping directives allow the URL to be
passed.

<H3><A NAME="HDRALWAY">AlwaysWelcome - Specify if a welcome file is returned for all directory requests</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify if you want your server
to always handle directory requests by first searching the directory
for a welcome file.
<P>
The default value is <TT>On</TT>, which means that the server always
searches the directory for a welcome file.
The Welcome directive specifies the names of the files that
the server recognizes as welcome files.
<P>
If you change the value to <TT>Off</TT>,
the server first checks the last character of directory requests
for the slash (/) character.
If a directory request ends with a slash, the server searches
the directory for a welcome file.
If a directory request does not end with a slash, the server
attempts to return a directory listing.
<P>
If the server does not find a welcome file,
or AlwaysWelcome
is set to Off and the directory request does not end in a slash, the
DirAccess directive controls whether or not the server
responds to the request with a directory listing.
<P><B>Note: </B>Setting AlwaysWelcome to Off does not affect requests that contain
only your server name without a directory name.
The server will always handle these requests by looking in your document
root directory for a welcome file.
The server cannot generate a directory listing for the document
root directory.

Use this directive to specify whether you want your server to return
directory listings when requested.
The values on the
Welcome and AlwaysWelcome directives
determine when a request is interpreted as a request for a directory
listing.
<P>
The default value is <TT>On</TT>, which means
that the server can return directory listings for all directories and
subdirectories.
If you want to control which directories and subdirectories the
server can return directory listings for, use:
<PRE>
   DirAccess   Selective
</PRE>
<P>
If you change the value to <TT>Off</TT>,
the server will not return directory listings.
<P>
If you change the value to
<TT>Selective</TT>, the server will return directory listings for any
directory that contains a file named &#46;www_browsable.
The contents of the &#46;www_browsable file
are not important, the server only checks
for its existence.

Use this directive to specify if
and where you want your server to
display directory listing README files.
<P>
The default value is <TT>Top</TT>, which means that when the server
returns a directory listing, it searches the directory for a file
named README.
If README is found, the server puts the contents of the
file at the top of the directory listing.
<P>
If you change the value to <TT>Bottom</TT>, the server searches for a
README file, but puts the contents at the bottom of the
directory listing.
<P>
If you change the value to <TT>Off</TT>, the server
does not search the directory
for a README file.

AddBlankIcon, AddDirIcon, AddParentIcon, AddUnknownIcon, or AddIcon
directive.
The value you specify on this directive is added to the
<VAR>icon-URL</VAR> value on each of the other directives to form the
full request for the icon.
The full request can be mapped to a file on your server or it can
be a request to another server.
<P><B>Attention:</B>  This directive must be before any of the
other icon directives
(AddBlankIcon, AddDirIcon, AddParentIcon, AddUnknownIcon, and AddIcon).

<H5><A NAME="Header_115">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   IconPath http://icon.server.com&#58;8080/httpd-internal-icons/

In the above example, each request for a directory list icon generates a
request to a server named icon.server.com.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_116">Default:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   IconPath  /icons/
</PRE>
<P>
With the default settings, each request for a directory list icon
generates a request that begins with /icons/.
The server uses its mapping rules to map the request to a local file.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRWELCO">Welcome - Specify names of welcome files</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the name of a welcome file
the server should look for to respond to requests that
do not contain a specific file name.
You can build a list of welcome files
by putting multiple occurrences of this
directive in the configuration file.
<P>
For requests that do not contain a file name or a directory name, the
server always looks in the document root directory for a file that
matches a name specified on a Welcome directive.
If a match is found, the file is returned to the requester.
<P>
For requests that contain a directory name but not a file name,
the AlwaysWelcome directive controls whether the server
looks in the directory for a welcome file to return.
By default, AlwaysWelcome is set to a value of <TT>On</TT>.
This means the server always
looks in the requested directory for a file matching a name specified
on a Welcome directive.
If a match is found, the file is returned to the requester.
<P>
If the server finds more than one match between files in a directory
and file names on Welcome directives,
the order of the Welcome
directives determines which file is returned.
The server uses the Welcome directive closest to the top of the
configuration file.
<P>
If the server does not find a welcome file in the directory, the
DirAccess directive controls whether or not the server
responds to the request with a directory listing.
<P>
The format of the Welcome directive is:
<PRE>
   Welcome   <VAR>file-name</VAR>   &#91;<VAR>IP-address-template</VAR>&#93;
</PRE>
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>file-name</VAR>
<P><DD>
A file name you want to define as being a welcome file.
<P><DT><VAR>IP-address-template</VAR>
<P><DD>
If your server has multiple network connections, you can use this
parameter to specify an address template.
If you use the address template, be sure you do not have any
preceding Welcome directives in your configuration file that
do not have the address template, or your address template will not
be effective.
<P>
The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the server
on a connection with an address matching the template.
It is important to note that it is the address of the
server&#39;s network connection that is compared to the template,
not the address of the requesting client.
<P>
You can specify a complete IP address (for example, 9.67.106.79).
Or, you can
use an asterisk as a wildcard character and specify a template
(for example, 9.83.*).
<P>
This parameter is optional.
Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for all
requests regardless of the network connection the requests come in on.
</DL>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_118">Examples:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   Welcome letsgo.html
   Welcome Welcome.html
</PRE>
<P>
The above example defines two welcome pages and assumes the
AlwaysWelcome directive is set to its default of <TT>On</TT>.
For requests that do not contain a file name, the server would try to
return a welcome file from the directory specified on the request
(or document root directory if the request does not specify a
file name or a directory).
The server would first look for a file named letsgo.html.
If the directory does not have a letsgo.html file, the server would
look for a file named Welcome.html.
<PRE>
   Welcome CustomerA.html  9.67.106.79
   Welcome CustomerB.html  9.83.*
</PRE>
<P>
The above example uses the optional IP address template parameter.
Your server would look for different welcome files based on
the IP address of the network connection the request comes in on.
For requests coming in on 9.67.106.79, the server would look for
welcome files named CustomerA.html.
For requests coming in on any connection with an address beginning 9.83,
the server would look for
welcome files named CustomerB.html.

private Web documents.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRHOMEDIR">HomeDir - Specify the directory that contains user subdirectories</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the name of a
directory on which you want to allow individual users to
have their own subdirectories.
Each user can have a subdirectory off of the directory name you specify.
URL requests to user subdirectories are in the format
&#126;<VAR>username</VAR>.
The server passes these requests to the appropriate user subdirectory
on the HomeDir directory.
<P>
You can use the HomeDir directive either by itself or together
with the UserDir directive.
Whether or not you use UserDir determines how the
server maps URL requests to the user subdirectories.
<P>
If you use HomeDir without UserDir,
all files within the user subdirectories are accessible to clients.
See the description of the UserDir directive
for a description and
example of using HomeDir with UserDir.
<P><B>Note: </B>By using this directive, you are telling the server to process all
requests to user subdirectories.
You do not need to put any additional

<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_122">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   HomeDir  c&#58;\user

c&#58;\user\<VAR>username</VAR> directory.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_123">Default:</A></H5>
None.
By default the server does not accept requests to user subdirectories.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRUSERDIR">UserDir - Specify the name of the accessible subdirectory off of user subdirectories</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the name of a subdirectory
where individual users can keep the files they want to
be accessible to clients of the server.
This directive limits client access to just one subdirectory
within each user subdirectory.
Each individual subdirectory off of the HomeDir directory
can have a subdirectory with the name you specify.
<P>
To use this directive, you must also use the HomeDir
directive.
<P>
An example of why you might want to use this directive is if your
server has access to a LAN server where users have home directories.
You can use this directive to define one subdirectory off of each
user directory where users could keep Web pages they want to be
accessible.

<H5><A NAME="Header_125">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>

Logging and Reporting
<P>
Use the directives described in this section to
control your server&#39;s logs.
You can have the server log incoming requests and server errors.
If your server is running as a caching proxy server, you can log
access requests for files from the proxy server's cache.
<P>
You can specify the path and file
where you want these logs to be kept, how requests should be logged,
and which requests you do not want to log.
<P>
You can view the access, error, and trace logs from the server window.
Although the access log will not write to the server window by default
to ensure better server performance, you can change this by setting the
LogToGUI directive to on.
<P>
You most likely will want to use the common log format.
This is the default format and it is the same format
used by most other types of Web servers.
If you plan to use the access log report function, you are required to
use the common log format.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRACCLOG">AccessLog - Name the path for the access log file</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the path and file name
where you want the server to log access statistics.
By default, the server writes an entry to this log each time
a client sends the server a request.
You can use the NoLog directive if you do not want
to log requests from certain clients.
For a description of the NoLog directive, refer to 
<A HREF="#HDRNOLOG">"NoLog - Suppress log entries for specific hosts or domains matching a template"</A>.
<P>
The server starts a new log file each day at midnight if it is running.
Otherwise, the server starts a new log file
the first time you start it on a given day.
When creating the file, the
server uses the file name you specify and appends a date extension.
The date extension is in the format <VAR>Mmmddyy</VAR>, where <VAR>Mmm</VAR>
is the first three letters of the month; <VAR>dd</VAR> is the day of the
month; and <VAR>yy</VAR> is the last two digits of the year.
<P>
It is a good idea to remove old log files, because they can take
up a significant amount of space on your hard drive.
For information about removing old log files, refer to
<A HREF="#HDRACCLOGA">"AccessLogArchive - Remove existing access log files or run a user exit"</A>.

and creates a new access log file for the coming day.
You can choose to do one of the following actions with the closed
access logs:
<UL>
<P><LI>Remove access log files
of a given age or when a given amount of storage

<H3><A NAME="HDRCACLOG">CacheAccessLog - Specify the path for the cache access log files</A></H3>
If the server is running as a proxy, you can log requests to the
cache separately from other requests.  Use the CacheAccessLog directive
to specify the path and file name where you want the server to put
access requests for cached files.
To enable logging of requests to the proxy cache, the following
directives must be defined:
<UL>
<P><LI>Caching must be turned ON (default is OFF)
<P><LI>CacheRoot (by default, no CacheRoot is defined)
<P><LI>CacheAccessLog
</UL>
<P>The value of CacheAccessLog can either be an absolute path or a path
relative to ServerRoot (one example shown of each).
<P><B>Note: </B>If you choose to use CacheAccessLog, access requests for cached
files are logged, but they are not included in the access
reports.
Access reports contain only information from
access logs, not from cache access logs.
Therefore, if you want access reports to contain access requests
for cached files, do <I>not</I> specify the CacheAccessLog directive.
<P>
The server starts a new log file each day at midnight if it is running.
Otherwise, the server starts a new log file
the first time you start it on a given day.

The date extension is in the format <VAR>Mmmddyy</VAR>, where <VAR>Mmm</VAR>
is the first three letters of the month; <VAR>dd</VAR> is the day of the
month; and <VAR>yy</VAR> is the last two digits of the year.
<P><B>Note: </B>It is a good idea to occasionally check the path that contains your
log files.
If your server has a large amount of activity, your log files could grow
to the point that they cause your server to run out of disk space.
Make sure the files are not taking up too much space and
delete the log files you no longer need.

<H2><A NAME="HDRMAPPI" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_263">Resource mapping - Redirect URLs and define file extensions</A></H2>
Resource mapping
<P>
Use the directives described in this section to
control
how your server interprets particular file extensions,
which requests your server accepts, and where the server looks
for resources.
<P>
The server binds files to a content type, content encoding,
or content language based on the file extension.
The server provides defaults for most
commonly used extensions.
Use the extension definition directives only if you need
to add new definitions or change the default definitions.
<P>
Use the mapping directives (Exec, Fail, Map,
Pass, and Redirect) to control which
requests your server accepts and to
map URL requests to your actual files.
<P>
You can use the mapping directives to create a virtual hierarchy of
Web resources.
You can then change the
physical location of files or directories without
affecting the virtual layout.
Even if your server sends
documents from different file
systems, it can present a virtual layout.
<P>
The server applies the mapping directives in the order they appear in the
configuration file until a request has been accepted, rejected,
or there are no more directives that apply to the request.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRADDENCD">AddEncoding - Specify the MIME content encoding of files with particular extensions</A></H3>

</PRE>
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>.extension</VAR>
<P><DD>The file extension pattern.

</PRE>
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>.extension</VAR>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRADDTYPE">AddType - Specify the data type of files with particular extensions</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to bind files with a particular extension
to a MIME type/subtype.
You can have
multiple occurrences of this directive in your configuration file.
The server provides defaults for most commonly used extensions.
The format of the directive is:
<PRE>
   AddType <VAR>.extension type/subtype encoding</VAR> &#91;<VAR>quality</VAR>&#91; <VAR>character-set</VAR>&#93;&#93;
</PRE>
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>.extension</VAR>
<P><DD>The file extension pattern.
You can use the wildcard character (*) only on the following two
special extension patterns:
<DL>
<P><DT><B>*.*
</B><DD>Matches all file names that contain a dot character (.)
and have not been matched by other rules
<P><DT><B>*
</B><DD>Matches all file names that do not contain a dot character (.)
and have not been matched by other rules
</DL>
<P><DT><VAR>type/subtype</VAR>
<P><DD>The MIME type subtype you want to bind to files that match the
corresponding extension pattern.
<P><DT><VAR>encoding</VAR>
<P><DD>The MIME content-encoding format to which the
data has been converted.
In most cases, the appropriate encoding is 7-bit, 8-bit, or binary,
and is determined as follows:
<DL>
<P><DT><B>7-bit
</B><DD>Data is all represented as short (less than 1000
characters) lines of US-ASCII data. Source code or plain text files
usually fall into this category. Exceptions would be files containing
line-drawing characters or accented characters.
<P><DT><B>8-bit
</B><DD>Data is represented as short lines, but may
contain characters with the high bit set (for example, line-drawing
characters or accented characters).
PostScript files and text files
from European sites usually fall into this category.
<P><DT><B>binary
</B><DD>This encoding can be used for all data types.
Data may contain not only non-ASCII characters, but also long
(greater than 1000 characters) lines.  Almost every file of type
image/*, audio/*, and video/* falls into this category, as do binary
data files of type application/*.
</DL>
<P>Any other value of encoding receives the same treatment as
binary and is passed in MIME headers as a content encoding
MIME header.  EBCDIC, 7-bit, and 8-bit is not sent in MIME
headers.
<P><DT><VAR>quality</VAR>
<P><DD>An optional indicator of relative value
(on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0)
for the content type.
The quality value is used if multiple
representations of a file are matched by a request.
The server selects the file that is
associated with the highest quality value.
For example, if the file
internet.ps is requested, and the server has the
following AddType directives:
<PRE>
   AddType   .ps application/postscript   8bit   1.0
   AddType   *.* application/binary       binary 0.3
</PRE>
<P>
the server would use the application/postscript line because its
quality number is higher.
<P><DT><VAR>character-set</VAR>
<P><DD>An optional indicator of the
character set you want to
associate with text documents.
For the documents that you assign a character set to,
the server tells client browsers what character set to use when
displaying the document.
If you want to use the character-set field, you must also include a
value for the quality field.

<H3><A NAME="HDREXEC">Exec - Run a CGI program for matching requests</A></H3>
<P>
<P>
Use this directive to specify a template for requests you want
to accept and respond to by running a CGI program.
Once a request matches a template on an Exec directive, the request
is not compared to request templates on any subsequent directives.
<P>
The format of the directive is:
<PRE>
   Exec   <VAR>request-template</VAR>   <VAR>program-path</VAR>   &#91;<VAR>IP-address-template</VAR>&#93;
</PRE>
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>request-template</VAR>
<P><DD>
A template for requests that you want your server to accept and
respond to by running a CGI program.
<P>
You must use an asterisk as a wildcard in both the
<VAR>request-template</VAR> and <VAR>program-path</VAR>.
The part of the
request that matches the
<VAR>request-template</VAR> wildcard must begin with the name of the
file that contains the CGI program.
<P><DT><VAR>program-path</VAR>
<P><DD>
The path to the file that contains the
CGI program you want the server to execute
for the request.
<P>
<VAR>program-path</VAR>
must also contain a wildcard.
The wildcard is replaced with the name of the file that contains
the CGI program.
The request can also contain additional data
that is passed to the CGI program in the
PATH_INFO environment variable.
The additional data follows the first slash character that comes
after the CGI program file name on the request.
The data is passed according to CGI specifications.
<P><DT><VAR>IP-address-template</VAR>
<P><DD>
If your server has multiple network connections, you can use this
parameter to specify an address template.
The server uses the directive only for requests that come to the server
on a connection with an address matching the template.
It is important to note that it is the address of the
server&#39;s network connection that is compared to the template,
not the address of the requesting client.
<P>
You can specify a complete IP address (for example, 9.67.106.79).
Or, you can
use an asterisk as a wildcard character and specify a template
(for example, 9.83.*).
<P>
This parameter is optional.
Without this parameter, the server uses the directive for all
requests regardless of the network connection the requests come in on.

The above example uses the optional IP address template parameter.
If your server receives requests that begin with
/cgi-bin/, it serves the request from a different directory based on
the IP address of the network connection the request comes in on.
For requests coming in on 9.67.106.79, the server uses the

Use this directive to customize the messages your server sends to
the requesting
client when it encounters an error condition.  For example,
you can change a message to include
more information about the cause of the problem and
suggest possible solutions to fix it.
For internal networks, you might provide
a contact person for your users to call.
<P>Each error condition is identified by a key word.  To decide
which error messages you want to customize, first

the server sends.
Then, for each error message you want to change:
<UL>
<P><LI>Create an individual HTML file with the desired text.
<P><LI>Add an <STRONG>ErrorPage</STRONG> directive to your configuration file
that associates the error

the file you want to send
must be in a location that can be reached through the mapping rules
as defined by the

The client can connect to the
correct server or display the message that is sent.
<P>Default message:
Found.
<P><DT><B>400 badrequest

Either there is a network problem, such as a time-out, or the request
was indecipherable.
<P>Default message:
Invalid request - completely unable to parse it.
<P><DT><B>400 badscript
</B><DD>Cause:
The server could determine that the requested file was a CGI script but
it could not process it;
the request was invalid in some way.
<P>Default message:
The script execution request is not valid.
<P><DT><B>400 proxyfail
</B><DD>Cause:
The client is trying to use the server as a proxy, and although this
is allowed, it did not work.  Possibly the destination server doesn't
exist or is busy.
<P>Default message:
Proxy load failed.
<P><DT><B>400 shttperror
</B><DD>Cause:
The document is protected by Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP)
and all the conditions have not been met.
Often the problem has to do with the CRYPTOPTS.
<P>Default message:
An SHTTP error occurred.
<P><DT><B>400 unknownmethod
</B><DD>Cause:
The request did not include a recognized method, such as GET, POST, PUT,
or DELETE.
<P>Default message:
The request is not valid or not recognized.
<P><DT><B>401 notauthorized
</B><DD>Cause:
The request requires a
user name and password.  Either the user name
and password sent by the client are not valid for this request or
the client did not send a user name and password.
<P>Default message:
Not Authorized.  Authentication failed.
<P><DT><B>401 notmember
</B><DD>Cause:
The requested file has a protection rule listing
valid user names and passwords
and the user name of the requesting client is not included in that list.
<P>Default message:
Not authorized to access the document.
<P><DT><B>403 baduser
</B><DD>Cause:
The client requested a user's home directory that does not exist.
<P>Default message:
The user directory is not valid.
<P><DT><B>403 badredirect
</B><DD>Cause:
The server is trying to redirect the request and the

(possibly missing a destination) or contains a loop.
<P>Default message:
The redirection in the configuration file is not valid.
<P><DT><B>403 byrule
</B><DD>Cause:
Either the
file requested is specifically blocked by a <STRONG>Fail</STRONG> directive
or it does not match any of the files that are allowed to be accessed
according to other request mapping directives.
<P>Default message:
Forbidden by rule.
<P><DT><B>403 dirbrowse
</B><DD>Cause:
The client specified a directory (rather than a file name) in the URL
that does not have a welcome page and the administrator
has turned off directory browsing (either for this directory or for
the entire server).
<P>Default message:
Directory browsing failed - access forbidden.
<P><DT><B>403 dotdot
</B><DD>Cause:
The client request contains an instruction (/../) to
navigate above the document directory root and this is not allowed.
<P>Default message:
Forbidden - URL containing .. forbidden
(don't try to break in).
<P><DT><B>403 ipmask
</B><DD>Cause:
The file requested has a protection rule that includes a list of
valid IP addresses and the client's address is not included in the list.
<P>Default message:
Server will not serve to your IP address.
<P><DT><B>403 ipmaskproxy
</B><DD>Cause:
The client is trying to use the server as a proxy and the client
is not included in the list of host names or IP addresses that are
allowed to do so.
<P>Default message:
Proxy server will not serve to your IP address
(at least with this HTTP method).
<P><DT><B>403 methoddisabled
</B><DD>Cause:
The client requested a method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that is
specifically not allowed by the Disable directive.
<P>Default message:
Method <VAR>method</VAR> is disabled on this server.
<P><DT><B>403 noacl
</B><DD>Cause:
The directory has a protection rule but does not have an Access Control
List (ACL) defined and the protection setup does not have a GetMask
subdirective.
The administrator needs to remove the protection rule or add an ACL.
<P>Default message:
Access to this file is not allowed &#39;no ACL file&#39;.
<P><DT><B>403 noentry
</B><DD>Cause:
The directory is protected by an Access Control List
(ACL) and the user is not included in the ACL.
<P>Default message:
Access to this file is not allowed (no ACL entry).
<P><DT><B>403 notallowed
</B><DD>Cause:
The requested file was found but the server's protection setup prevented
access.  This is commonly generated for URLs that point to CGI programs.
<P>Default message:
The PUT and DELETE methods must be specified in the server's protection
setup.
<P><DT><B>403 openfailed
</B><DD>Cause:
After passing the protection rules, the server determined that
the client
should have read access to the file but the operating system will not

Methods
<P>
Use the directives described in this section to
control which HTTP methods are enabled for your server.
<P>
Client requests to the server include a method field that indicates
the action
the server is to perform on the specified object.
The request identifies the
object with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
<P>
Following is a list of methods that the server
supports
and a description of how the server would respond to a client request
containing the method.
The description assumes the method is enabled.
<UL>
<P><LI>
CHECKIN - The server processes this method the same as the PUT method.
<P><LI>
CHECKOUT - The server processes this method the same as the GET method.
<P><LI>DELETE -
For your server to use this method, you must use the
DELETE-Script directive to specify a program to process delete requests
(see 
<A HREF="#HDRACSCR">"Accessory scripts - Specify custom method scripts"</A>).
The program you use determines how the server handles these requests.
Because delete programs typically let
clients delete information from your server,
you must use protection setups
to define who can use this method for which files
(see 
<A HREF="icswg008.html#HDRPRT">"Protecting your server"</A>).
<P><LI>GET - The server
returns whatever data is identified by the URL.
If the
URL refers to an executable program,  the server returns the output
of the program.
<P><LI>HEAD - The server
returns only HTTP document headers without the
document body.
<P><LI>POST - The request
contains data and a URL.
The server creates a new object with the data portion of the request.
The server links the new object to the URL sent on the request.
The server gives the new object a URL.
The server sends the URL of the new object back to
the client.
The new object  is subordinate to the URL contained on
the request (the same way a file is subordinate to a directory or a
news article is subordinate to a news group).
POST creates new documents; use PUT to replace existing data.
<P><B>Note: </B>The POST method is commonly used to process HTML forms.
For example, the
Configuration and Administration forms use the POST
method.
<P><LI>PUT -
For your server to use this method, you must use the
PUT-Script directive to specify a program to process put requests
(see 
<A HREF="#HDRACSCR">"Accessory scripts - Specify custom method scripts"</A>).
The program you use determines how the server handles these requests.
Because put programs typically let
clients add or replace information on your server,
you must use protection setups
to define who can use this method for which files
(see 
<A HREF="icswg008.html#HDRPRT">"Protecting your server"</A>).
</UL>
<P>

To disable a method that is currently enabled,
change the Enable directive for the

Accessory scripts
<P>
Use the directives described in this section to
specify default script programs to process
SEARCH, POST, PUT, or DELETE requests.
Requests are first matched
against the configuration file&#39;s mapping rules.
If the request does not
explicitly map to a CGI script program on an EXEC directive,

<P>
You must enable the HTTP DELETE method for the server to be able to
process delete requests (see 
<A HREF="#HDRMETHO">"Methods - Set method acceptance"</A>).
Because the DELETE
method lets clients delete information from your server, you must use
protection rules to define who you want

Meta-Information
<P>
Use the directives described in this section to
control where your server looks for meta-information files.
<P>
You can use a separate set of files to store meta-information about your
server&#39;s documents.
The server can include the meta-information with its
HTTP responses.
Meta-information describes the file containing a
document, not the contents of the document.
For example, meta-information for a
file might give the date the file was created and the date it
was last modified.
<P>
HTTP recognizes Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) headers.
Information that MIME header fields can identify include the file type,
subtype, encoding, and content length.
<P>
Each line of a meta-information file contains a header field,
followed by a
colon, and the value of the field.  For example:
<PRE>
   Last-Modified: Wednesday, 05-Apr-96 20&#58;51&#58;35 GMT
   Expires-by: Friday, 30-Jun-96 24&#58;00&#58;00 GMT

</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRMETADIR">MetaDir - Specify name of subdirectory for meta-information files</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the name you want to use for
subdirectories that contain meta-information files.
You can only have one instance of this directive, which means all
your meta-information subdirectories have the same name.
<P>
Any directory from which your
server retrieves files can have
a subdirectory with the name specified on this directive.
The files on the meta-information subdirectory contain meta-information
about the files being retrieved.
The meta-information files have the same
file name and extension as the file they describe, plus an added
extension.
The name of the added extension is specified on the
MetaSuffix directive.
<P>
For example, you might have the following two directives in your
configuration file:
<PRE>
   MetaDir     look_here
   MetaSuffix  &#46;file_desc
</PRE>
If your server goes to retrieve this file:
<PRE>
   d:/html/realcool/coolindex.html
</PRE>
it looks for meta information to include with the response in this file:
<PRE>
   d:/html/realcool/look_here/coolindex.html.file_desc

<H3><A NAME="HDRMETASUF">MetaSuffix - Specify the extension for meta-information files</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the extension you want to use for
meta-information files.
You can only have one instance of this directive, which means all
meta-information files end with the same extension.
You must include the period character (&#46;) as part of the
value.
<P>
Any file your server retrieves can have a meta-information file
associated with it.
A meta-information file has the same
file name and extension as the file it describes, plus the additional
extension specified on the MetaSuffix directive.
A meta-information file must be located
on a subdirectory of the directory that contains the file being
described.
The name of the subdirectory must be the name
specified on the MetaDir directive.
<P>
See the description of the MetaDir directive to see an
example of how MetaDir and MetaSuffix work
together.

ICAPI application processing
<P>The Internet Connection Application Programming Interface
(ICAPI) allows you to extend the Internet Connection Server's base functions with your
own customized processing routines.
Use the directives described in this section to have the server call
the application functions in your
program at various points in its request processing cycle.
You can find
detailed information for writing the application functions and compiling
your program in the <CITE>Web Programming Guide</CITE>.
<P>Except for Service and NameTrans,
these directives can be in any order in the configuration file
and you do not need to include every one.  If you do not have a
customized application function for a particular step, just omit
the corresponding directive.  The normal processing for that step will
execute by default.
<P>The Service and NameTrans directives behave like the other mapping
directives and are sensitive to their placement in the configuration
file.
For example a rule for <TT>/cgi-bin/foo.dll</TT> must appear
before the rule for <TT>/cgi-bin/*</TT>.
<P>You can also have more than one configuration directive for a step.
For example, you could include two NameTrans directives, each pointing
to a different application function.  When the server performs the name
translation step, it will process your name translation functions in
the order in which they appear within the configuration file.
<P>Your application functions do not have to be executed for every
request:
<UL>
<P><LI>
By specifying a URL with some directives, you can indicate that you
want the application function called only for URLs that match a
certain pattern or mask.

By specifying an authentication scheme with
the Authentication directive, you can indicate that you want the

HTTP servers usually give the Last-Modified time for a file,
but not the Expires date.
Use this directive to have your server approximate the
expiration date of these files based on the Last-Modified time.
The server
uses the Last-Modified date to determine how long
it has been since the file
was modified.
The server multiplies that length of time by the value on the
CacheLastModifiedFactor directive.

result of this calculation to assign the file an expiration date
when it caches
the file.

If you have enabled caching, the server uses the garbage collection
process to delete
files that should no longer be cached.
Files are deleted based on their
expiration date and other proxy directive values.
Use this directive to turn
garbage collection on or off.
Generally, you would not turn off garbage
collection if you have enabled caching.
If you do, your cache file
could grow
beyond the maximum size you set for it.
<P>
Assuming garbage collection is turned on, the garbage collection process
runs when the cache reaches its maximum size (as specified on the
CacheSize directive).
The garbage collection process will also
run at the time of day specified on the GcDailyGc directive.

<H3><A NAME="HDRGCDAILY">GcDailyGc - Specify a daily time for garbage collection</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify a particular time of day to run the garbage
collection process.
Garbage collection occurs automatically when the cache
size limit is reached.
By specifying a daily time for garbage collection you
can also remove cached files before the cache reaches its maximum.
Specify
the time value in 24&#58;00 hour format.
Generally, you would want the garbage
collection process to run when your server is not being used
much for other

<H3><A NAME="HDRGCMEMUS">GcMemUsage - Specify how much memory to use for garbage collection</A></H3>
<P>
Garbage collection works best if it can read all cache information into
memory at one time.
It may not be able to read in the entire cache if your
system does not have enough main memory.
<P>
Use this directive to specify how much memory garbage collection can use.
The value you specify should be approximately the amount of virtual
memory that the server may use while performing garbage collection.
The amount of memory needed will vary based on dynamic
changes such as the
directory structure of cached files.
Specify the value as a number that
represents kilobytes, but do not put a K next to the number.
<P>
If garbage collection fails because there is not enough memory on your
system, set this directive to a smaller value.
If you have plenty of memory to
spare, you may want to set this value above the default of 500.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_423">Example:</A></H5>

<H3><A NAME="HDRMAXCLBU">MaxContentLengthBuffer - Set the size of the buffer for files retrieved from another server</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to
set the size of the buffer.
For each proxy request, the server allocates a buffer up to the
size you specify on this directive.
If the file being retrieved is larger than the buffer, the
server sends it to the client without a Content Length header.
Specify the
buffer size in kilobytes (K) or megabytes (M).

<H3><A NAME="HDRNOPROXY">no_proxy - Connect directly to domains matching templates</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the
domains that you want the server to directly connect to
rather than going through a proxy.
<P>
Specify the value as a string of domain names or domain name templates.
Separate each entry in the string with a comma.
Do <B>not</B> put any spaces in the string.
<P>
You specify templates on this directive a bit differently than
the way you specify templates on other directives.
Most importantly, you <B>cannot</B> use the wildcard character (*).
What you <B>can</B> do is specify a template by including only
the last part of a domain name.
The server connects directly to any domains that
end with a string matching the templates you specify.
The following example shows how this works.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_435">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   no_proxy   www.someco.com,.raleigh.ibm.com,.some.host.org&#58;8080

Performance settings
<P>
Use the directives described in this section to
control the performance of your server.
<P>
Use the
MinActiveThreads, MaxActiveThreads, and
IdleThreadTimeout directives to specify your server&#39;s
pool of available threads.
By having a pool of threads
available to your server,
you can reduce the number of times
your server needs to start and close new threads.
<P>
Each time your server receives a request from a client, it uses
one or two threads to perform the requested action.
(One thread if the server is not performing DNS lookup.
Two threads if the server is performing DNS lookup.)
The server first checks to see if any threads are available.
If so, the server uses available threads to process the request.
If no threads are available and the maximum number of active threads
has not been reached, the server starts new threads to process the
request.
If the maximum number of active threads has been reached,
the server holds the request until threads become available.
When a request finishes, the threads it was using become idle.
As long as idle threads do not expire, they are available for the server
to use again.
<P>
If your server is running at maximum capacity on a
sustained, non-stop basis, you may experience slow growth of the swapper
file on your machine.
This swapper growth is temporary and is alleviated when the number
of requests to the server decreases, allowing the server to catch up
on servicing requests.
<P>
This growth of the swapper file is an indication that the Maximum
Active Threads directive may be set too high for your machine.
We suggest that you experiment with lowering the number of Maximum
Active Threads until you reach a point of no growth of your
swapper file.
A good starting point would be half of the previous setting.
For example, if you had Maximum Active Threads set to 40,
try setting it to 20.
You may need to lower it even further.
<P><B>Note: </B><BLOCKQUOTE>
Lowering Maximum Active Threads may result in increased
numbers of rejected connections when the Internet Connection Server
reaches capacity.
Increasing the number of Maximum Active Threads will
decrease the number of rejected connections when the Internet Connection
Server reaches capacity, but it will result in an increased rate of
swapper file growth.
You may need to decide how you want to balance
ability to service sustained large numbers of requests with ability to
tolerate swapper growth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Use the ServerPriority directive to specify the priority
your operating system gives to the server.
<P>If you see a problem with your performance with your server
being too slow, it could be related to any of the following:
<UL>
<P><LI>Your token ring speed
<P><LI>The traffic on your LAN
<P><LI>The number of clients requesting from your server
<P><LI>The number of threads set on your server
</UL>
<P>
Use the CacheLocalFile directive to load your most popular
files into the servers memory at startup time.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRCACHLOF">CacheLocalFile - Specify files you want to load in memory at start up</A></H3>
<P>
Use this directive to specify the names of files you want to load
into the server&#39;s memory each time you start the server.
You can have multiple occurrences of this directive in the
configuration file.
Include a separate directive for each file you want to load into memory.
<P>
By keeping your most
frequently requested files loaded in the server&#39;s memory, you
can improve your server&#39;s response time for those files.
For example, if you load your server&#39;s welcome page into memory
at startup, the server can handle requests for the page much more
quickly than if it had to read the file from a disk.
Keep in mind that for each file you load into memory, you are
making that amount of memory unavailable for other uses.
<P>
Before responding to a request for a file that is stored
in memory, the server
checks to see if the file has changed since the server was started.
If the file has changed,
the server responds to the request with the updated file and deletes the
old version from its memory.
To load the new file into memory, you need to restart the server.
<P><B>Notes: </B><OL>
<P><LI>You must specify a fully qualified file name on each directive.
<P><LI>You cannot use wildcard characters on the file names.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRIDLTHTO">IdleThreadTimeout - Specify length of time to keep idle threads available</A></H3>
<P>Use this directive to specify how long the server should keep an
idle thread available.
A thread becomes idle after the last request to use it
completes.
If the
number of threads already available or active is greater than the
value on MinActiveThreads and the server does not use
the thread again within the specified time, the server closes the idle
thread.

Specify the time value in any combination of hours, minutes
(or mins), and seconds (or secs).
If you use the default value of <TT>forever</TT>,
the server does not close any idle threads.

If the maximum is reached, the server holds new requests until
another request finishes and threads become available.
Generally, the more power
your machine has,
the higher the value you should use for this directive.
If your machine starts to spend too much time on overhead tasks, such

<P>
The server creates two types of logs:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Access logs
<LI>Error logs
</UL>
<P>
The server logs activity in the
<B><I>access log</I></B> files and stores them
on the hard drive nightly.
At midnight each night, the server closes the current access log and
creates a new access log file for the coming day.
The access log contains
entries for each attempt to get to a page.
<P>
For each access request your server receives, an
entry is made in the access log showing:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>What was requested
<LI>When it was requested
<LI>Who requested it
<LI>The method of the request
<LI>The type of file that your
server sent in response to the request
<LI>The return code, which indicates
whether the request was honored.
</UL>
<P>
Each day at midnight,
the server creates a new access log and <B><I>error log</I></B> that
includes errors encountered by your server's
clients, such as timing out or not
getting access.
<P>If your server is running as a proxy, the server can create two
different types of logs:
<UL>
<P><LI>A <B><I>proxy access log</I></B>,
which contains access requests for files that
come from the proxy server
<P><LI>A <B><I>cache access log</I></B>,
which contains access requests for files that come
from the proxy server's cache.
</UL>
<P>
This section describes how to set up the access,
error, and cache access logs to suit your particular needs.
If you are satisfied with the default setting for an option, you can
skip the step.

<P>
To improve your ability to use the information included in the access log
files, you can filter out extraneous information so that the log includes
only information that is meaningful to you.
You filter out information by excluding
entries that match a particular pattern.
We recommend you define these options on the
Access Log File Configuration form, but you can edit
the configuration file to include the appropriate directives
for the filters you want to set.
You can specify filters based on any of the following:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>URL (directories and/or files)
<LI>IP address or host name
<LI>Method
<LI>Mime type
<LI>Return code
</UL>
<P><B>Note: </B>Keep in mind that information filtered out from the access log,
will not show up in any access report and will not be available for
future use.
<P>
Here are some examples of why you might want to control what
gets logged.
<P>
<B>To reduce the size of the logs:</B>
You might be interested in reducing the number of entries in an
access log to include only meaningful access requests.
Access log files can grow rapidly, since by default they contain entries
for all access requests for GIF images, HTML pages, and so on.
You might want to configure your access logs so that they include
log entries for access requests to HTML pages, but not for the
access requests for the GIF images that the HTML contains.
For example, an HTML page might include several GIF images,
which can cause the size of the access log to grow rapidly.
<P>
<B>To collect information about external hits only:</B>
You might be interested only in who is accessing your server from
outside your company.
In this case, you would filter out access requests that originate
from internal
company IP addresses.

<H3><A NAME="HDRSPPRXL">Specify the path for the proxy server's cache access log</A></H3>
If the server is running as a proxy, you can log requests to the cache
separately from other requests.
<P>
From the Access Log File Configuration form,
you can specify the path and
file name where you want the server to put access requests that
are satisfied from the proxy server's cache.
<P>For more information, refer to 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRCACLOG">"CacheAccessLog - Specify the path for the cache access log files"</A>.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_491">Directives to use</A></H5>
<P>For the cache access
log path, use the CacheAccessLog directive, in
addition to those described under 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRCACLOG">"CacheAccessLog - Specify the path for the cache access log files"</A>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRUNDEREP" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_492">Understanding the reports your server creates</A></H2>
<P>
Your server creates reports that include some or all of the
contents of the access logs.
At midnight each night, the server closes the current access log and
creates a new access log file for the coming day.
Reports are generated at that time using the access log that was just
closed.
<P><B>Note: </B>If you have specified the CacheAccessLog directive or if you
have indicated on the Access Log File Configuration form a path
and file name for the proxy server's cache
access log, your reports <I>will not
</I> contain access requests for cached files.
If you do not have a cache access log, access requests
for a proxy server are logged in the access log and can be included
in an access report.
<P>
By default, your server creates a report template that shows
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>The top 50 most frequently visited URLs on your server
<LI>The top 50 most frequent visitors to your Web site.
</UL>
<P>For each report template, your server creates a daily, weekly,
monthly, and yearly report.
The weekly, monthly, and yearly reports include "to-date"
information.
For example, if you look at the monthly report for April and the date
is April 15, the report includes entries for April 1 through April 14.
<P>You have control over what is
included in reports created from log files.
You can
filter out entries that match a particular pattern.
These options are defined either by using the
Configuration and Administration
forms or by editing the configuration file.
You can use the forms or the configuration file to
specify filters based on any of the following:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>URL (directories and files)
<LI>IP address or host name
<LI>Method
<LI>Return code
</UL>
<P>
The contents of the report are governed by the following factors:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>The log file
filters that were in effect when the log file was created
<LI>The report filters that are in effect when the report is created.
</UL>
<P>
At report creation time, you control only the report
filters that are currently in effect.
You cannot include in the report entries that were filtered out from
the log file.
<P>
You can specify report filters in two ways; you must decide which
is easier in your situation.
<P>
If you want to include in your report
only a small percentage of the contents of the access log,
it might be simplest to specify what to <B><I>include</I></B>, rather than
everything you want to exclude.
Think of specifying one or a few include filters as a shortcut
to specifying many exclude filters.
<P>
If you want to include in your report
most of the contents of the access log,
it might be simplest to specify what to <B><I>exclude</I></B>, rather than
everything you want to include.
<P>
In some cases, you will find it simplest to specify both include and
exclude filters.
In this case, it is important to understand how include and exclude
filters work together.
The include filters are processed first.
The report function searches the access log to find all entries that
match any include filter patterns.
If several include filters are specified, the filters act as OR Boolean
expressions.
In other words, entries that match at least one of the include
filters are included.
<P>
The exclude filters are processed after all include filters have been
processed.
The exclude filters work only on the set of entries that have been
already included by the include filters.
For clarification, refer to the examples under 
<A HREF="#HDRSCENREP">"Sample scenarios for configuring reports"</A>.
<P>
The include and exclude filters are specified on the
Access Log Report Template Creation form or can be specified with
the AccessReport directives.
<P>
Here are some examples of why you might want to control what
gets reported.
<P>
<B>To reduce the scope of the report:</B>
You might be interested in reducing the scope of the report so that
it includes only a portion of what is contained in the log.
You can even create several reports, each to gather different
information from the same log.
You might want to create your report template so that it includes
log entries for access requests to HTML pages, but not for the
access requests for the GIF images that the HTML contains.
<P>
<B>To collect information about external hits only:</B>
You might be interested only in who is accessing your server from
outside your company.
In this case, you would filter out access requests that originate
from internal
company IP addresses.
<P>
<B>To gather information about who is accessing a particular
Web site:</B>
To help you determine the size of the audience for a particular
Web site, you might want to create a report that shows only the hits
to one URL.
<P>
<B>To discover the top Web pages on your server:</B>
To help you determine the popularity of a particular Web site, you
filter out everything in the report, except for the most visited
Web pages.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_493">View default report templates</A></H3>

from the Configuration and Administration Form page,
choose <B>Access reports</B>.
A list of the existing reports is displayed.
By clicking on any report, you can see the report and
print it from your Web browser.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_494">Update a report template</A></H3>
<P>
Before you create a report, you must modify or create a report template
that outlines what you want the report to contain.
To start configuring a report template, choose one of the following
options from the Access Log Report Templates form:
<UL>
<P><LI>
If you have never created a report before, or if you want to create
a report that is very different from your existing reports,
choose <B>Create a new template</B>.
<P>If you are making a new report, it might be easier to copy an
existing template and edit the copy, rather than creating a new
template.
<P><LI>To use an existing report template as the basis of a new
report, choose
<B>Copy existing template</B>.
<P><LI>To update an existing report template, choose
<B>Edit existing template</B>.
<P><LI>To delete an existing report template, choose
<B>Delete existing template</B>.
</UL>
When you choose <B>Create a new template</B> or <B>Edit existing
template</B>, the
Access Log Report Template Creation form appears.
<P>When you have finished filling in the form, choose <B>Apply</B>.
<P>
On this form, you can specify some or all of the following:
<UL>
<P><LI>Basic settings, such as the report name, description, and
the number of entries to include in the report (for example, the
top 10.)
<P><LI>Entries from the access log that you want to exclude from the
report (based on directories and file names, host names or IP addresses,
methods, or return codes.)
<P><LI>Entries from the access log that you want to include (as a
shortcut to many excludes.)
</UL>
<P>
Specifying entries to include is a shortcut to specifying many,
many excludes.
When you want to include only a few types of entries in the report,
it is easier to specify what to include rather than excluding
everything but the types of entries you want to include.
For example, if you want to include only access requests for a
particular URL, you would include that URL, rather than excluding
all the others.
<P>
The Access Log Report Template Creation form
allows you to specify includes
and excludes.
It is important to understand how includes and excludes affect each
other.
<UL>
<P><LI>In the index list, if nothing is listed with a Filter Action of
"Include", the entire log is included in the report, minus the
entries that are excluded.
<P><LI>If anything is listed with a Filter Action of "Include",
the report will contain only the information that is to be
included, minus the entries that are excluded.
</UL>
<P>
If you are using the Access Log Report Templates form,
you see at the bottom of the form the field <B>Report root
directory</B>.
This field is filled in with a default directory.
We recommend that you accept the default, rather than changing it.
If you choose to change the default, you will need to create a new
directory for the path you specify, give the directory the
appropriate permissions and add a PASS statement to enable the server
to honor requests to store access logs in that directory.

<H1><A NAME="HDRSSI" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_508">Using server-side includes</A></H1>
<P>This chapter contains information about server-side
includes.  It describes the command format and
how to use the commands needed
to make server-side includes work in your HTML documents and
CGI programs.
See 
<A HREF="icswg011.html#HDRDTUSSI">"3. Decide whether to use server-side includes"</A> for information about security
server-side includes.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRSSICON" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_509">Considerations for using server-side includes</A></H2>
Before using server-side includes on your
server, there are a few issues you should consider.
One issue is performance.  Performance can be
significantly impacted when the server is processing file
while sending them.
Another issue is security.  Letting ordinary
users execute commands can be a security risk.
Be very careful when deciding which directories you use
server-side includes in and which directories you use the
<TT>exec</TT> command in.
You can minimize the security risk if you do not enable the
<TT>exec</TT> command.
<P>
You should also note that you cannot reference
files recursively.
For example, if you are running file <TT>sleepy.html</TT>
and the program finds
&cont.<TT><--!#include file="sleepy.html" --></TT>
the server doesn't detect the error and the server loops until
the server abends.
However, you can reference files within files.
For example, file <TT>sleepy.html</TT> references
file <TT>smiley.html</TT> and file <TT>smiley.html</TT>
references <TT>dopey.html</TT>.
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRSSSET" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_510">Preparing to use server-side includes</A></H2>
<P>To use server-side includes, you need to add the
AddType directive to your configuration file.  Two
examples follow:
<P>
<B><I>Examples</I></B>&#58;
<PRE>
   AddType .shtml text/x-ssi-html 8 bit 1.0
   AddType .htmls text/x-ssi-html 8 bit 1.0
</PRE>
<P><B>Note: </B>If you use file extensions other than .shtml or .htmls, you
should check the AddType directive to see if that extension
already exists.  See the configuration file, appendix listing,
or the MIME form for a list of existing AddType directives.
<P>You can also use the imbeds directive to specify
whether server-side includes can be used in HTML documents,
CGI programs, or both.  Examples of this directive follow&#58;
<P>
<B><I>Examples</I></B>&#58;
<PRE>
   imbeds <VAR>value</VAR>
   imbeds <VAR>on</VAR> .html
</PRE>
<P>
<B><I>Default&#58;</I></B>
<PRE>
   imbeds <VAR>on</VAR> .shtml
</PRE>
<P>
For more information about the imbeds directive, see
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRIMBEDS">"imbeds - Specify whether server-side includes will be dynamically imbedded"</A>.
<P>
The server does not process your error files for imbeds, regardless
of the file extensions or use of the imbeds directive.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRSSCMD" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_511">Format for server-side includes</A></H2>
<P>Server-side includes allow you to insert information into
CGI programs and HTML documents that the server sends to the client.
The current date, the size of a file, the last change of
a file are examples of the kind of information that can be
sent to the client.  There are commands that need to be included
in the HTML document comments.  The commands have the following
format:
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_512">Syntax</A></H3>
<PRE>
   &lt;!--#command tag=value ... --&gt;
   &lt;!--#command tag="value" ... --&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The quotes around <VAR>value</VAR> are optional.  They are
required for imbedding spaces.
<P>
The following commands are accepted by the server&#58;
<DL>
<P><DT>config
<P><DD>Controls certain aspects of file processing.  Valid tags
are:
<DL>
<P><DT>cmntmsg
<P><DD>Specifies the message that gets appended to the beginnning of any
text that follows a
directive specification and comes before "--&gt;".
<P>
<B><I>Example&#58;</I></B>
<PRE>
   &lt;!--#config cmntmsg="&#91;This is a comment&#93;" --&gt;
   &lt;!--#echo var=" " extra text --&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
<B><I>Result</I></B>&#58;  (Output from the <TT>echo</TT>)
<TT>&lt;!--This is a comment extra text --&gt;
</TT>
<P>
<B><I>Default&#58;</I></B>
<TT>&#91;the following was extra in the directive&#93;
</TT>
<P><DT>errmsg
<P><DD>Specifies the message that gets sent to the client if an
error occurs when a file is being processed.  The message gets
logged in the server's error log.
An example using errmsg follows&#58;
<P>
<B><I>Example&#58;</I></B>
<TT>&lt;!--#config errmsg="&#91; An error occurred&#93;" --&gt;
</TT>
<P>
<B><I>Default&#58;</I></B>
<TT>
"&#91;an error occurred while processing this directive&#93;"
</TT>
<P>
<P><DT>sizefmt
<P><DD>Specifies the format to be used when the file size is
displayed.  <TT>bytes</TT> is the value used for a formatted
number of bytes.  <TT>abbrev</TT> is used for displaying
the number of kilobytes or megabytes.
Several examples using sizefmt follow&#58;
<P>
<B><I>Example 1&#58;</I></B>
<PRE>
   &lt;!--#config sizefmt = bytes --&gt;
   &lt;!--#fsize file=foo.html --&gt;

<P>
<B><I>Default&#58;</I></B> <TT>"abbrev"</TT>
<P>
<P><DT>timefmt
<P><DD>Specifies the format to be used when providing dates.

Server-side includes also allow you to echo a variable
already set.  While defining a directive, you can echo a string in the
middle of "value".
For example:
<PRE>
   &lt;!--#include file="&amp;filename;"--&gt;
</PRE>
If an unrecognized variable is found, nothing gets displayed.
<P>Server-side includes looks for the variable, echos where
the variable is found, and proceeds with the function.
You can have multiple variable references.  You should be
aware of the following characters that can be escaped.
Note that escaped variables are preceded with a backslash (\).

You announce to the world that you want people to come look at the
documents on your server.
But once you publicize your server to the Internet, you risk
attracting unwanted attention to the system on which it runs.
Unauthorized people may try to guess passwords, update files, execute
files, or tap into confidential data.
This chapter describes how to protect your server.

<P>
There are several ways that you can protect your system.
You can place a server meant for public access in a network that
is separate from your local or internal network.
You can disable Telnet, rlogin, and finger clients on the system
that is running the server.
In particular, consider disabling Telnet.
<P>
Other ways to protect the system are packet filtering and firewalls.
Using <B><I>packet filtering</I></B>,
you can define where data can come from
and where it can go.
You can configure your system to reject certain source&#47;destination
combinations.
A <B><I>firewall</I></B> is a way to separate an internal network from a
publicly accessible network, such as the Internet.
The firewall can be a group of computers or a
single computer that acts as a gateway in both directions, regulating and
tracking the traffic passing through it.
An example of firewall software is
the IBM Internet Connection Secured Network Gateway.
<P>
You can configure your server as a proxy server through a firewall.
This way, internal users can get out to the Internet, but outside
Internet travelers cannot get in.
Using a proxy server also ensures that any access to the
Internet by internal browsers is done anonymously.
Because all of the requests to the Internet are made by the proxy
server on the part of the internal user, the remote host does not
have access to the name of the specific host that is on the inside
of the firewall.
For information on configuring your server as a caching proxy,
see 
<A HREF="icswg003.html#HDRPROXY">"Running your server as a caching proxy"</A>.
For information on using your server on a firewall machine, see
the documentation for your firewall software.
<P>
Part of the attraction of the World Wide Web is its openness.
The Web is open to both positive use and abuse.
In particular, using CGI scripts on a Web server can create a
security exposure.
If you use CGI scripts, you need to protect them by controlling who
has access to them.
<P>
It is possible to write CGI scripts that display all environment
variables.
At times these variables may include sensitive data such as
user IDs and passwords.
So you must be careful about
displaying environment variables in your
CGI scripts and you must be careful about who has access to your
CGI scripts.
Make sure you know what a CGI program does before you make it available
on your server.
<P>
<P>
You must also
decide whether you want to have user directories on your server.
By allowing local users to have their own
Web pages, you may also be creating a security hole in your server.
You need to carefully control the access to the pages on
local users' machines.
You may choose not to allow any local users to have
executable CGI scripts.
See 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRUSER">"User directories"</A>.
<P>
The following sections describe how you
control who has access to the
various files you keep on your server.
The steps first tell you how to set up protection by editing the
configuration file.
When appropriate, the steps tell you which Configuration and
Administration forms you can use to perform the same task.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRACTPROT" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_515">Step 1. Activating protection</A></H2>
<P>
The first step to controlling access to your server&#39;s resources
is to activate protection.
You activate protection based on the content of
requests that clients send to your server.
<P>
This document refers to
a <B><I>request</I></B> as the part of a full
URL that follows your server host name.
For example, if your server is named fine.feathers.com
and a requester enters the following URL on a browser:
<PRE>
<B>http://fine.feathers.com/waterfowl/schedule.html</B>
</PRE>
<P>
The request your server receives is:
/waterfowl/schedule.html
<P>
You can
use Protect directives to specify which requests should activate
protection.
Each Protect directive has a request template.
The server activates
protection when it receives a request
that matches a request template on a Protect directive.
The Protect directive also either identifies or contains the protection
setup to be used.
<P>
See 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRDOCUM">"Access control - Set up access control for the server"</A> for details on how to use Protect directives.
<P>
You can also use the Configuration and Administration forms to
specify which requests should activate protection.
From the Configuration and Administration forms page, click
<B>Document protection</B>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_516" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_516">Step 2. Passing the requests</A></H2>
<P>
Besides activating protection for the requests,
you must also tell your server which requests to accept for processing.
<P>
Use Pass and Exec directives to specify which requests you want your
server to accept.
The Pass and Exec directives map requests to actual directories and
files on your server (the information you are protecting).
<P>
Like the Protect directive, each Pass and Exec directive contains
a request template.
After the server checks to see if a request activates protection,
it goes through its list of Pass and Exec directives
to determine if it should accept the request.
If the request matches a request template on a Pass or Exec directive,
the server <B><I>accepts</I></B> the request.
If protection was
activated, the server uses the protection setup to
determine whether it should <B><I>complete</I></B> the request.
<P>
So for protection to work properly, you must
ensure that your Pass and Exec directives accept the requests that
your Protect directives activate protection for.
Use Pass directives to accept document requests.
Use Exec directives to accept CGI program requests.
<P>
See 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRMAPPI">"Resource mapping - Redirect URLs and define file extensions"</A> for details on how to use the Pass and Exec
directives.
<P>
<B>Attention:</B>  You must put
your Protect directives
before any Pass or Exec
directives in your configuration file.
<P>
You can also use the Configuration and Administration forms to
specify which requests to accept and how to map them to your
actual resources.
From the Configuration and Administration forms page, click
<B>Request Routing</B>.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_517" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_517">Step 3. Deciding what type of protection to use</A></H2>
<P>
You can use two types of protection to control access to your
resources through the server&#58;
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>User name and password protection
<LI>Address template protection.
</UL>
<P>
You can use one type of protection by itself
or both together.
You can use either or both types of protection in
protection setups and Access Control List (ACL) files.
It is helpful to understand these two different types of protection
before you create your protection setups or ACL files.
<P>
The following two sections describe each type of protection.
Following those two sections is a section describing
how the server processes requests based on the type of
protection being used.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_518">User name and password protection</A></H3>
<P>
With this type of protection, you create user names that you want
requesters to use to access your protected resources.
You define each user name and assign it a password in a password file.
<P>
After you define a user name,
you can use it
within protection setups and ACL files to
specify which user names are
valid for different types of requests.
<P>
When the server receives a request that activates this type of
protection, the server prompts the requester for a user name and
password.
In order for the request to complete, the requester must return a
user name and password that meet the following criteria:
<UL>
<P><LI>The user name must be defined in the protection setup or ACL file
as valid for the type of request being made.
<P><LI>The user name must be
defined in the password file identified by the protection setup.
<P><LI>The password must match the one defined for the user name in the
password file.
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_519">Address template protection</A></H3>
<P>
With this type of protection, you use address templates to specify
valid requester addresses for the different types of requests.
You can use address templates in protection setups
and ACL files.
<P>
When the server receives a request that activates this type of
protection, it compares the address of the requester to the templates
to determine if the request comes from a valid address.
The server can use either the IP address of the requester
(for example, 9.67.97.103)
or the host name of the requester
(for example, any.host.name.com)
when comparing against the templates.
<P><B>Note: </B>In order to compare the requester host names against address
templates,
you must set the DNS-Lookup directive to <TT>On</TT>.
If the
DNS-Lookup directive is set to <TT>Off</TT> (the default),
your server can compare only the IP address of the requester to the
address templates.
See 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRDNSLOOK">"DNS-Lookup - Specify whether you want to look up host names of clients"</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_520">How the server processes requests</A></H3>
<P>
Following is a description of how the server
processes a request that has already activated protection
and been accepted by a Pass or Exec directive.
The description assumes that all protection is defined in the
protection setup (no ACL file exists on the protected directory).
<P>
Read over the description now to help you decide what type of
protection you want to use.
You may want to read again in more detail
after going through the steps for
creating protection setups.
<OL>
<P><LI>
Based on the HTTP method of the request, the server refers to the
appropriate mask subdirective
(DeleteMask, GetMask, Mask,
PostMask, or PutMask) in the protection setup.
The mask subdirective specifies valid user names, groups,
or address templates.
<P><LI>
If any items on the mask subdirective use only address
template protection,
the server compares the
address of the requester against the address templates.
<P>
Items that use only address template protection
start with either <TT>@</TT>, <TT>Anybody@</TT>,
<TT>Anyone@</TT>, or <TT>Anonymous@</TT>,
followed by one or more address templates.
Group names on the subdirective might also contain
items that use only address template protection.
<P>
If there is a match, the
server completes the request without
prompting for a user name or password.
<P>
If there is not a match or
no items use address template protection only,
the process continues with the next step.
<P><LI>
If any items on the mask
subdirective are user names or group names,
the server prompts the requester for a
user name and password.
<P><LI>
The server checks the user name sent by
the requester against the valid user names.
Valid user names are either the individual user names on
the mask subdirective or
user names defined as being part of a group that is on the mask
subdirective.
<P>
If there is a match, the process continues with the next step.
<P>
If there is not a match, the process ends and the
server returns a message to the
requester saying that authorization failed.
<P><LI>
If the user name sent by the requester
is also associated with an
address template, the server checks the address of the requester
against the template.
The mask subdirectives and group files use the at sign
character (@) to associate user names or group names with
address templates.
<P>
If there is a match, the process continues with the next step.
<P>
If there is not a match, the process ends and the
server returns a message to the
requester saying that authorization failed.
<P><LI>
The server checks the user name sent by the requester
against the user names in the
password file that the protection setup points to.
<P>
If there is a match, the process continues with the next step.
<P><B>Note: </B>It is important to note that the password file must contain an
entry for the user name that the requester sends to the server.
You make up the user names that are in the password file.
The names themselves do not have any relation to the addresses of the
requesters.
<P>
If there is not a match, the process ends and the
server returns a message to the
requester saying that authorization failed.
<P><LI>
The server checks the password sent by the requester
against the password defined for the user name in the password file.
Each user name in the password file has one valid password.
<P>
If there is a match, the server completes the request.
<P>
If there is not a match, the process ends and the
server returns a message to the
requester saying that authorization failed.
</OL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_521" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_521">Step 4. Creating protection setups</A></H2>
<P>
When a Protect directive
activates protection for a request, it also
either identifies the protection setup to use or defines the
protection setup as part of the directive.
A <B><I>protection setup</I></B> is a group of protection subdirectives.
The subdirectives work
together to define how the server should control access to
the resources being protected.
You can create protection setups three different ways:
<UL>
<P><LI>
You can
create protection setups within the configuration file
as part of Protection, Protect, or DefProt directives.
<P>
When you create a protection setup on a Protection directive,
you give the setup a label that you can point to later from
Protect and DefProt directives.
<P>
When you create a protection setup on a DefProt or
Protect directive, the protection setup is used only for
that directive.
The setup cannot be pointed to by other DefProt or Protect directives.
This type of protection setup is called an <B><I>in-line</I></B> protection
setup.
<P>
You indicate you are including a protection setup
as part of a Protection, Protect, or DefProt directive
by making the last character on the line that contains the directive
a left brace character (&#123;).
On each
following line you put
one protection subdirective and its value.
You indicate the end of the protection setup by putting a
right brace character (&#125;) by
itself on the line following the last protection subdirective.
You cannot use comments within the protection setup.
<P>
See 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRDOCUM">"Access control - Set up access control for the server"</A> for more information and examples of creating
protection setups in the configuration file.
<P><LI>
You can
create separate protection setup files that you can then
point to from Protect and DefProt directives.
A protection setup file is a plain text file.
Within the file, each line contains one
protection subdirective and the value for that subdirective.
<P><LI>
You can
use the Configuration and Administration forms to create protection
setups within the configuration file.
From the Configuration and Administration forms page, click
<B>Document protection</B> and specify you want to
create an in-line protection setup.
Or, from the Configuration and Administration forms page, click
<B>Protection setups</B> to add, change, or delete named
protection setups.
</UL>
<P>
Within the protection setup,
the protection subdirectives control
access to the directory or files being protected.
The following sections describe how to use each of the protection
subdirectives.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_522">Identifying the protection setup to requesters</A></H3>
<P>
For user name and password protection,
use the ServerID subdirective
to specify a name you want to use to
identify the protection setup to requesters.
The name does not need to be a real machine name.
<P>
When the server sends a requester a prompt for user name and password,
it also includes the name you specify on ServerID.
Most browsers display this name with the prompt.
Because different protection setups can use different
password files, having a name associated with the protection setup
can help
the requester decide which user name and password to send back.
Many browsers also attempt to automatically send a user name and
password if the requester has
previously responded to a prompt from a protection setup with the
same name.
<P>
If the protection setup is using address
template protection only, you do not need to use the
ServerID subdirective.
<P>
If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, you
specify this name in the <B>Server identifier</B> field on the
Protection Setup form.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_523">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   ServerID restricted
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_524">Specifying the type of authentication</A></H3>
<P>
The AuthType subdirective specifies the type of authentication to use
when a client sends a password to the server.
For user name and password protection, you must
use the AuthType
subdirective with a value of <TT>Basic</TT>.
With basic authentication, passwords are sent to the server as plain
text.
They are encoded, but not encrypted.
<P>
If the protection setup is using address
template protection only, you do not need to use the
AuthType subdirective.
<P>
For a secure server, if you are using S-HTTP for secure transactions
and do not want the client prompted for a user name and password,
set AuthType to <TT>None</TT>.
You must also specify <TT>Anybody@(*)</TT>, <TT>Anyone@(*)</TT>,
or <TT>Anonymous@(*)</TT> for the appropriate mask subdirective
in the protection setup.
Then, documents are protected by the cryptographic options
(CRYPTOPTS) you specify in the protection setup.
<P>
If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, you
specify the authentication type in the
<B>Authentication type</B> field on the
Protection Setup form.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_525">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   AuthType Basic
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_526">Pointing to the password file</A></H3>
<P>
For user name and password protection,
use the PasswdFile
subdirective to specify the path and name of the password file
that you want the protection setup to use.
<P>
Each password file contains a list of user names and passwords.
Each user name has one valid password defined for it.
The requester must send back a user name and password that exactly
matches a user name and password in the password file.
<P>
If the protection setup is using address
template protection only, you do not need to use the
PasswdFile subdirective.
<P>
If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, you
specify the file path and name of the password file in the
<B>Password file</B> field on the
Protection Setup form.
<P>
You create and maintain
password files using the htadm command.
See 
<A HREF="icswg014.html#HDRHTADM">"htadm command"</A> for information on how to create and maintain
password files.
<P><B>Note: </B>The user names in the password file
do not have any relation to the addresses of the
requesters.
You make up the user names and passwords.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_527">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   PasswdFile  c&#58;\WWW\restrict.password
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_528">Pointing to a server group file</A></H3>
<P>
If you want to use group names in the protection setup,
use the GroupFile subdirective to specify the path and
file name of the server
group file that contains the group definitions you
want to use.
The groups defined within the server group file can then be used by:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Any mask subdirectives that are part of the protection setup.
(The mask subdirectives are
DeleteMask, GetMask, Mask,
PostMask, and PutMask.)
<P><LI>
Any ACL file on a directory that is protected by the protection setup.
</UL>
<P>
See 
<A HREF="#HDRUSGF">"Using server group files"</A> more information about server group files.
<P>
If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, you
specify the file path and name in the <B>Group file</B>
field on the Protection Setup form.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_529">Example:</A></H5>
<PRE>
   GroupFile d&#58;\docs\WWW\restrict.group
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRPRCRYPT">Specifying CRYPTOPTS in protection setups</A></H3>
<P>
<A HREF="icswg011.html#HDRSHTTP">"Using Secure HTTP"</A> describes how to use secure HTTP (S-HTTP)
with a secure server.
S-HTTP is a message-based security protocol that allows you to specify
the security you want for each transaction between a client and
server.
<A HREF="icswg011.html#HDRCOS">"Specify CRYPTOPTS"</A> describes the CRYPTOPTS you can specify in
the anchors of your HTML documents.
<P>
You also want to specify CRYPTOPTS in protection setups,
ACL files, or both to control how a secure server serves documents.
The CRYPTOPTS you specify in protection setups and ACLs
must be consistent with the CRYPTOPTS coded in an anchor.
If CRYPTOPTS are coded in protection setups and ACL files, the
server compares the CRYPTOPTS in the protection setups and then
the ACL files with the client's CRYPTOPTS, which are based on
the anchor coding.
If the client's CRYPTOPTS and the CRYPTOPTS in protection setups or
ACL files are not consistent, a secure server will not serve the
document.
<P>
You can use the Protection Setup form to specify
the SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements CRYPTOPTS.
(To get to the Protection Setup form, you need to fill in the
Document Protection form and click <B>Apply</B>.)
If you want to specify other CRYPTOPTS, you will have to use the
CRYPTOPTS subdirectives.
<P>
The CRYPTOPTS subdirectives are:
<UL>
<P><LI>Crypt: To specify CRYPTOPTS for all S-HTTP requests
<P><LI>DeleteCrypt: To specify CRYPTOPTS for S-HTTP requests to delete
files
<P><LI>GetCrypt: To specify CRYPTOPTS for S-HTTP requests to get files
<P><LI>PostCrypt: To specify CRYPTOPTS for S-HTTP requests to post files

<P>
Put each CRYPTOPTS subdirective on one line.
The subdirectives have a cumulative effect.
In the above example, a secure server will only serve the document if
the client's request is PKCS-7 format, signed, and encrypted.
A secure server's response message, including the document,

<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRUMASK">Specifying valid user names, groups, and addresses</A></H3>
<P>
Use the mask subdirectives to
specify valid
user names, groups, and address templates for different
types of requests.
The mask subdirectives protect the entire directory that the
request is mapped to.
<P>
Each request to your server contains an HTTP method
field that identifies the type of request being made.
See 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRMETHO">"Methods - Set method acceptance"</A> for a description of the HTTP methods
supported by the server.
Choose which mask subdirectives to use based on the
types of requests you want to authorize.
For a protection setup to be valid, it must contain at least
one of the following mask subdirectives:
<UL>
<P><LI>DeleteMask - to authorize DELETE requests.
<P><LI>GetMask - to authorize GET requests.
<P><LI>PostMask - to authorize POST
requests. (Most HTML forms use the POST method.)
<P><LI>PutMask - to authorize PUT requests.
<P><LI>Mask - to authorize requests using any
enabled methods not covered by the other mask
subdirectives.
Other mask subdirectives take precedence over
the Mask subdirective if both are present in the protection setup.
For example, if a protection setup contains a DeleteMask
subdirective and a Mask subdirective, DELETE requests are covered
by the DeleteMask subdirective and all other requests are covered by
the Mask subdirective.

Following are explanations and examples of
the different ways you can specify
user names, group names, and address templates
on mask subdirectives.
The same rules also apply for specifying user names, group
names, and address templates in server group files and ACL files.
If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, the
same rules apply to the values you can enter in the
Get, Put, Post, Delete, and All fields on the Protection Setup form.
<UL>
<P><LI>You can specify a user name without an address template.
The user name must be defined in the protection setup password file.
If the requester returns the user name with the correct password,
the server completes the request.
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P><LI>
You can specify an address template without a user name.
If the requester address matches the address template,
the server completes the request without prompting the requester
for a user name and password.
<P>
The address template can be based on either IP address or host name.
Use the asterisk character (*) as a wildcard in any part or the
template.
To indicate you want to use address template protection only,
precede the template with one of the following:
<TT>@</TT>,
<TT>Anybody@</TT>, <TT>Anyone@</TT>, or <TT>Anonymous@</TT>.

templates,
you must set the DNS-Lookup directive to <TT>On</TT>.
If the
DNS-Lookup directive is set to <TT>Off</TT> (the default),
your server can compare only the IP address of the requester to the
address templates.
See 
<A HREF="icswg005.html#HDRDNSLOOK">"DNS-Lookup - Specify whether you want to look up host names of clients"</A>.
<P><LI>
You can specify a user name with an address template.
The user name must be defined in the protection setup password file.
Separate the user name from the address template with the at sign
character (@).
If the requester returns the user name with the correct password and
the requester address matches the address template,
the server completes the request.
<PRE>
   GetMask   webfoot@96.96.*.*

A group name can include user names, other group names, and
address templates in any of
the same formats allowed on masking subdirectives.
To be valid,
any user names included in the group name
must also be defined in the protection setup password file.

<P>
Perform this step only if you
want to limit access to specific files on
directories already protected by the protection setup.
<P>
To limit access to specific files on a protected directory, you
create an
Access Control List (ACL) file and place it on the directory.
The ACL file must be named &#46;www_acl.
<P>
Normally, the mask subdirectives in the protection setup
define the first level of access control and then the
ACL file further limits access.
However,
if you want all control to come from the
ACL file, use the
ACLOverride subdirective with a value of <TT>On</TT>
in the protection setup.
This causes the mask subdirectives
in the protection setup to be ignored.
All access control is passed to the
ACL file.
<P>
See 
<A HREF="#HDRUACLF">"Using Access Control List (ACL) files"</A> for more information about ACL files.
<P>
If you are using the Configuration and Administration forms, you

If a protected directory contains
an ACL file, the rules in the ACL file
can also use
the groups defined in the server group file.
<P>
You can create as many server group files as you need.
Create each in a separate text file.
Within the server group file, each line contains a group definition
using the following format:

<P>
For a secure server to server the document,
the requester must specify any
user name and password in the protection setup password file.
Also, the request for the document
must be PKCS-7 format and signed and encrypted.
<P>
In the above example, access could have been restricted to individuals
by coding, for example, <TT>swandude@9.67.84.5</TT> for the GetMask.
For a secure server to serve the document,
swandude at 9.67.84.5 must specify his user name and password from
the protection setup password file.
Also, the request for the document
must be PKCS-7 format and signed and encrypted.
<P>
If you only want to use CRYPTOPTS for protection
(instead of using password protection and CRYPTOPTS) you
can specify AuthType of None and CRYPTOPTS:
<P>
<PRE>
Protection SIGN_AND_ENCRYPT_ONLY {
   AuthType    None
   GetCrypt    SHTTP-Privacy-Domains: recv-required=PKCS7
   GetCrypt    SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements: recv-required=sign,encrypt
   GetMask     Anybody@(*)
}
</PRE>
<P>
For a secure server to serve the document, the request for the document
must be PKCS-7 format and signed and encrypted.
The requester will not be prompted for a user ID and password.
<P>
The Protect directive that maps the request to the protection setup
follows the protection setup:
<P>
<PRE>
Protect \secure_docs\* SIGN_AND_ENCRYPT_ONLY
</PRE>
<P>
Any request beginning with secure_docs activates protection as
defined in the protection setup SIGN_AND_ENCRYPT_ONLY
<P>
<P><B>Note: </B>If you code CRYPTOPTS only in ACL files and not in protection
setups, you must also have a Protect statement like the one in the
above example.

<H2><A NAME="Header_545" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_545">Security concepts</A></H2>
<P>
The Internet was not originally designed to protect sensitive or
confidential data.
However, with the advent of electronic commerce, such as online
shopping and online bill paying, information privacy becomes necessary.
In addition, intra-company communications over the Internet often
contain confidential product information that needs to be protected
from general access.
Routing computers can listen to and record any communications
that pass through.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_546">The Internet is a postal service</A></H3>
<P>
Think of the Internet as a new postal service.
This new service operates at blinding speed, sorting and routing
messages through various post offices in seconds.
<P>
Unfortunately, this new postal service has an awkward twist to it.
Anyone and everyone can be a postmaster, and there is
nothing to prevent a postmaster from reading, copying, and even
altering the mail as it passes through the post office.
Another drawback is the lack of receiver accountability, for items
such as
registered letters that require signatures or return receipts.
As a result, you cannot be sure that the intended recipient received
the mail you sent.
<P>
Because the Internet was designed to be an open system,
it allows any computer on the network to see the messages passing
through.
You can safely estimate that 20% of the messages you send
on the Internet will be copied and stored somewhere by someone else
for future reference.
Because most messages are sent as plain block text,
there is no limit to the different software platforms
that can read, copy, and possibly alter the messages you send.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_547">What is security?</A></H3>
<P>
You would never think of sending your medical records or paying your
bills by postcard.
By the same token, few people want to use the Internet,
in its present form,
for commercial exchanges without additional security.
<P>
You can consider an information transaction to be secure if it has
these characteristics:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Confidentiality
<LI>Integrity
<LI>Accountability
<LI>Authenticity
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_548">Confidentiality</A></H4>
<P>
Confidentiality means that the contents of the messages remain private
as they pass through the Internet.
Without confidentiality,
your computer broadcasts the message to the network,
similar to shouting the information across a crowded room.
<B><I>Encryption</I></B> ensures confidentiality.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_549">Integrity</A></H4>
<P>
Integrity means that messages are not altered while being transmitted.
Any router along the way can insert or delete text or garble the message
as it passes by.
Without integrity,
you have no guarantee that the message you sent matches the
message received.
Encryption and <B><I>digital signature</I></B> ensure integrity.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_550">Accountability</A></H4>
<P>
Accountability means that
both the sender and the receiver agree that the exchange took place.
Without accountability,
the addressee can easily say the message never arrived.
Digital signature also ensures accountability.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_551">Authenticity</A></H4>
<P>Authenticity means that you know who you are talking to
and that you can trust that person.
Without authenticity,
you have no way to be sure that anyone is who they say they are.
<B><I>Authentication</I></B> ensures authenticity.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_552">What is encryption?</A></H3>
<P>
Encryption in its simplest form is scrambling a message so that it
cannot be read until it is unscrambled later by the receiver.
The sender uses an algorithmic pattern, or <B><I>key</I></B>,
to scramble, or encrypt, the message.
The receiver has the decryption key.
Encryption ensures confidentiality in transmissions
sent over the Internet.
<P>
There are two kinds of keys that can be used for encryption
(as well as for digital signature and authentication):
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Symmetric
<LI>Asymmetric
</UL>
<B><I>Symmetric</I></B> keys follow an age-old model of the sender and
receiver sharing some kind of pattern.
This same pattern is then used by the sender to encrypt the message
and by the receiver to decrypt the message.
You may have used this model when you decoded the secret message
on the back of a cereal box using your secret decoder ring.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0s03.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0s03 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The risk involved with symmetric keys is that you have to find a
safe transportation method to use when sharing your secret
key with the people with which you want to communicate.
<P>
With <B><I>asymmetric</I></B> keys, you create a <B><I>key pair</I></B>.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0s04.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0s04 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
The key pair is made up of a <B><I>public key</I></B> and a
<B><I>private key</I></B>, which are different from each other.
The private key holds
more of the secret encryption pattern than the public key.
<P>
As a sender,
you can then broadcast your public key to whomever you want to
communicate securely.
You hold on to the private key and protect it with a password.
<P>
Unlike symmetric keys, the private key and the public key are not
the same.
As a result, only you can decrypt a message that has been encrypted
with your public key, because only you have the private key.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0s05.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0s05 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
Reflexively, only someone who has your public key can decrypt
a message that you encrypt using your private key.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0s06.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0s06 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_553">What is digital signature?</A></H3>
Digital signature uses a <B><I>message digest</I></B>
(a digital fingerprint).
A message digest is based on a generated number or string of characters
that are unique to a transmission.
A message digest is also known as a <B><I>hash</I></B>.
<P>
The server creates a 128-bit message
digest based on the message you
want to send.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0s07.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0s07 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
Next, you sign the message by encrypting
the message digest with your private key.
Your message is then sent, along with the encrypted message digest.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0s08.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0s08 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The receiver then decrypts the message digest
with your public key and then creates a message digest
from your message.
She compares the two message digests and if they are the
same, she knows that the message has not been altered in transmission.
<P>
This process is different if you are going to both sign and encrypt
the message.
If you are going to both sign and encrypt,
the message and the encrypted message digest are encrypted with
the public key of the intended receiver.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0s09.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0s09 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The receiver then decrypts the message and the encrypted message digest
with her private key
and decrypts the message digest with your public key.
She then creates a message digest from your message.
She compares the two message digests and if they are the
same, she knows that the message has not been altered in transmission.
<P>
Because you have signed the message with your private
key and you have the only copy of that key, it is safe
for the receiver of the message to assume that the message
is from you.
This is also called <B><I>non-reputability of origin</I></B>.
As you can see, digital signature can ensure data integrity and
accountability for an Internet transmission.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_554">What is authentication?</A></H3>
<P>
Authentication is the process used to verify identity, so that you can
make sure that others are who they say they are.
There are two ways in which the server uses authentication:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Digital signature
<LI>Digital certificates
</UL>
<P>
As covered in the previous section, digital
signature ensures accountability.
But how do you know if the person sending you a message
is who he says he is?
<P>
You look at the sender's <B><I>digital certificate</I></B>.
If you can think of a digital signature as being like a credit card
with your picture on it,
then digital certificate is like a credit card with a picture
of the bank president with his arm around you.
A merchant will trust you more because not only do you look like
the picture on the credit card, the bank president trusts you, too.
<P>
You base your trust for the authenticity of the sender
on whether you trust the third party
(a person or agency) that certified the sender.
The third party or <B><I>certification authority (CA)</I></B>
issues digital certificates.
<P>
A certificate is made up of:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>The public key of the person being certified
<LI>The name and address of the person being certified,
also known as the <B><I>Distinguished Name</I></B>
<LI>The digital signature of the CA
<LI>The issue date
<LI>The expiration date
</UL>
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0s14.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0s14 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The Distinguished Name is the name and address of a person or
organization.
At a minimum, it is someone's name.
You enter your Distinguished Name as part of requesting a certificate.
The digitally-signed certificate includes not only your own Distinguished
Name, but the Distinguished Name of the CA.
<P>
CAs broadcast their public key and Distinguished Name bundled together
so that people will add them as a <B><I>trusted root</I></B> key to their
Web servers and browsers.
When you designate the public key and certificate
from a certification authority to be a trusted root key means that your
server will trust anyone who has a certificate from that certification
authority.
You may have many trusted roots as part of your server.
In fact, the server includes several default trusted root keys,
and you can add others as needed.
<P>
In order to communicate securely, the receiver in a transmission
must trust the CA that issued the certificate that the sender is using.
This is true whether the receiver is a Web server or browser.
As a result, any time a sender signs a message, the receiver
must have the corresponding CA certificate and public key
designated as a trusted root key.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_555" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_555">Using the security built into the server</A></H2>
<P>As part of the server, there are two different security
implementations that you can choose between:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
<LI>Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (S-HTTP)
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_556">What is SSL?</A></H3>
<P>
SSL is a security protocol that was developed
by Netscape Communications Corporation, along with RSA** Data Security,
Inc.
This protocol ensures that data transferred between a client and a
server remains private.
It allows the client to authenticate the identity of the server.
<P>
Once your server has a digital certificate,
SSL-enabled browsers like the IBM Secure WebExplorer and
Netscape** Navigator can communicate securely with your server using SSL.
With SSL, you can easily establish a security-enabled Web site on
the Internet or on your corporate TCP/IP network.
<P>
SSL uses a security handshake to initiate the TCP/IP connection
between the client and the server.
During the handshake, the client and server agree on the
security keys that they will use for the session,
and the client authenticates the server.
After that, SSL is used to encrypt and decrypt all of
the information in both the <B>https</B> request and the server
response, including:
<UL>
<P><LI>The URL the client is requesting
<P><LI>The contents of any form being submitted
<P><LI>Access authorization information like user names and passwords
<P><LI>All data sent between the client and the server
</UL>
<P>
For more information on how to use SSL,
see 
<A HREF="icswg010.html#HDRSSL">"Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)"</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_557">What is S-HTTP?</A></H3>
<P>
S-HTTP is a security-enhanced variation of HTTP proposed by Enterprise
Integration Technologies (EIT).
This message-based protocol allows you flexibility in how data
is transferred securely between a client and a server.
It allows the server to authenticate the identity of the client,
and it allows the client to authenticate the server.
<P>
With S-HTTP, both the server and any potential client must have
certificates.
S-HTTP uses a security negotiation to initiate the TCP/IP connection
between the client and the server.
During the negotiation, the client and server agree on the kind
of security they will use and then they proceed accordingly.
<P>
For more information on how to use S-HTTP,
see 
<A HREF="icswg011.html#HDRSHTTP">"Using Secure HTTP"</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRPCKSEC">Why use one security protocol instead of the other?</A></H3>
<P>
Both SSL and S-HTTP are proven to provide safe, secure transmissions
over open networks.
However, you may not be sure why you would want to use one versus
the other.
<P>
SSL and S-HTTP work differently:
<UL>
<P><LI>SSL operates just above the TCP/IP transport level, but below
the application-protocol level
<P><LI>S-HTTP adds message-based security specifically to the
HTTP application protocol
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0s02.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0s02 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
</UL>
<P>
SSL and S-HTTP use certificates for authentication differently:
<UL>
<P><LI>SSL uses server-side certificates only
<P><LI>S-HTTP uses certificates for both the server and the client
to authenticate each other
</UL>
<P>
SSL and S-HTTP may use different underlying cryptography:
<UL>
<P><LI>SSL does not allow you to choose cryptographic options
<P><LI>S-HTTP allows you to choose cryptographic options
</UL>
<P>
SSL is easier to set up and use.
There are currently more SSL-enabled browsers in use than
S-HTTP-enabled browsers.
This makes SSL an ideal protocol to use for commerce on the
Internet, because credit card information sent over SSL is
encrypted, and therefore, private.
However, because there is no client authentication, it may not
be suitable for transactions in which the server must ensure
who the client is before responding.
<P>
For example, if you were setting up a server to do banking over the
Internet, you might want to use S-HTTP.
You would want to authenticate the customers and their
account numbers before you allowed them to transfer money.
You would also want to be able to encrypt their confidential
account balance information so that it remained private.
S-HTTP, however, has a much greater user impact.
<P>
Although the two security protocols operate differently, SSL and
S-HTTP are not mutually exclusive.
If you want to,
you can use both SSL and S-HTTP to serve different documents
as part of the same server, but not as part of the same transaction.
<P>
A security example is provided with the server.
The example provides instructions for how to create a working
example of HTML with S-HTTP and SSL anchors.
To have a working example, the server must have a public-private
key pair and a certificate.
For S-HTTP, the client must also have a public-private key pair
and a certificate.
To display the example, type the following URL:
<P>
<B>http://<VAR>your.server.name</VAR>/examples/shttp_test.html</B>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_559" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_559">Managing your keys, certificates, and trusted roots</A></H2>
<P>
The server uses the public key cryptography from RSA Data Security, Inc.,
for encryption, message digest, and authentication.
RSA public key cryptography is commonly used in the computer industry.
<P>
We provide forms that you can use to manage your keys,
<B><I>key ring</I></B>
file passwords, certificates, and trusted roots.
A key ring file is a file where you keep public keys, private keys,
certificates, and trusted root keys.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_560">Working with keys</A></H3>
<P>
As discussed earlier in this chapter,
public key cryptography uses a pair of asymmetric keys
for encryption and decryption.
<P>
When you create a key pair, you are asked to provide the
name of the key ring where you want to keep the key pair
and a password for the key ring.
Then, whenever you want to use a Key Management form, such
as Designate Trusted Root Keys, you'll be asked for the
key ring password.
<P>
The default trusted root keys that are part of the server will
automatically be added any time you create a key ring.
<P>
The server also provides you with the ability to:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Change your key ring password
<LI>Set a private key as the default
<LI>Delete keys
<LI>Export a key by copying it to a file
<LI>Import a key from an exported copy and add it to a key ring
</UL>
<P>
You can access these key management functions from the
Key Management form.
To access this form:
<OL>
<P><LI>Go to the front page of your server and
click <B>Configuration and Administration forms</B>.
<P><LI>You are prompted for your user name and password.
Type them in and click <B>OK</B>.
<P><LI>The Configuration and Administration forms page appears.
Page down until you find the topic Security.
Select <B>Key Management</B>.

<P>
The key management forms require that you enter the
key ring password before you can use them.
If you have multiple key rings, always make sure that
you are making changes to the correct key ring by checking the
key file name and path displayed on the form.
When you complete your key management tasks, always make sure
that the key ring that contains the server's keys you want
to use for secure communications is the current key ring.
You can use
the Security Configuration form to designate a key ring
as the current key ring.
<P>
When you apply the changes you've made to a security form, you
will receive a confirmation message that the changes have been
successfully completed.
You can make changes to other Configuration and Administration forms.
However, when you are ready for the changes you've made to
any security forms to take effect, you must stop the
server and then start it again.  The server will not pick up your
changes if you only restart it.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_561">Changing your key ring password</A></H4>
<P>
Use the Change Password form to change the password for the
current key ring file.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0o02.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0o02 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The current key ring file name is displayed.
To change your password:
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_562">Old password</A></H5>
<P>Enter the current password used to protect the key ring file.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_563">Specify a new password</A></H5>
<P>
Use this part of the form to specify the new password to protect
your key ring.
<P>
The password is important because it protects a private key.
The server uses its private key to
decrypt messages from clients and to sign messages to clients.
The CA private key is used to sign the client and server certificates
processed by the certutil command.
<P>
The security of a private key depends
upon this password.
Here are some commonly accepted rules for specifying passwords:
<UL>
<P><LI>Make your password at least six characters.
<P><LI>Make sure your password doesn't spell a word.
<P><LI>Make sure your password doesn't consist of publicly
obtainable information about
you; for example, the initials and birth date for you, your spouse,
or children.
<P><LI>Include at least two, nonconsecutive numbers in your password.
</UL>
<P>
Type the password twice to ensure that you have typed
it correctly.
<P>
If you must record the password, make sure it is stored in a
well-secured place.
<P>
The key ring password must be specified when
the server is started.
Check <B>Automatic login</B> if you want the server to stash
the password and specify it for you whenever the server is started.
<P>
Stashing the server's key ring password is less secure so
it's generally a good practice not to stash it.
However, there may be cases where you need to stash the password;
for example, if you have a remote server and you want it to
automatically restart after a power failure.
<P>
If you are changing the CA key ring password, do not stash it.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_564">Expiration</A></H5>
<P>Select whether you want the password to never expire or the length
of time you want the password to be active.
If you do select an expiration date, a message is written to the
error log when the password expires.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_565">Setting the default key</A></H3>
<P>
Use the Manage Keys form to set a private key as the default
key.
The default key should be the private key the server uses for its
secure communications.

<H5><A NAME="Header_566">Specify key</A></H5>
<P>Select the key you want to set as default, as long as it is
not a trusted root key.
You cannot set a trusted root key as a default because  trusted
root keys cannot send and receive messages.
The trusted roots are marked with an asterisk (*).

If you need to transfer a key pair or certificate
to another computer,
you can export it to a file.
On the other computer, you can import it
into a key ring.
<P>
Use the Export Keys form to export a key pair or
certificate
to a file.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0o05.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0o05 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>

<P>
To export:
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_572">Specify key</A></H5>
<P>Select the key pair or certificate that you want to export.
Trusted root keys are designated with an "*".
You may need to transfer a key pair for your own use;
however, keep in mind that a key pair contains the private key, which
should never be transmitted to others.
The private key is what the server uses to sign messages and
also to decrypt messages that clients have encrypted with the
server's public key.
If you are acting as your own CA for a private Web network,
the CA private key is used to sign the certificates you process
as CA.
If the CA private key is compromised, then all the certificates
issued by you as a CA are also compromised.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_573">Export to file</A></H5>
<P>Enter the name of the file to which you want to export the
key pair or certificate.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_574">Armor password</A></H5>

<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_577">Armor password</A></H5>
<P>Enter the password that was used to protect the export file.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_578">Obtaining a certificate</A></H3>
<P>
Your public key must be tied to a digitally signed certificate from a
(CA).
There are two different ways that you can obtain a certificate:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Buy a certificate from a CA
<LI>Issue yourself a certificate using the certutil command
</UL>
<P>
It's not a good practice to share certificates among servers.
As you'll see later, the server's keys are kept on a key ring
with the server's certificate.
You do not want servers to share a private key, particularly
if they are running on different machines.
A private key should never be communicated to others.
<P>
VeriSign** certificates can't be shared among servers
on different machines.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_579">Buying a certificate from a CA</A></H4>
<P>
You can buy a signed certificate by submitting a
certificate request to a CA.
VeriSign, Inc.
will issue certificates to Internet Connection Secure Server customers.
We expect that there may be other certification
authorities over time.
<P>
VeriSign will expect you to prove who you are before they will
issue you a certificate.
Although the approval process is necessary to
protect you, your organization, and VeriSign, it may take longer than
you would like.
VeriSign will digitally sign your certificate request and return
the unique certificate to you through e-mail.
Using the remote configuration forms in the server,
you can then receive the signed and valid certificate.
<P>
For more detailed step-by-step information on
how to request a certificate,
see 
<A HREF="icswg010.html#HDRSSL">"Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)"</A> or 
<A HREF="icswg011.html#HDRSHTTP">"Using Secure HTTP"</A>.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_580">Issuing certificates yourself</A></H4>
<P>
If you act as a CA, you can sign your own or anyone else's
certificate request.
This is a good choice if you only need the certificates within your
organization and not for outside Internet commerce.
<P>
For example, if your company is working on a top secret
project and you want to allow access only to a carefully
controlled group of key people, you might want to issue them
certificates so that they can share information covertly and safely.
<P>
If you choose to issue your own certificates, you will need to give the
file that contains the signed certificate to Secure WebExplorer users.
They can then use WebExplorer KeyManager to read the certificate and designate it
as an additional trusted root.
<P>
For more detailed step-by-step information on
how to issue certificates, see 
<A HREF="icswg012.html#HDROWNCA">"Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network"</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_581">Using trusted root keys</A></H3>
<P>
In order for the server to trust a request coming from a client, it
must trust the CA that issued the client certificate.
If you want to trust certificates coming from a CA
other than the default trusted roots included with the server,
you must receive a certificate from that CA
and designate it as a trusted root.
<P>
With the remote configuration forms, you can:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Designate a public key and certificate as a trusted root key
<LI>Remove trusted root status from a public key and certificate

This chapter explains how to use SSL to make the server's communications
secure.

<H2><A NAME="Header_587" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_587">Overview of SSL security</A></H2>
<P>
HTTPS is a unique protocol that combines SSL and HTTP.
You need to specify <B>https&#58;//</B> as an anchor in HTML
documents that link to SSL-protected documents.
A client user can also open a URL by specifying <B>https&#58;//</B>
to request an SSL-protected documents.
<P>
Because HTTPS (HTTP + SSL) and HTTP are different protocols and
usually use different ports (443 and 80, respectively), you can
run both secure and non-secure HTTP servers at the same time.
As a result, you can choose to provide information to all users
using no security, and specific information only to browsers who
make secure requests.
This is how a retail company on the Internet can allow users to
look through the merchandise without security, but then fill
out order forms and send their credit card numbers using security.
<P>
A browser that does not have support for HTTP over SSL will
naturally not be able to request URLs using HTTPS.
The non-SSL browsers will not allow submission of forms that
need to be submitted securely.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRSSLSET" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_588">Step 1. Setting up SSL</A></H2>
<P>
To implement security you need to specify the port you'll use for
secure communications.
<P>
Also, the server must have a
public-private key pair and a certificate.
<P>
The server uses its private key to sign messages to clients.
The server sends its public key to clients so that they
can encrypt messages to the server, which the server decrypts
with its private key.
<P>
To send its public key to clients, the server needs a certificate.
The certificate contains the server's public key, the Distinguished
Name associated with the server's certificate, the serial number
of the certificate, and the expiration date of the certificate.
<P>
A certificate is issued by a certification authority (CA),
who verifies that you are who you say you are.
<P>
To conduct commercial business on the Internet, you would
use a CA, such as VeriSign, Inc.,
who is widely known by clients and servers.
<P>
For a private Web network within your own company, university,
or group, you could, with your Internet Connection Secure Server, be
your own CA.
What you need to do to become your own CA and how to process
certificates for this server and other clients and servers is
described in 
<A HREF="icswg012.html#HDROWNCA">"Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network"</A>.
<P>
Use the following <B>Configuration and Administration forms</B>
to set up SSL security:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Security Configuration form to specify the port that will be
used for SSL
<LI>Create Key and Request Certificate form to create the server's

A <B><I>key ring</I></B> is a file where the server keeps one or more
key pairs and certificates.
If you specify a file that doesn't exist, the
server creates the file for you.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_598">Specify the size of the key pair</A></H5>
<P>
Specify the size of the key pair in bits after considering these
factors:
<UL>
<P><LI>The more bits you specify for
the key pair, the more secure your communications.
<P><LI>The more bits you specify, the more processing time required
for encryption and decryption.
<P><LI>With export versions of the server,
you can create a key pair up to 512 bits.
With U.S.-Canadian versions, you can create a larger key pair; however,
if you want clients outside the United States to encrypt messages
to the server,
U.S. export rules require that the key pair be no larger
than 512 bits.
If you want clients outside the United States only to verify your
server's signature or sign messages,
the key pair can be larger than 512 bits.
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_599">4. Specify key ring password</A></H4>
<P>
Use this part of the form to specify the password that protects
the key ring.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b03.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b03 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The password is important because it protects the server's
private key.
The server's private key is the only key that
can decrypt messages encrypted
with the server's public key.
Also, the server signs documents with its private key.
<P>
The security of the server's private key depends
upon this password.
Here are some commonly accepted rules for specifying passwords:
<UL>
<P><LI>Make the password at least six characters.
<P><LI>Make sure the password doesn't spell a word.
<P><LI>Make sure the password doesn't consist of publicly
obtainable information about
you; for example, the initials and birth date for you, your spouse,
or children.
<P><LI>Include at least two, nonconsecutive numbers in the password.
</UL>
<P>
Type the password twice to ensure that you have typed
it correctly.
<P>
If you must record the password, make sure it is stored in a
well-secured place.
<P>
The key ring password must be specified when the server is started.
Check <B>Automatic login</B> if you want the server to stash
the password and specify it for you whenever the server is started.
<P>
Stashing your password is less secure so
it's generally a good practice not to stash it.
However, there may be cases where you need to stash the password;
for example, if you have a remote server and you want it to
automatically restart after a power failure.
<P>
Next, to request the server's certificate, fill in the rest of the
form.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_600">5. Specify Distinguished Name</A></H4>
<P>
Specify the Distinguished Name you want associated with the server's
certificate and used to identify the server's public key.
In it's simplest form, a Distinguished Name is someone's
name.
<P>
The information you provide for Distinguished Name depends upon
whether you want a:
<UL>
<P><LI>VeriSign Low Assurance Certificate.
See 
<A HREF="#HDRDNLOWS">"Specify Distinguished Name for low assurance certificate"</A>.
<P><LI>VeriSign Secure Server Certificate or Other Certificate.
See 
<A HREF="#HDRDNHIGHS">"Specify Distinguished Name for secure server or other certificate"</A>.
</UL>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRDNLOWS">Specify Distinguished Name for low assurance certificate</A></H5>
<P>
For this certificate, the Distinguished Name is
the full name of the user for whom the certificate is being requested.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b04.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b04 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
For <B>User's full name</B>, specify the user's full name and make
sure it is unique.
For example, if you request more than one certificate for Mary Ann
Jones, you might specify Mary Ann Jones1 for the first
request and Mary Ann Jones2 for the second request.
<P>
<B>User's e-mail address</B>
should contain the user's address
where you want VeriSign to mail the certificate.
<P>
Next, you need to provide mailing information, as described in
<A HREF="#HDRMAILTOS">"6. Specify mailing option"</A>.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRDNHIGHS">Specify Distinguished Name for secure server or other certificate</A></H5>
<P>
For these certificates, the Distinguished Name is the server name
and the location of the server.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b11.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b11 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P><B>Note: </B>The text for Distinguished Name will vary,
depending on whether you're
on the VeriSign secure server or the other certificate form.
Also, the User's e-mail address field, which is on the
other certificate form, is not on the VeriSign
secure server certificate form.
<P>
You may use non-alphanumeric characters in Distinguished Name; however,
keep in mind that some platforms have special uses for
some of these characters.
Provide the following information for Distinguished Name:
<UL>
<P><LI>Server Name:  The X.500 common name of the server.
Usually, it is the TCP/IP fully qualified host name; for example,
www.ibm.com.
For a VeriSign secure server certificate request, it must be the fully
qualified host name.
<P><LI>Organizational Unit: Optionally, the organizational unit.
For example, you might specify the division of your company.
<P><LI>Organization:  The name of your organization, such as
the name of your company.
For a secure server certificate, if you already have an account
with VeriSign, the name in this field should match the name on
that account.
<P><LI>Locality/City: Optionally, the city or locality where your
server resides.
<P><LI>State/Province:  The state or province where the server resides.
You must specify at least <B>three</B> characters.
<P><LI>Postal Code:  The postal code or zip code where the server resides.
<P><LI>Country:  The two-character country code for the
country in which the server resides.
</UL>
On the other certificate form, <B>User's e-mail address</B>
should contain the user's address where
you want the CA to mail the certificate.
If you're requesting this server's certificate, which you plan to
process as a CA, leave this field blank.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRMAILTOS">6. Specify mailing option</A></H4>
<P>
The mailing option depends on the kind of certificate being requested:
<UL>
<P><LI>For a VeriSign low assurance certificate,
see 
<A HREF="#HDRMAILLS">"Mailing option for low assurance certificate"</A>.
<P><LI>For a VeriSign secure server certificate,
see

</UL>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRMAILLS">Mailing option for low assurance certificate</A></H5>
<P>
A VeriSign low assurance certificate request must be electronically
mailed to VeriSign.
If you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administrator
what you need to do to electronically mail this request.

<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRMAILHS">Mailing option for secure server certificate</A></H5>
<P>
There is no mailing option on the form for a VeriSign secure server
certificate.
A secure server certificate request must be saved in a file
and manually mailed to VeriSign.
The VeriSign home page,
<B>http://www.verisign.com/ibm</B>,
has instructions on what you need to provide in order
to obtain a secure server certificate from VeriSign.
Some e-mail programs may alter files and should not be used
to send a certificate request.
For example, some programs may pad the lines of a certificate
request with blanks and invalidate it.
Also, if you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administrator
what you need to do to electronically mail this request.
<P>
Go to 
<A HREF="#HDRCOPYS">"7. Save copy of certificate request"</A> for a description of what you need to do next.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="HDRMAILOS">Mailing option for other certificate</A></H5>

If you are behind a firewall, verify with your system administrator
what you need to do to electronically mail this request.
<P><LI><B>Don't mail</B>:  Choose this option if
you plan to act as your own CA for this server's certificate
or if you don't want to electronically mail the certificate
request to another CA at this time.
You can manually mail the certificate request later; however,
some e-mail programs may alter files and should not be used
to send a certificate request.
For example, some programs may pad the lines of a certificate

</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRCOPYS">7. Save copy of certificate request</A></H4>
<P>
It's a good idea to save the certificate request in a
file.
If you're requesting a VeriSign secure server certificate,
you must save the request to file and manually mail it later.
If you're acting as your own CA for this server's certificate,
you also must save the certificate request in a file.
(After you complete this form, you can

<P>
<P>
S-HTTP is a security-enhanced variant of HTTP proposed by
Enterprise Integration Technologies (EIT).
It is a message-based protocol that allows you to choose the
security specifications you want for each transaction between
a client and a server.
<P>
With S-HTTP, you can specify
a wide variety of cryptographic options (CRYPTOPTS)
for each hypertext link
in an HTML document that uses the HTTP protocol.
Hypertext links are defined in the anchor coding.
<P>
In the anchor coding,
you specify the CRYPTOPTS that
tell the client the appropriate security for the document
referenced in the anchor.
For your server, you can choose
whether you want communications to be:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Encrypted
<LI>Signed
<LI>Both encrypted and signed
</UL>
<P>
You also specify CRYPTOPTS in protection setups
and, optionally, in ACL files.
Protection setups protect one or more files in one or more
directories based on URLs.
ACL files limit access to one or more files in a directory.
<P>
The CRYPTOPTS in protection setups and ACL files
enforce the security as the document is served.
You should code these CRYPTOPTS because:
<UL>
<P><LI>The server does not know what CRYPTOPTS were specified
in the anchor coding.
The server only knows what CRYPTOPTS the client is using and
what CRYPTOPTS the client is capable of using based on what the
client sends in its request for the document.
<P><LI>All vendors'
clients may not handle the CRYPTOPTS in an anchor the same way.
</UL>
Therefore, the only way you can ensure the server enforces the security
you want is to code CRYPTOPTS in protection setups and,
optionally, in ACL files.
<P>
The CRYPTOPTS you specify for a document
in an anchor must be consistent with the CRYPTOPTS
you specify in protection setups and ACL files.
If they are not, the server won't serve the document
even if the client has complied with the CRYPTOPTS
specified in the anchor.
Again, the server does not know what was coded in the
anchor.
It uses what you've coded in protection setups and, optionally,
in ACL files to determine how to serve the document.
<P>
Because you can specify different CRYPTOPTS for different
anchors, a client and the server must
negotiate the CRYPTOPTS for each anchor individually.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_615">A scenario</A></H3>
Suppose you create a welcome (or home) page for your
clients using HTTP protocol (transport mode).
Within your welcome page, you specify some anchors
that use S-HTTP.
<P>
You code CRYPTOPTS in each S-HTTP anchor to tell the client
the appropriate security for the document
referenced in the anchor.
<P>
For each document referenced in an S-HTTP anchor, you
code protection setups and ACL files to ensure that the security
you want is enforced when the document is served.
<P>
When a user at a client specifies the URL for your welcome
page, the server serves the welcome page.
<OL>
<P><LI>A user clicks on an S-HTTP anchor on your welcome page.
<P><LI>The client reads the anchor and compares its own CRYPTOPTS
with the CRYPTOPTS specified in the anchor.
<P><LI>If the client cannot comply with the CRYPTOPTS
specified in the anchor, the negotiation fails.
The request for the document will not be sent to the server.
<P>
If the client can comply with the CRYPTOPTS
specified in the anchor, it sends the server its CRYPTOPTS
in a header along with a request for the document.
<P><LI>The server receives the client's request.
<P><LI>The server compares the client's CRYPTOPTS
first with the CRYPTOPTS specified in
its protection setups and then with the CRYPTOPTS specified in
its ACL files.
<P><LI>If the CRYPTOPTS for either
the protection setups or the ACL files are not
consistent with the client's
CRYPTOPTS, the negotiation fails.
The server sends an error message to the client and
doesn't serve the document.
<P>
If the CRYPTOPTS for protection setups
and ACL files are consistent with the client's CRYPTOPTS,
the server serves the document.
</OL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_616">Implementation summary</A></H3>
<P>
To implement S-HTTP, you:
<OL>
<P><LI>Set up S-HTTP security using configuration forms

<H2><A NAME="Header_617" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_617">Step 1. Setting up S-HTTP</A></H2>
<P>
To implement security you need to specify the port you'll use for
secure communications.
<P>
Also, the server must have a
public-private key pair and a certificate.
<P>
The server uses its private key to sign messages to clients.
The server sends its public key to clients so that they
can encrypt messages to the server, which the server decrypts
with its private key.
<P>
To send its public key to clients, the server needs a certificate.
The certificate contains the server's public key, the Distinguished
Name associated with the server's certificate, the serial number
of the certificate, and the expiration date of the certificate.
<P>
A certificate is issued by a certification authority (CA),
who verifies that you are who you say you are.
<P>
To conduct commercial business on the Internet, you would
use a CA, such as VeriSign, Inc.,
who is widely known by clients and servers.
<P>
For a private Web network within your own company, university,
or group, you could, with your Internet Connection Secure Server, be
your own CA.
What you need to do to become a CA and how to process
certificates for this server and other clients and servers is
described in 
<A HREF="icswg012.html#HDROWNCA">"Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network"</A>.
<P>
For S-HTTP, clients also need a public-private key pair and
a certificate.
For Secure WebExplorer, clients can use KeyManager to create their key pair
and request their certificate.
<P>
Use the following Configuration and Administration forms
to set up S-HTTP security for the server:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Security Configuration form to specify the port that will be
used for S-HTTP and how you will use security server-side includes
in your HTML documents
<LI>Create Key and Request Certificate form to create the server's

<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRDTUSSI">3. Decide whether to use server-side includes</A></H4>
<P>
For S-HTTP, as we'll see later, you need to
send clients the server's certificate and Distinguished Name if you
want clients to encrypt messages to the server or to verify
the server's signature.
There are two ways of supplying the server's
certificate and Distinguished
Name in an HTML document or a CGI program:
<UL>
<P><LI>Put the certificate or Distinguished Name directly into
the HTML document or CGI program.
<P><LI>Use a server-side include. A <B><I>server-side include</I></B>
is coding you specify in
an HTML document that tells the server to get the
certificate or Distinguished Name and send it to the client.
</UL>
<P>
It's easier to code a server-side include than to put
a certificate or Distinguished Name directly into a document
or CGI program.
However, server-side includes take more processing time,
which affects the server's performance and slows down response time
for clients.
<P>
Use the <B>Basic</B> form to choose how you

server creates the file for you.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_629">Specify the size of the key pair</A></H5>

Specify the size of the key pair in bits after considering these
factors:
<UL>
<P><LI>The more bits you specify for
the key pair, the more secure your communications.
<P><LI>The more bits you specify, the more processing time required

U.S. export rules require that the key pair be no larger
than 512 bits.
If you want clients outside the United States only to verify your
server's signature or sign messages,
the key pair can be larger than 512 bits.
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_630">4. Specify key ring password</A></H4>

<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b03.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b03 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
<P>
The password is important because it protects the server's
private key.
The server's private key is the only key that
can decrypt messages encrypted
with the server's public key.
Also, the server signs documents with its private key.
<P>
The security of the server's private key depends
upon this password.
Here are some commonly accepted rules for specifying passwords:
<UL>
<P><LI>Make the password at least six characters.
<P><LI>Make sure the password doesn't spell a word.
<P><LI>Make sure the password doesn't consist of publicly
obtainable information about
you; for example, the initials and birth date for you, your spouse,
or children.
<P><LI>Include at least two, nonconsecutive numbers in the password.
</UL>
<P>
Type the password twice to ensure that you have typed
it correctly.
<P>
If you must record the password, make sure it is stored in a
well-secured place.
<P>
The key ring password must be specified when the server is started.
Check <B>Automatic login</B> if you want the server to stash
the password and specify it for you whenever the server is started.
<P>
Stashing your password is less secure so
it's generally a good practice not to stash it.
However, there may be cases where you need to stash the password;
for example, if you have a remote server and you want it to
automatically restart after a power failure.
<P>
Next, to request the server's certificate, fill in the rest of the
form.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_631">5. Specify Distinguished Name</A></H4>
<P>
Specify the Distinguished Name you want associated with the server's
certificate and used to identify the server's public key.
In it's simplest form, a Distinguished Name is someone's
name.
<P>
As we'll see later, you need to specify the Distinguished Name
in an anchor if you want a client to encrypt messages.
<P>
The information you provide for Distinguished Name depends upon
whether you want a:

You may use non-alphanumeric characters in Distinguished Name; however,
keep in mind that some platforms have special uses for
some of these characters.
Provide the following information for Distinguished Name:
<UL>
<P><LI>Server Name:  The X.500 common name of the server.
Usually, it is the TCP/IP fully qualified host name; for example,
www.ibm.com.
For a VeriSign secure server certificate request, it must be the fully
qualified host name.
<P><LI>Organizational Unit: Optionally, the organizational unit.
For example, you might specify the division of your company.
<P><LI>Organization:  The name of your organization, such as
the name of your company.
For a secure server certificate, if you already have an account
with VeriSign, the name in this field should match the name on
that account.
<P><LI>Locality/City: Optionally, the city or locality where your
server resides.
<P><LI>State/Province:  The state or province where the server resides.
You must specify at least <B>three</B> characters.
<P><LI>Postal Code:  The postal code or zip code where the server resides.
<P><LI>Country:  The two-character country code for the
country in which the server resides.
</UL>
On the other certificate form, <B>User's e-mail address</B>

<B>key name</B> you specified on the Create Key
and Request Certificate form.
<P>
After you receive your Confirmation for the Receive
Certificate form,
you can make changes to other Configuration and Administration forms.
However, when you are ready for the changes you've made to
any security forms to take effect, you must stop the server and then
start it again.  The server will not pick up your changes if you
only restart it.
<P>
When you start the server, you will be prompted for
the key ring password unless you stashed it
by selecting <B>Automatic login</B> on the Create Key and

<H2><A NAME="HDRHTMLDOC" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_643">Step 2. Coding an HTML document for S-HTTP</A></H2>
<P>
In this step, we're going to see how to include S-HTTP coding
in your HTML document.
<P>
You need to include security coding in your HTML
document to provide a client with the server's S-HTTP security
specifications.
You use the security coding in your HTML document to:
<UL>
<P><LI>Supply a client with the server's certificate.
You include this coding in the header of an HTML
document.
<P><LI>Supply a client with the security specifications for a
document referenced in an anchor:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Notification of S-HTTP security.
<LI>Optionally,
the Distinguished Name associated with the server's certificate.
<LI>Optionally, CRYPTOPTS.
However, as we'll discuss later, you should always specify the
security you want for SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements.
It is the CRYPTOPTS header that specifies
whether messages should be signed,
encrypted, or both signed and encrypted.
</UL>
</UL>
Now let's see how to code S-HTTP security specifications
in the header and anchors of your HTML document.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRCERTS">Code S-HTTP security in the header of your HTML document</A></H3>
<P>
To set up security, you used the Configuration and
Administration forms.
You used the Create Key and Request Certificate form
to create the server's public/private key pair and request
the server's certificate from a CA.
After the CA sent you the server's certificate, you
used the Receive Certificate form
to receive the certificate into the server's key ring.
<P>
For clients to communicate with the server, they need the:
<UL>
<P><LI>Certificate of the CA who issued the server's certificate.
The CA certificate must be designated as a trusted root.
<P><LI>Server's certificate,
which contains the server's public key,
the Distinguished Name associated with the certificate,
and the signature of the CA who issued the certificate.
The certificate may also contain other information such as its
serial number and the date it expires.
The client will use the server's public key to encrypt messages
to the server and verify the server's signature.
</UL>
<P>
You give the server's certificate to clients by coding one
of the following in the header of your HTML document.
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>CERTS tag followed by the certificate
<LI>Certificate server-side include, coding that tells the server
to get the certificate and send it to the client
</UL>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_645">Important coding considerations</A></H5>
<P>
It's easier to code a server-side include than to put
a certificate directly into your document.
However, server-side includes take more processing time, which affects
the server's performance and slows down response time for
clients.
<P>
To use server-side includes, you need to choose
<B>Enable server-side includes for HTML files only</B> or
<B>Enable server-side includes for both CGI scripts and
HTML files</B> on the Basic form.
You can also limit the documents the server checks
if you use a unique file extension to identify documents with
server-side includes and specify it for
<B>Enable server-side includes for HTML files with extension</B>.
Then, the server checks only the HTML documents with the file extension
you specified.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_646">CERTS tag</A></H4>
<P>
Use a CERTS tag when you want to include the server's
certificate directly in
your HTML document.
It's a good practice to code your CERTS tag as part of the HTML header.
You can have several CERTS tags in your header.
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_647">Format</A></H5>
<P>
<PRE>
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;CERTS FMT=<VAR>format</VAR>&gt;<VAR>certificate</VAR>
&lt;/CERTS&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
<VAR>format</VAR> is the presentation format of the certificate and can
be:
<DL>
<P><DT>PKCS-7
<DD>Public Key Cryptography Standard 7,
developed by RSA Data Security, Inc., and others.
The presentation format is a PKCS-7 signed Data message with
no content and no signer.
<P><DT>PEM
<DD>Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail standard.
The presentation format is
a comma-separated list of base64-encoded X.509 certificates.
</DL>
<P>
<VAR>certificate</VAR> is the actual certificate in the server's
key ring.
<P>
One way to get the certificate directly into your
HTML document is to
serve a document with server-side includes for
the certificate and the Distinguished Name associated with the
certificate.
View the HTML for the document you served.
Then, cut and paste the certificate into your HTML document.
You would also cut and paste the DN into your HTML document as
described later.
If you use the Internet Connection Secure Server, the <VAR>format</VAR> of the certificate will
be PKCS-7 (FMT=PKCS-7).
<P>
How to code server-side includes for your
HTML document is also described later.
For now, here's an example of coding you might use for the
document that would be served so that you could
cut and paste the certificate and
Distinguished Name directly into your HTML document:
<PRE>
&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;!--#certs name=""--&gt;
&lt;!--#dn=""--&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
This example shows double quotes with
no key name specified for certs name or dn.
You can specify a server-side include for a
certificate or DN with double quotes and
no key name when
you want to use the first certificate in the server's key ring.
<P>
Here's an example of how a certificate might look.
The certificate is armored or base 64 encoded.
When the certificate is no longer armored, it
is actually a PKCS-7 signed data message that contains a
certificate.
It is necessary to armor the certificate because it is
a binary message.

In this example, neither DN nor CRYPTOPTS are specified.
After interpreting this anchor,
a Secure WebExplorer
signs the request for the document.
<P>
If an anchor contains a Distinguished Name and no CRYPTOPTS,
a Secure WebExplorer encrypts but does not sign.
<P>
The clients of other vendors might interpret an anchor
with no CRYPTOPTS differently.
Therefore:
<UL>
<P><LI>Always require the CRYPTOPTS you want.

Each header and what it means is described later.
<P><LI><VAR>origmode</VAR>

The <VAR>HeaderOptions</VAR> are described later
when each CRYPTOPTS header is explained.
</UL>
<P>
<H5><A NAME="Header_671">Important coding considerations</A></H5>
<UL>
<P><LI>The general rules for coding CRYPTOPTS in anchors are:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Specify required for <VAR>HeaderOptions</VAR> you want
<LI>Specify refused for <VAR>HeaderOptions</VAR>
you don't want
<LI>Accept optional, the default, only
when it doesn't matter which <VAR>HeaderOption</VAR>
is used.
</UL>
Later, each CRYPTOPTS header is discussed in detail, including
whether to explicitly specify the header or accept the header's default.
<P><LI>If <VAR>origmode</VAR>
is coded in an anchor, it will not be handled in the
same way by all vendors' clients.
Some clients may ignore <VAR>origmode</VAR> in the anchor because it
describes how the server sends responses.
However, a Secure WebExplorer will process <VAR>origmode</VAR> and determine if it can
comply with the CRYPTOPTS the server will use in its
response.
If not, the negotiation fails at this point.
Otherwise, the negotiation doesn't fail until the client sends
the server a request for the document.
<P><LI>All of a CRYPTOPTS header must be on the same line.
You can put CRYPTOPTS= on a line by itself.
However, you must put each CRYPTOPTS header on its own line.
For example:
<PRE>
CRYPTOPTS=
"SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements: orig-required=sign,encrypt;recv-required=sign,encrypt;
SHTTP-Privacy-Domains: orig-required=PKCS-7;recv-required=PKCS-7"
</PRE>
<P><LI>There is another way to specify CRYPTOPTS in your document.
You can specify a set of CRYPTOPTS in the header of your HTML
and give them a name.
Then in your anchor coding, you can use the name of the CRYPTOPTS.
Use this method to save time if you plan to specify the same set
of CRYPTOPTS for more than one anchor.
For example:
<PRE>
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;!--#certs name="jheist"--&gt;
&lt;CRYPTOPTS NAME="heistsch"&gt;
SHTTP-Privacy-Domains: orig-required=PKCS-7;recv-required=PKCS-7;
SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements: orig-required=sign,encrypt;recv-required=sign,encrypt

<H4><A NAME="Header_672">Defaults</A></H4>
<P>
There are defaults for each CRYPTOPTS header.
When you specify <B>shttp://</B> transport mode in an anchor,
the server uses the default CRYPTOPTS for any header
not specified in your anchor coding.
In most cases, the defaults are fine and are recommended.
<P>
There are two CRYPTOPTS you need to ensure are coded
to provide the security you want:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements because it specifies
the security you want:  encrypt, sign, or
both encrypt and sign
<LI>SHTTP-Symmetric-Content-Algorithms if you need
very strong encryption algorithms
</UL>
<P>

<UL>
<P><LI>In most cases, you want to accept the default

Consider the following before choosing PKCS-7 or PEM:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>PKCS-7 is more flexible than PEM.
<LI>If you want clients outside the United States to encrypt messages
to you, they must use PKCS-7.
Also, U.S. export rules require that clients outside the United
States use RC2-CBC with a key range of 40-2 as the algorithm
to encrypt the content of the PKCS-7 message.
</UL>
<P><LI>Messages encrypted with PEM are always signed.
Make sure the options you choose for this header are consistent with
the options you choose for SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements.
For example,
if you specify orig-required=PEM or recv-required=PEM for this header,
do not specify orig-refused=sign or recv-refused=sign for
SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements.
<P><LI>If you want a client to encrypt requests to the server,
you need to make sure you have coded a DN for this anchor.
See 
<A HREF="#HDRDNANCH">"Specify the Distinguished Name of the server's certificate"</A> for more information on how to code DN.
Also, make sure you have sent the server's certificate to the client by
coding the CERTS tag or a server-side include in the
header of this HTML document.
See 
<A HREF="#HDRCERTS">"Code S-HTTP security in the header of your HTML document"</A> for more information on how to code the CERTS

</PRE>
<P>
<VAR>key size</VAR> can be:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>A range.  The maximum range is 128-2 for U.S and 40-2 for export.
For example:
<PRE>
RC2-CBC&#91;40-2&#93;
</PRE>
<LI>A single number.  The single number can be from 2 through
128 for U.S.-Canadian and from 2 through 40 for export.
For example:
<PRE>
RC2-CBC&#91;40&#93;
</PRE>
<LI>40, which is the default
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
The greater the key size, the stronger the encryption.
You might want to specify a range to allow negotiation of the
strongest encryption.
However,
if the server is an export version or if some clients are outside
the U.S., you need to
require the RC2-CBC algorithm with a key range of 40-2.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_701" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_701">Step 3. Coding CRYPTOPTS in protection setups and ACL files</A></H2>
<P>
You use
protection setups to protect one or more files in one or more
directories based on URLs.
You use ACL files to limit access to one or more
files in a directory.
<P>
You can code CRYPTOPTS for protection setups and, optionally, for
ACL files.
These CRYPTOPTS are very important.
Remember:
<UL>
<P><LI>The server does not know what CRYPTOPTS were specified
in the anchor coding.
The server only knows what CRYPTOPTS the client is using and
what CRYPTOPTS the client is capable of using based on what the
client sends in its request for the document.
<P><LI>All vendors'
clients may not handle the CRYPTOPTS in an anchor the same way.
</UL>
Therefore, the only way you can ensure the server enforces the security
you want is to code CRYPTOPTS in protection setups and,
optionally, in ACL files.
<P>
Instructions on how to code protection setups and ACL files begin
at 
<A HREF="icswg008.html#HDRACTPROT">"Step 1. Activating protection"</A>.
<P>
You need to make sure the CRYPTOPTS you code for protection setups
and ACL files are consistent with the CRYPTOPTS you code for
the document referenced in an anchor.
If they are not, the server won't serve the document
even if the client has complied with the CRYPTOPTS
specified in the anchor.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_703" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_703">Step 5. Using S-HTTP</A></H2>
<P>
You're ready to use S-HTTP.
Before implementing it widely, you should test the S-HTTP
coding in your document to make sure you're getting the
security you want and need.
<P>
To test security, go to a browser and type the URL for
the HTML document with S-HTTP coding.
Click the anchors that have S-HTTP coding.
When the server serves the document,
check what security is being used.
For Secure WebExplorer, this information
is in the server certificate dialogue.
Select <B>Security</B>
from the menu bar, then click <B>Client
certificate</B> and then <B>Server certificate</B>.
<P>
After you've completed this testing,
look at the server's log files for errors.
<P>
When you're satisfied that you're getting the security you want,
you're ready to use S-HTTP.

If you want to set up a proxy server, see
<A HREF="icswg003.html#HDRPROXY">"Running your server as a caching proxy"</A> for information on how to set up your server

<P>
Secure WebExplorer clients can issue a URL using <B>shttp://</B> as
the transport mode.
Since there are no CRYPTOPTS and no DN, an Internet Connection Secure Server will
sign its response.
Other vendors' servers may not support clients issuing a URL
with the <B>shttp://</B> transport mode.

<H1><A NAME="HDROWNCA" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_704">Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network</A></H1>
<P>
To conduct commercial business on the Internet, you will want
to get a secure server certificate
from a widely known certification authority (CA),
such as VeriSign.
<P>
You may, however, have a project for your company,
university, or group where you want to act as your own CA for
a private Web network.
The Internet Connection Secure Server allows you to be your own CA.
As a CA, you will use a utility called certutil,
which is provided with the Internet Connection Secure Server, to create signed certificates.
<P>
<P><B>Note: </B>Your use of this utility is limited to directly certifying end user
to end user exchange of data.  You are not authorized to issue
certificates to third parties or allow others to do so, or to use
this utility for any other purpose.
<P>
This chapter tells you how to become your own CA and then how to
process certificate requests as a CA.

<P>
Your job as CA is to verify that a certificate should
be issued for a client or server.
You need to make sure that the person making the request has
a legitimate claim to the name in the request.
For example, if your company is working on a top secret project,
you want to make sure the person requesting the certificate is
authorized to participate in the project.
<P>
After you have verified a person's claim, you will use
the certutil command to
process the certificate request.
The output from the certutil command is a certificate
signed with your CA private key.
<P>
After you verify that the information in the certificate
created by certutil is correct, you will:
<UL>
<P><LI>Send your CA certificate to the client or server for whom
you're acting as CA.
The client or server needs to receive your CA certificate and
designate it as a trusted root.
<P><LI>Send the client or server its certificate, which you processed
as a CA.
The client or server needs to receive its certificate into its key ring
after it has received the CA certificate and designated it as a
trusted root.
</UL>
<P>
Before you can process certificate requests as a CA, you need to do the
following to become a CA:
<UL>
<P><LI>Create your CA public-private key pair and request a
CA certificate
<P><LI>Receive your CA certificate (which is the same as the CA certificate
request) into your CA key ring
<P><LI>Designate your CA key as a trusted root
</UL>
<P>
You must carefully protect your CA private key.
If it is compromised, then all the certificates you've issued
will also be compromised.

<P><B>Specify Key Name</B>:
Specify a meaningful, unique name to identify your CA key pair.
The key name is the label that identifies
the key pair and certificate in the key ring.
You may use non-alphanumeric characters in key names; however,
keep in mind that some platforms have special uses for some of
these characters.
<P><B>Specify Key ring</B>:
Specify the fully qualified path and file name for the key ring file.
It's best to use a separate key ring to keep your CA key pair.
If you specify a file that doesn't exist for key ring, the
server creates the file for you.
<P><B>Specify the Size of the Key Pair</B>:
Your private CA key will be used to sign the server and client
certificates you process as CA.
Your CA public key will be used by those clients and servers to
verify your CA signature.
The larger the CA key pair, the more secure the key pair will be.
If the CA private key is compromised, then all the certificates issued by
the CA are also compromised.
<P><LI><B>Specify a Password</B>:
Use this part of the form to specify the password that protects
your CA key ring.
You should keep your CA keys in a separate key ring
with its own password.
If your CA private key is compromised,
then all the certificates you've issued
as a CA are also compromised.

<P>
<P>
The security of your CA private key, which is used to sign the
client and server certificates you process as a CA, depends
upon this password.
Here are some commonly accepted rules for specifying passwords:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Make the password at least six characters.
<LI>Make sure the password doesn't spell a word.
<LI>Make sure the password doesn't consist of publicly
obtainable information about
you; for example, the initials and birth date for you, your spouse,
or children.
<LI>Include at least two, nonconsecutive numbers in the password.
</UL>
<P>
Type the password twice to ensure that you have typed
it correctly.
<P>
If you must record the password, make sure it is stored in a
well-secured place.
<P>
If, as recommended, you put your CA key pair on a separate key
ring, do <B>not</B> check <B>Automatic
Login</B> to stash the password for the CA key ring.
<P><LI><B>Specify Distinguished Name</B>:
Specify the Distinguished Name you want associated with your
CA certificate and used to identify your CA public key.
<P><BR>
<B><BR><IMG SRC="icsl0b11.gif" ALT="* Figure icsl0b11 not displayed."><BR></B><BR>
<P>
Provide the following information for Distinguished Name:

Now, you are ready to process the certificate request for clients and
servers.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRPROCCA" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_709">Processing certificates as a CA</A></H2>
<P>
After you have created your CA key pair, obtained your CA certificate,
and designated your CA public key as a trusted root, you are ready
to act as a CA and process certificates
for this server and for other servers and
clients.
<P>
Servers can use the Configuration and Administration forms
to create their public-private key pair and request their
certificate.
They should use the Other Certificate form.
If you provide them with your e-mail address, they can specify
it on the form and have the certificate request electronically
mailed to you.
Or, they can save the certificate request in a file and
electronically mail it to you later.
<P>
Clients can use KeyManager to create their public-private
key pair and request their certificate.
They can use either the persona or secure server certificate requests.
They can save the certificate request in a file and
electronically mail it to you.
<P>
Some e-mail programs may alter files and should not be used
to send or receive certificate requests or certificates.
For example, some programs may pad the lines of the certificate
request or certificate with blanks and invalidate it.
<P>
To process certificates for clients and servers, you will:
<UL>
<P><LI>Receive certificate requests from clients and servers and verify
that the person making the request has a legitimate claim to the
name in the request.
<P><LI>Use the certutil command to process the certificate request.
The output
from the certutil command is a certificate signed with your CA private
key.
<P><LI>Check the information printed in the output file and verify
to whom the certificate is being issued before sending it
to the client or server.
<P><LI>Send the client or server:
<UL>
<P><LI>Your CA certificate.  This certificate must be received into the
key ring of the client or server and then designated as a trusted
root.
<P><LI>The client or server certificate that was processed by you as CA.
After the client or server has received the CA certificate into its
key ring and designated it as a trusted root, the client or server
can receive its certificate into the key ring.

<P>
This chapter describes how to use the
server's commands.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="HDRCERTUTL" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_727">certutil command</A></H2>
<P>
For a secure server,
use the certutil command to process certificate requests for the clients
and servers for whom you're acting as a Certificate Authority (CA).
The output of the certutil command is
a client or server certificate that has been
signed with your private CA key.
<P><B>Note: </B>How to become your own CA and how to process certificate
requests as a CA is described in 
<A HREF="icswg012.html#HDROWNCA">"Acting as a certification authority for a private Web network"</A>.
You should follow the step-by-step instructions in that chapter
unless you are familiar with the procedure.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_728">Syntax</A></H4>
<P>
<PRE>
certutil &#91;-p <VAR>validity-period</VAR>&#93; &#91;-k <VAR>ca-key-ring</VAR>&#93;
 &lt; <VAR>cert-req-file</VAR> &gt; <VAR>cert-file-name</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
<P><B>Note: </B>The certutil command should be on one line.
It is shown on more than one line because of formatting.
<P>The &lt; and &gt; symbols, redirect the standard input and
standard output.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_729">Flags</A></H4>
<DL>
<P><DT>-p <VAR>validity-period</VAR>
<P><DD>Validity period in days of the certificate to be issued.
Acceptable values are from 1 to 9999.
If you omit this flag, the default validity period is 365 days.
<P><DT>-k <VAR>ca-key-ring</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies the fully qualified path and file name of the key
ring file containing your private CA key.
This is the name you specified as the CA <B>Key ring</B> on
the Create Key and Request Certificate form,
if you did not accept the default key ring file, keyfile.kyr.
If you omit this flag, the default keyfile.kyr is assumed.
<P><DT><VAR>cert-req-file</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies the fully qualified path and file name of the file that
contains the client or server certificate you are processing.
<P>
For clients or servers who mail their certificate request to
you through e-mail, it is the file into which you received the
certificate request with your e-mail program.
<P>
For a certificate request on the same server,
it is the file you specified for
<B>Save certificate request to file</B>
on the Create Key and Request Certificate form
when you were requesting the server certificate.
<P><DT><VAR>cert-file-name</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies the unique fully qualified path and file name
of the output file where you want to
put the certificate created by this command.
</DL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_730">Example</A></H4>
<P>
To create a certificate that is valid for two years:
<PRE>
certutil -p 730 -k D:/WWW/BIN/cakeyfil.kyr &lt; D:/WWW/BIN/CertReq.txt
  &gt; D:/WWW/BIN/Cert.txt
</PRE>
<P><B>Note: </B>The certutil command must be on one line.
It is shown here on more than one line
because of formatting restrictions.
<P>
After you enter the command, you are prompted for the key ring password.
This is the password for the key ring that holds the CA key.
<P>
If the certutil command cannot create the signed certificate,
it returns an error message.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRCGIPA" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_731">cgiparse command</A></H2>
<P>
Use the cgiparse command to parse the QUERY_STRING
environment variable for CGI scripts.
If the QUERY_STRING environment variable is not set, the command reads
CONTENT_LENGTH characters from its standard input.
All returned output is written to its standard output.
<P>
This corresponds to the GET and POST methods from HTML forms.
QUERY_STRING and CONTENT_LENGTH are environment variables.
For a GET request, QUERY_STRING holds the form data.
For a POST request, CONTENT_LENGTH is set and the form data is
sent on standard input.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_732">Syntax</A></H4>
<PRE>
   cgiparse <VAR>-Flag</VAR> &#91;<VAR>Modifier</VAR>&#93;
</PRE>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_733">Flags</A></H4>
<P>
Flags have one-character equivalents: -k -f -v -r -i -s -p -c -n -q
<DL>
<P><DT>-keywords
<P><DD>Parses QUERY_STRING for keywords.
Keywords are decoded and written to standard output, one per line.
<P><DT>-form
<P><DD>Parses input as form request.
Outputs one or more SET statements that set environment variables
beginning with FORM_ followed by a field name.
Field values are the contents of the variables.
<P><DT>-value <VAR>field-name</VAR>
<P><DD>Parses input as form request.
Prints only the value of <VAR>field-name</VAR>.
<P><DT>-read
<P><DD>Reads CONTENT_LENGTH characters from standard input and
writes them to standard output.
<P><DT>-init
<P><DD>If QUERY_STRING is not set, reads the value of standard input and
returns a SET statement that sets QUERY_STRING to this value.
This can be used with both the GET and POST methods.
A typical use is:
<PRE>
'cgiparse -init &gt; tempfile'
'CALL tempfile'
</PRE>
<P>
This will set the QUERY_STRING environment variable,
regardless of whether the GET or POST method was used.
<P>The cgiparse command may be called multiple times
in the same script when the GET method is used, but
it should only be called once if the POST method is used.
With the POST method, after standard input is read,
the next cgiparse would find standard input empty and would hang.
<P><DT>-sep <VAR>separator</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies the string used to separate multiple values.
If you are using the <B>-value</B> flag,
the default separator is newline.
If you are using the <B>-form</B> flag,
the default separator is a comma (,).
<P><DT>-prefix <VAR>prefix</VAR>
<P><DD>Used only with <B>-form</B>, specifies the prefix
to use when creating environment variable names.
The default is "FORM_".
<P><DT>-count
<P><DD>Used with <B>-keywords</B>,
<B>-form</B>, and <B>-value</B>,
returns a count of items related to these flags.
<DL>
<P><DT>-keywords
<P><DD>Returns the number of keywords
<P><DT>-form
<P><DD>Returns the number of unique fields (multiple values are
counted as one)
<P><DT>-value <VAR>field-name</VAR>
<P><DD>
Returns the number of values for <VAR>field-name</VAR> (if there is not
a field named <VAR>field-name</VAR>, output is 0).
</DL>
<P><DT>-<VAR>number</VAR>
<P><DD>Used with <B>-keywords</B>, <B>-form</B>,
and <B>-value</B>, returns
the specified occurrence related to these flags.
<DL>
<P><DT>-keywords
<P><DD>Returns the <VAR>n</VAR>'th keyword.
(For example <B>-2 -keywords</B> outputs the second keyword.)
<P><DT>-form
<P><DD>Returns all the values of the <VAR>n</VAR>'th field.
(For example <B>-2 -form</B> outputs all the values of the
second field.)
<P><DT>-value <VAR>field-name</VAR>
<P><DD>Returns the <VAR>n</VAR>'th
of the multiple values of field <VAR>field-name</VAR>.
(For example <B>-2 -value -whatsit</B> outputs
the second value of the <B>whatsit</B> field).
</DL>
<P><DT>-quiet
<P><DD>Suppresses all error messages.
(Non-zero exit status still indicates error.)
</DL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_734">Exit statuses</A></H4>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>0
</B><DD>Success
<P><DT><B>1
</B><DD>Illegal command line
<P><DT><B>2
</B><DD>Environment variables not set correctly
<P><DT><B>3
</B><DD>Failed to get requested information (for example,
there is no such field or QUERY_STRING contains
keywords when form field values are requested).
</DL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HDRCGIUT" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_735">cgiutils command</A></H2>
<P>
Use the cgiutils command in no-parse header programs
to produce a full HTTP 1.0 response.
<P><B>Note: </B> If you want to supply your own no-parse header (nph)
programs specifically to return your own return values,
the name of the program must begin with <B>nph-</B>.
This prevents the server header from overriding
your return value with the standard server return value.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_736">Syntax</A></H4>
<PRE>
   cgiutils <VAR>-Flag</VAR> &#91;<VAR>Modifier</VAR>&#93;
</PRE>
<P>If <VAR>Modifier</VAR> contains blanks, enclose it in quotes.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_737">Flags</A></H4>
<DL>
<P><DT>-version
<P><DD>Returns version information.
<P><DT>-nodate
<P><DD>Does not return the Date: header.
<P><DT>-noel
<P><DD>Does not return a blank line after headers.
This is useful if you want
other MIME headers after the initial header lines.
<P><DT>-status <VAR>nnn</VAR>
<P><DD>Returns full HTTP response with status code <VAR>nnn</VAR>,
instead of only a set of HTTP headers.
Do not use this flag if you only want the Expires: header.
<P><DT>-reason <VAR>explanation</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies the reason line for the HTTP response.
You can only use this flag with the <B>-status</B> <VAR>nnn</VAR> flag.
<P><DT>-ct &#91;<VAR>type/subtype</VAR>&#93;
<P><DD>Specifies MIME content type.
This example specifies a MIME content type of text/html:
<PRE>
   cgiutils -ct text/html
</PRE>
<P>If you omit the <VAR>type/subtype</VAR>,
the MIME content type is set to the default text/plain.
This example sets the MIME content type to text/plain.
<PRE>
   cgiutils -ct
</PRE>
<P><DT>-ce <VAR>encoding</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies content-encoding.
For example:
<PRE>
   cgiutils -ce  x-compress
</PRE>
<P><DT>-dl <VAR>language-code</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies content-language code.
For example:
<PRE>
   cgiutils -dl en_UK
</PRE>
<P><DT>-length <VAR>nnn</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies MIME content-length value.
<P><DT>-expires <VAR>Time-Spec</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies the time to live (the expiration date of a document)
in any combination of days, hours, minutes and seconds.
This is the length of time a document is considered valid.
For example:
<PRE>
   cgiutils -expires 2 days 12 hours
</PRE>
The cgiutils command adds the time you specify to the current
Greenwich Mean Time to determine the expiration date.
The expiration date is put
in the Expires: header in the HTTP format.
<P><DT>-expires now
<P><DD>Produces an Expires: header that matches the Date: header.
<P><DT>-uri <VAR>URI</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies the Universal Resource Identifier
(URI) for the returned document.
URI can be considered to be the same as URL.
<P><DT>-extra <VAR>xxx&#58;yyy</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies an extra header that cannot otherwise be specified
for cgiutils.
</DL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_738">Examples</A></H4>
<UL>
<P><LI>This example calculates the expiration date for the
Expires: header.
<PRE>
   cgiutils -expires "1 year 3 months 2 weeks 4 days 12 hours 30 mins"
</PRE>
<P><LI>The following example specifies a status code and reason, and
sets the Expire: header equal to the Date: header.
<PRE>
   cgiutils -status 200 -reason "Virtual doc follows" -expires now
</PRE>
This might produce headers similar to these:
<PRE>
   HTTP/1.0 200 Virtual doc follows
   MIME-Version: 1.0
   Server: IBM-ICS
   Date: Tuesday, 05-Jan-96 03&#58;43&#58;46 GMT
   Expires: Tuesday, 05-Jan-96 03&#58;43&#58;46 GMT
</PRE>
The cgiutils command automatically produces the Server: header
because it is available in the CGI environment.
The Date: field is also automatically generated
unless the -nodate flag is specified.
<P>
This would include a blank line after the output
to mark the end of the MIME header section.
If you want to follow this with some more headers yourself,
use the <B>-noel</B> (NO-Empty-Line) flag as shown in the
next example.
<P><LI>If you do not want the blank line after the header line,
use the <B>-noel</B> flag:
<PRE>
   cgiutils -noel -expires "2 days" -nodate
</PRE>
<PRE>
   HTTP/1.0 200 Virtual doc follows
   MIME-Version: 1.0
   Server: IBM-ICS
   Expires: Tuesday, 07-Jan-96 03&#58;43&#58;46 GMT

<H2><A NAME="HDRHTADM" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_739">htadm command</A></H2>
<P>
<P>
Use the htadm command to control your server password files.
Your server uses password files to control access to your files.
See 
<A HREF="icswg008.html#HDRPRT">"Protecting your server"</A> for information about controlling access to
your server&#39;s resources.
With htadm, you can add a user name to a password file, delete a
user from a password file, verify a user&#39;s password,
and create an empty password file.
You can also change a password for a user by first
deleting the user's password and then creating a new one.
<P><B>Note: </B>When you use htadm to add a user, change a password, or
verify a password, you must enter the password on the command line.
Because htadm destroys the password from the command
line as soon as possible, it is highly unlikely that you can see
a user&#39;s password by looking at the process listing on the machine
(with the pstat command, for example).

The command is used in conjunction with a map file.
Map files are text files that define regions within a graphics file
by their x,y coordinates and map them to the various URLs.
See the chapter on using images in your documents on our Web site
for additional information on using htimage and creating map files.
<P><B>Note: </B>Currently the universal image file accepted by all browsers and
servers is the GIF format.
GIF is an 8-bit 256 color image file.
<P>
You cannot use htimage from the command line.
You include it as part of an anchor tag within an HTML document,
and it is called when the server processes that document.
<P>
The htimage command is located in the
<B>CGI Bin scripts directory</B> you specified at installation.
The installation default is C&#58;\WWW\CGI-BIN.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_744">Syntax</A></H4>
<P>
Since htimage can only be called from an anchor tag within an
HTML document, the syntax is shown as HTML markup.
<PRE>
   &lt;A HREF="/CGI-BIN/htimage/<VAR>mapfile.txt</VAR>"&gt;
   &lt;IMG SRC="/ICONS/<VAR>image.gif</VAR>" ISMAP&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>
<DL>
<P><DT>
&lt;A HREF="/CGI-BIN/htimage/<VAR>mapfile.txt</VAR>"&gt;
<P><DD>
The HREF attribute of the anchor (A) tag specifies the URL
of the htimage command followed by the URL of the map file.
<P>
This syntax description assumes that the default configuration file
is being used.
The default configuration file contains
an Exec directive that maps requests beginning with
/CGI-BIN/ to the directory that contains the htimage command.
<P>
The server uses everything following /htimage/
as the URL of the map file.
If the server is using the default configuration and
the URL contains only a file name, the server would look
for the file in the document root directory.
<P><DT>&lt;IMG SRC="/ICONS/<VAR>image.gif</VAR>" ISMAP&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
<P><DD>
The SRC attribute of the image (IMG) tag specifies
the URL of the file that contains the graphic you want to
use as an image map.
<P>
The ISMAP attribute indicates that the graphic is an image map.
</DL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="Header_745">Examples</A></H4>
<P>
Following is a description of the map files
that must be used with the htimage command.
A map file is a text file.
Each line of the file is in the following format:
<PRE>
   <VAR>region-identifier</VAR> &#91;<VAR>region-definition</VAR>&#93; <VAR> URL</VAR>
</PRE>
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>region-identifier</VAR>
<P><DD>A keyword that identifies the type of region being defined.
Valid values are:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>rectangle
<LI>circle
<LI>polygon
<LI>default
</UL>
<P><DT><VAR>region-definition</VAR>
<P><DD>A set of numbers that defines a particular region of the graphic.
The format of the region definition is different
for each type of region.
<P>
Coordinates within parentheses identify a point
relative to the top left corner of the image.
The first number is the number of pixels
to the right of the top left corner.
The second number is the number of pixels down
from the top left corner.
There are several shareware programs available
that can help you easily identify the coordinates
of particular points within a graphic file.
<PRE>
default   <VAR>URL</VAR>
rectangle (<VAR>x1,y1</VAR>) (<VAR>x2,xy</VAR>) <VAR>URL</VAR>
circle    (<VAR>x,y</VAR>)   <VAR>r</VAR>       <VAR>URL</VAR>
polygon   (<VAR>x1,y1</VAR>) (<VAR>x2,y2</VAR>) (<VAR>x3,y3</VAR>) <VAR>URL</VAR>
</PRE>
<UL>
<P><LI>The <TT>default</TT> keyword
does not define a region.
The keyword is followed by a URL to link to
when the client clicks on a portion of the image map
that is not covered by any of the other region definitions.
<P><LI>For <TT>rectangle</TT>, the first point
is the upper left corner of the rectangle.
The second point is the lower right corner.
In other words, define any two diagonally
opposite corners having coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
<P><LI>For <TT>circle</TT>, the point is the center of the circle.
The single number following the point
is the radius of the circle as measured in pixels.
<P><LI>For <TT>polygon</TT>, up to 100 points can be defined.
The shape is formed by connecting the points in the order they are given.
The last point is connected to the first.
</UL>
<P>For example, you might use the following HTML in a document:
<PRE>
   &lt;A HREF="/cgi-bin/htimage/mapit.txt"&gt;
   &lt;IMG SRC="/icons/mapimage.gif" ISMAP&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>
<P>The above example calls the htimage command
with a map file named mapit.txt.
The mapit.txt file would define regions
of the mapimage.gif graphic file.
Because no path is specified for mapit.txt, the server would look for
it on the document root directory.
Following is an example of what mapit.txt might look like.
<PRE>
   default                                   /cgi-bin/go_home
   rectangle (50, 100) (200,200)             /cgi-bin/go_to_it
   circle    (100,300) 50                    /pub/example.html
   polygon   (450,350) (450,500) (150, 500)  /pub/triangle.html
</PRE>
<P>
One example of a shareware program for determining
the x,y coordinates is mapedit.
You can obtain mapedit from the following URL:

<H1><A NAME="HDRSHTNEG" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_749">Appendix B. S-HTTP negotiation</A></H1>
<P>
<A HREF="icswg011.html#HDRSHTTP">"Using Secure HTTP"</A> describes how to set up and use S-HTTP.
It provides an overview of S-HTTP, including how security
for a transaction is negotiated.
It also describes how to specify the cryptographic options
(CRYPTOPTS) that can be used for a transaction.
This chapter assumes you understand how S-HTTP works, especially
how CRYPTOPTS are specified.
<P>
The chapter summarizes how Internet Connection Secure Server and Secure WebExplorer negotiate.
<P>
S-HTTP is a message-based protocol that allows different CRYPTOPTS
for each transaction.
There are two negotiations for each transaction.
The first negotiation takes place when a user
clicks on an anchor that uses <B>shttp</B>
protocol mode.
If that negotiation is successful, the client sends a request
to the server, and another negotiation takes place between the
client and server.
This negotiation must be successful for the server to serve the
document.
<P>
For each of these negotiations, each CRYPTOPTS is negotiated
individually for both send and receive.
For example, for the SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements header, sign
would be negotiated for send and receive and encrypt would
be negotiated for send and receive.
<P>
If a CRYPTOPTS is not specified, the defaults are used.
<P>
In general, for SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements, the default for both
Secure WebExplorer and Internet Connection Secure Server is to encrypt.
However, for the client to encrypt, it must have the server's DN;
for the server to encrypt, it must have the client's certificate.
<P>
If the client does not have the server's DN or if the server does not
have the client's certificate and no CRYPTOPTS are specified, then
the client or server will sign.
<P>
On the other hand, if the client does not have the server's DN or
the server does not have the client's certificate, if some
CRYPTOPTS are specified, and if
the SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements header is not specified, then
the negotiation fails.
Although the default is to encrypt, the client cannot encrypt if it
does not have the server's DN, and the server cannot encrypt if it
does not have the client's certificate.
If the SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements header
is specified, it will override this
default behavior.
<P>
Following is a table that shows how the CRYPTOPTS are negotiated
if the client is Secure WebExplorer or the server is Internet Connection Secure Server.
<P>
For the negotiation that occurs when the user clicks on the anchor, one
side of the matrix represents the client's CRYPTOPTS
and the other
side represents the CRYPTOPTS coded in the anchor.
<P>
For the negotiation that occurs when the client requests the document
from the server, one side of the matrix represents the client's
CRYPTOPTS (the result of the anchor negotiation)
and the other side of the matrix represents the CRYPTOPTS
coded in the server's protection setups, ACL files, or both.
If CRYPTOPTS are coded in both the protection setups and the ACL files,
the CRYPTOPTS in the protection setups are negotiated first and then
the CRYPTOPTS in ACL files.
If either of these negotiations fail, the document will not be served.
<P>
<BR>
<PRE><TT>
+==================+==================+==================+==================+
| &nbsp;                | Required         | Optional         | Refused          |
+==================+==================+==================+==================+

| <B>Refused</B>          | FAIL             | NO               | NO               |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
</TT></PRE><P>
In this table:
<UL>
<P><LI>YES means that the CRYPTOPTS will be used.
<P><LI>NO means that the CRYPTOPTS will not be used.
<P><LI>FAIL means the CRYPTOPTS conflict, and the negotiation
will fail.
The document will not be requested or served.
If the document is not served, the server will send an error
message to the client.
<P><LI>COULD means that the CRYPTOPTS could be used.
However, as described later, you should require what you want,
refuse what you don't want, and accept optional (the default) only
if it doesn't matter how the CRYPTOPTS header is handled.
</UL>
<P>
After each CRYPTOPTS has been negotiated for both send and receive,
the client or server checks the resulting CRYPTOPTS to ensure they
are consistent and not contradictory.
(For example, if PEM is required for SHTTP-Privacy-Domains and
sign is refused for SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements, then the
CRYPTOPTS are contradictory because messages encrypted with PEM are
always signed.)
If the CRYPTOPTS are contradictory, then the negotiation fails.
If the CRYPTOPTS are not contradictory, then the negotiation succeeds,
and the client will send the request for the document or the server
will serve the document.
<P>
Other vendors' products may not handle negotiation the same way as
Internet Connection Secure Server and Secure WebExplorer.
That is why it is very important that you:
<UL>
<P><LI>Require the CRYPTOPTS that you want and refuse the CRYPTOPTS you
don't want.
Accept optional, or the default, only for a CRYPTOPTS
if it doesn't matter how the CRYPTOPTS is negotiated.
This is particularly important for the SHTTP-Privacy-Enhancements header.
<P><LI>Specify CRYPTOPTS on the server in protection setups, ACL files,
or both.
The server does not know what CRYPTOPTS were coded in an anchor.
The server only knows what CRYPTOPTS the client is using and is
capable of using, based on what the client sends in its request.
Therefore, you should use the CRYPTOPTS in protection setups and
ACL files to ensure that the server serves documents with the security
you want.

<H1><A NAME="HDRGLO" HREF="icswgmst.html#ToC_752">Appendix D. Glossary</A></H1>
<P>
This glossary defines terms used by the Internet Connection Server.
<DL>
<P><DT>accessory script
<DD>A CGI script program that processes SEARCH, POST, PUT, or DELETE
requests.  The accessory scripts process requests that are not explicitly
mapped to a CGI script program named on an EXEC directive.
<P><DT>address
<DD>The unique code assigned to each device or workstation connected to a
network.  A standard Internet address (or IP address) is a 32-bit address
field.  This field contains two parts.  The first part is the
network address;
the second part is the host number.   See also <I>IP address</I>.
<P><DT>alias
<DD>A name assigned to a server.  The alias makes the server independent
of the name of its host machine.  The alias must be defined in the domain
name server.
<P><DT>asymmetric keys
<DD>In secure communications, the two keys in a key pair.
The keys are called asymmetric because one key holds more of the
encryption pattern than the other does.
See <I>key pair</I>.
<P><DT>authentication
<DD>In secure communications,
a means of verifying the identity of a server or browser
(client) with
whom you wish to communicate.  A sender's authenticity is
demonstrated by the digital certificate issued to the sender.
See also <I>certificate</I>.
<P><DT>browser
<DD>A client program that initiates requests to a server and displays the
returned information.
<P><DT>cache
<DD>A special-purpose buffer storage, smaller and faster than
main storage, used
to hold a copy of data that may be frequently accessed.  Use of a cache
reduces access time, but may increase memory requirements.
<P><DT>caching proxy server
<DD>A proxy server that can store the documents it retrieves
from other servers
in a local cache.  The server can then respond to subsequent
requests for the
same documents without having to retrieve them from other servers.  This
can improve response time.
<P><DT>CERN
<DD>Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire (European Laboratory
for Particle Physics).
Located in Geneva, CERN initiated the World Wide Web, and was the first
to create a Web server.  The CERN Web server is the basis for many
commercially available servers, such as IBM's Internet Connection
servers.
<P><DT>certificate
<DD>In secure communications, a digital document
that binds an encryption
key to the identity of the certificate owner, so that the certificate
owner can be authenticated.
A certificate is issued by a certification authority (CA).
See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>certificate</I>, and
<I>certification authority (CA)</I>.
<P><DT>certification authority (CA)
<DD>In secure communications,
a trusted third party (such as VeriSign, Inc.) or a designated
internal authority who issues certificates.
See also <I>certificate</I>.
<P><DT>CGI (common gateway interface)
<DD>A standard interface between Web servers and external programs.  CGI
scripts are programs that use this interface to perform tasks not usually
done by the server, such as form processing.
<P><DT>CGI program
<DD>A program that uses the common gateway interface (CGI)
to perform tasks
not usually done by the server, such as form processing.
CGI programs can be written in any language supported by the operating
system on which the server is run.
The language can be a scripting language or a programming language.
<P><DT>client
<DD>A computer system or process that requests a service of
another computer
system or process.
For example, a workstation or personal computer
requesting HTML documents from an IBM Internet Connection Server
is a client of the IBM Internet Connection Server it connects to.
<P><DT>configuration file
<DD>A file that describes the devices, optional features, communications
parameters, and programs installed on a workstation.
For Internet Connection Server, the configuration file is named httpd.cnf and by default
is put in the
path specified on the SET ETC statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.
The configuration file
contains directives that define the various settings for the server.
<P><DT>default
<DD>A value, attribute, or option that is assumed when none is explicitly
specified.
<P><DT>directive
<DD>A statement used in the Internet Connection Server configuration file to define a
particular setting for the server.
<P><DT>directory
<DD>A named grouping of files in a file system.
<P><DT>Distinguished Name
<DD>In secure communications,
the name and address of the person and organization to whom a
certificate has been issued.
See also <I>certificate</I>.
<P><DT>document root directory
<DD>The primary directory where a Web server stores accessible documents.
When the server receives requests that do not point to
a specific directory, it tries to serve the request from this
directory.
<P><DT>domain
<DD>In an internet, a part of the naming hierarchy.
A domain name consists of a
sequence of names (labels) separated by periods (dots).
<P><DT>domain name
<DD>A name of a host system in a network.  A domain name consists of a
sequence of names (labels) separated by periods (dots).
<P><DT>domain name server
<DD>A server program that supplies address-to-name
translation by mapping Internet addresses to
domain names.
Use of a domain name server allows
users to request services of another computer using a symbolic name,
which is easier to remember than an Internet address.
<P><DT>dotted-decimal notation
<DD>The syntactical representation for a 32-bit integer that
consists of four 8-bit
numbers, written in base 10 and separated by periods (dots).
It is used to
represent IP addresses.
<P><DT>encryption
<DD>In secure communications,
a means of scrambling data to prevent the data from being read by
anyone other than the intended recipient.  The sender uses a key to
encrypt the message; the recipient uses the decryption key.
See also <I>key</I> and <I>key pair</I>.

<DD>An application protocol used for transferring files to and from host
computers.  FTP requires a user ID, and a password to allow
access to files on a remote host system.
<P><DT>gateway
<DD>A functional unit that connects a local data network with
another network.
See also <I>proxy gateway</I>.

that provides a
menu-driven interface for accessing files and information on other
computers.
<P><DT>home page
<DD>The welcome page on
the document root directory of a Web server.
Commonly used as the
entry point for the contents of the server.
See also <I>welcome page</I>.
<P><DT>host
<DD>A computer, connected to a network, which provides
an access point to that
network.  A host can be a client, a server, or a client and server
simultaneously.
<P><DT>host name
<DD>A name, such as tcpipidd.raleigh.ibm.com, that is defined for an IP
address, such as 9.67.97.103.
<P><DT>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
<DD>A language used to create hypertext documents.
Hypertext documents can
include links to other related documents.
HTML controls the format of text
and position of form input areas, for example,
as well as the navigable links.
<P><DT>HTML document
<DD>A document written in HTML that may
contain links to other documents that
contain additional information about related terms or subjects.
<P><DT>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
<DD>The protocol used to transfer and display hypertext documents.

consisting of an
image, image background, and a label.
<P><DT>Internet
<DD>A wide area network connecting thousands of disparate networks in
industry, education, government, and research.  The Internet network uses
TCP/IP as the standard for transmitting information.
<P><DT>IP address
<DD>The unique 32-bit address that specifies the actual location
of each device or
workstation in the Internet.  For example, 9.67.97.103 is an IP address.
<P><DT>key
<DD>In secure communications,
an algorithmic pattern used by a sender to encrypt messages,
and by a recipient to decrypt messages.
See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>key pair</I>, and
<I>key ring</I>.
<P><DT>key pair
<DD>In secure communications,
a public key and a private key.  The sender uses the private key
to encrypt the message; the recipient uses the public key to decrypt
the message.  Because the private key holds more
of the encryption pattern than the public key does, the key
pair is called asymmetric.
See also <I>public key</I> and <I>private key</I>.
<P><DT>key ring
<DD>In secure communications,
a file that contains public keys, private keys, trusted roots, and
certificates.
See also <I>public key</I>, <I>private key</I>,
<I>trusted root</I>, and <I>certificate</I>.

Name servers translate
symbolic names assigned to networks and hosts into the Internet (IP)
addresses used by machines.
<P><DT>path
<DD>A statement that indicates where a file is stored on a
particular drive.  The
path consists of all the directories that must be opened to
get to a particular
file.  The directory names are separated by the backslash (\).
<P><DT>password
<DD>In secure communications, a string of characters that you use
to protect access to your key ring.
See also <I>key ring</I>.
<P><DT>port
<DD>An end point for communication between applications,
generally referring to
a logical connection.  A port provides queues for sending
and receiving data.
Each port has a port number for identification.  When the port number is
combined with an Internet address, it is called a socket address.
<P><DT>private key
<DD>In secure communications,
an algorithmic pattern used to encrypt messages that can be
decrypted only by the corresponding public key.  A private key is
also used to decrypt messages that were encrypted by the corresponding
public key.
You keep your private key on your own system in a key
ring, protected by a password.
See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>public key</I>, and
<I>key ring</I>.
<P><DT>protection setup
<DD>A group of protection subdirectives that
work together to define how the server should control access to
the resources being protected.

in separate protection setup files, or by using the
Configuration and Administration forms.
<P><DT>protocol
<DD>The set of rules governing the operation of functional units of a
communication system if communication is to take place.  Protocols can
determine low-level details of machine-to-machine interfaces, such as the
order in which bits from a byte are sent; they can also determine
high-level
exchanges between application programs, such as file transfer.
<P><DT>proxy gateway
<DD>A type of firewall that protects computers in a business network
from access
by users outside that network.  See also <I>firewall</I>.
<P><DT>proxy server
<DD>A server that can retrieve documents from other servers for
its clients.
<P><DT>public key
<DD>In secure communications,
an algorithmic pattern used to decrypt messages that were
encrypted by the corresponding private key.  A public key is
also used to encrypt messages that can only be decrypted by
the corresponding private key.
You broadcast your public key to everyone who will
need to exchange encrypted messages with you.
See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>private key</I>, and
<I>key ring</I>.
<P><DT>README file

to clients, such as current date, the file's last modification date,
and the size or last modification of other files.
<P><DT>S-HTTP
<DD>Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
S-HTTP is a popular security protocol that is a security-enhanced
variation of HTTP proposed by Enterprise Integration Technologies
(EIT).
S-HTTP allows servers and clients to authenticate each other
and agree on the kind of security they will use in transmissions.
See also <I>authentication</I> and <I>SSL</I>.
<P><DT>SSL
<DD>Secure Sockets Layer.
SSL is a popular security scheme developed by Netscape Communications
Corp., along with RSA Data Security, Inc.
SSL allows the client to authenticate the server and all
data and requests to be encrypted.
The URL of a secure server protected by
SSL begins with https (rather than http).
See also <I>authentication</I> and <I>S-HTTP</I>.
<P><DT>subdirectory

<B>Welcome to the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research (NTL-LTER) site home page.  This page is meant to provide scientists and the general public with NTL-LTER site information and rapid access to our online datasets.  The National Science Foundation established the LTER Program to support research on long-term ecological phenomena in the United States.  We have <A HREF="sitemap.html"><B>two study regions in Wisconsin</B></A>:  the Trout Lake Region located near Boulder Junction and the Madison Lakes Region located near Madison.  These regions encompass a wide range of northern temperate lakes in glacial landscapes in urban, agricultural and forested watersheds.  Within each region, we consider a suite of adjacent lakes that share a common climate but differ dramatically in their physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. We employ a long-term perspective that permits us to examine both spatial and temporal variability and to evaluate the implications of such variability for community and ecosystem processes.  </B>

<A NAME="setting"><H2>RESEARCH SETTING</H2>
</A>
Our Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) research on north temperate lakes extends beyond the traditional boundaries of ecosystem studies to encompass multiple temporal and spatial scales.  We consider a suite of adjacent lakes that share a common climate but differ dramatically in their physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.  We employ a long-term perspective that permits us to place analyses of seasonal and annual patterns into the broader context of year-to-year variability and to evaluate the implications of such variability for community and ecosystem processes.  We use a nested series of spatial scales ranging from within individual lakes to the entire Northern Highland Lake District.  This permits us to consider how processes occurring in a lake are related to factors in adjacent systems and the surrounding landscape.<P>

Lakes provide ideal systems for long-term ecological research.  Their boundaries are relatively distinct, and adjacent lakes, although sharing a common setting, may differ greatly in their fundamental properties.  Thus, comparisons of lakes can be used to isolate at least partially important control factors for lake processes.  Their distinct boundaries make lakes particularly useful for analyses of landscape-scale patterns.  Likewise, many in-lake processes operate on shorter time scales than their analogs in terrestrial habitats (e.g., population growth and succession).  This facilitates the observation of repeated sequences of processes within a few years as well as experimental manipulations.  These advantages are coupled with a long tradition of limnological work--a substantial amount of which was conducted on our LTER lakes in the first half of this century--which has laid the groundwork for our research.<P>

<H3>Site Characteristics</H3>

The Northern Highland Lakes District, with an area of approximately 10,000 sq. km, has one of the highest concentrations of lakes in the world.  Within Vilas County alone, where our LTER site is located, there are over 1,300 lakes, covering 16 percent of the surface area.  Within a 10-km radius of the Center for Limnology's Trout Lakes Station there are 68 named and 38 unnamed lakes.  Lakes range in size from 0.1 to over 1,500 ha, in depth from 1 to 33 m, and in fertility from oligotrophic to eutrophic.  Other representative limnological conditions include: rainwater dominated, groundwater dominated and drainage lakes; dystrophic lakes; lakes with varved sediments, winterkill lakes, temporary and permanent forest ponds, and reservoirs.  Lakes are influenced by strong seasonality and are usually ice covered from late November to late April.  The district is also the source area for several major river systems.  The county surrounding the station has approximately 640 km of permanent streams and numerous intermittent streams.<P>

Lakes within the Northern Highland exhibit near-natural water quality conditions.  The Northern Highland and American Legion State Forests protect 80 percent of the land area and about two-thirds of the lake frontage.  Many lakes have totally forested watersheds and no private frontage.  There is no heavy industry and only a sparse population density.  Detailed investigations have indicated minimal effects of acid deposition on the lakes.  Outdoor recreation and forestry form the economic base for local communities.<P>

Climate is cool with a growing season of about 195 frost-free days.  The average annual temperature is less than 5 degrees Celsius.  The area receives approximately 76 cm of precipitation, about 30 percent of which falls in spring, with June and following summer months being the rainiest.  This area receives 127-152 cm of snow which covers the ground for about 120 days each year.<P>

Other research activities complement and are complemented by the LTER research.  First, other research at the Center for Limnology is extensive.  Also, the Station is within 15 km of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources' major warm water fish research site, the Five Lakes Experimental Fisheries Area, which has been collecting fisheries data continuously since 1946.  Finally, the Trout Lake Station lies in close proximity to the University of Notre Dame's Environmental Research Center.  Numerous activities at the two facilities are conducted in close collaboration.  Together the Trout Lake Station and the Notre Dame Center form a site within the Experimental Ecological Reserve Program.  In addition, cooperative work is underway with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.<P>

</H2></A><P>
<H3>Major Objectives
</H3>
Within the synthetic goal of understanding the ecological complexity generated by multiple processes acting over many temporal and spatial scales, we aim to develop a series of broad-scale evaluations of factors controlling lake processes.  These evaluations are interrelated but can also be considered independently.  They can be classed generally into five major objectives:<P>

<UL>
<LI>to perceive long-term trends in physical, chemical and biological properties of lake ecosystems;<P>
<LI>to understand the dynamics of internal and external processes affecting lake ecosystems;<P>
<LI>to analyze the temporal responses of lake ecosystems to disturbance and stress;<P>
<LI>to evaluate the interaction between spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of lake ecosystems; and<P>
<LI>to expand our understanding of lake-ecosystem properties to a broader, regional context.<P>
</UL>

	The first four objectives have played a key role in our research over the past five years; the last objective is new.  Conceptual extensions within the first four objectives include (1) a focus on global climate change, (2) expanded evaluations of microbial processes, and (3) more detailed assessments of land-water interactions.<P>

<H3>Approach to Questions
</H3>
<B>Perceptions of Long-Term Trends:</B>  Our goal has been to develop a set of ecological measurements that will allow investigators to observe and analyze patterns of long-term change in the physical, chemical, and biological features of lake ecosystems.  Long-term measurements at various ecological levels and several temporal and spatial scales are intended to capture the structure and function of lake ecosystems and enable analyses of interactions among the principal ecosystem components.  We established a date management system to make modern and historic data easily available to researchers.<P>

We have focused on a suite of lakes and surrounding terrestrial areas linked through a common groundwater and surface water flow system that share common climatic, edaphic, and biogeographic features.  Our seven primary lakes (Trout, Big Muskellunge, Allequash, Crystal, Sparkling, and Trout and Crystal Lake Bogs) located within 5.3 km of the Trout Lake Station in north central Wisconsin, were chosen to represent marked differences in size, morphometry and habitat diversity, in thermal and chemical features, in species richness and assemblies, and in biological productivity.<P>

The choice of primary lakes makes groundwater one major focus of our project, because of its importance in regulating differences in the chemical composition of lakes and in linking terrestrial and lake ecosystems.  We also have secondary lakes for comparison with the primary lakes on specific research questions of individual investigators.  The two most important are Little Rock Lake, the site of a USEPA-funded experimental acidification, and Lake Mendota, the site of a Wisconsin DNR-funded, whole-lake biomanipulation experiment.  Lake Mendota, our only study lake outside of the northern Highland area, is included also because of its rich historical data, including 145 years of ice-cover data to analyze climatic patterns.<P>

We sample most major physical, chemical and biological parameters.  Sampling frequency is tuned to the dynamics of individual parameters.  Sampling is most intense at spring overturn, maximum stratification in summer, fall overturn, and winter stratification.  Nutrients, pH, inorganic and organic carbon are sampled monthly.  Temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, primary productivity, and zooplankton abundance are measured every two weeks during the open water season and every five weeks under ice cover.<P>

Parameters that vary over longer time scales are measured annually in August.  These include macrophyte distribution, fishes (abundance, biomass, and community structure) and benthic invertebrate abundance.  In addition, groundwater levels in selected wells are measured monthly and groundwater chemistry is measured quarterly.  Parameters measured at our automated land-based weather station include air and soil temperature; precipitation; longwave, shortwave, and photosynthetically active radiation; wind speed and direction; and relative humidity.  Our raft-based station on Sparkling Lake records air and water temperature, wind speed at three elevations, and relative humidity.<P>

<B>Dynamics of External & Internal Processes:</B>  Long-term patterns in lakes are generated by a complex interplay between the external and internal processes we study.  Because internal and external processes operate on a variety of time scales, interactions among them lead to complex patterns, often with time lags between cause and event.  Understanding how lakes are affected by the interaction of processes occurring on different time scales, particularly when there are time lags, is a major goal of our LTER program.  External processes being studied include climatic and hydrologic factors combined with land-water interactions.  Climate exhibits substantial year-to-year variation and distinct long-term cyclic behavior.  Hydrologic differences among NTL LTER lakes are associated primarily with differences in groundwater inputs.<P>

These differences exert important influences on both water and chemical budgets.  Land-water interactions involve linkages between terrestrial and aquatic systems in which numerous processes operate at fundamentally different time scales (contrast the growth and decomposition of trees versus phytoplankton).  For an example of internal processes, a lake's primary production during midsummer is controlled directly by the extent of turnover during the previous spring and by the amount of grazing exhibited by herbivorous zooplankton during that period.  Each of these processes in turn is linked with longer-term factors such as external nutrient loading and the year-class strengths of zooplanktivorous fishes.<P>

<B>Responses to Disturbance & Stress:</B>  Our efforts have emphasized acid deposition and species invasions of rainbow smelt and rusty crayfish.  Our work has considered the role of turnover events as disturbances in plankton communities.  Using a series of temporary ponds at the NTL LTER site, we also have tested explicitly the hypothesis that the importance of biotic interactions in determining community structure increases with the extent of time between disturbances.<P>

<B>Spatial & Temporal Variability:</B>  We consider multiple scales of spatial and temporal variability and interactions not only between spatial and temporal variability, but also between perceptions of variability and scale of observation.  Variability is a characteristic of all ecosystems, yet there is little understanding of how systems differ in variability patterns, or what factors lead to these differences.  Remote sensing and geographical information systems allow us to sample and analyze different systems at the same spatial scale.  Use of these tools can be particularly powerful in analyses of landscape structure of diverse systems.<P>

Temporal variability arises through the interplay between internal dynamics and fluctuations in external driving forces.  Spatial heterogeneity may interact with temporal variability in determining community and ecosystem features.  Spatial heterogeneity may decrease the connectedness of a system and act as a buffer against disturbance or alternatively may prevent the re-invasion of a species lost after a disturbance.<P>

<B>Broader Spatial Scales:</B>  Of particular interest is the issue of how to make useful predictions across scales.  We wish to scale-up from the seven LTER lakes to the Northern Highland Lake District to assess: (1) how well we can transfer our understanding of processes within the LTER lakes to a larger region, (2) regional impacts of global change, (3) regional diversity, and (4) effects of regional changes in conservation, forestry, land development, and recreation policies.<P>

Problems of scale have always been part of ecology.  We do not believe that simply extrapolating across scales will be an effective means of predicting across scales.  For example, analyses of satellite and acoustic remote sensing scenes makes clear that interesting differences result when the natural world is viewed at different scales.  We examined the distribution and morphometry of our lakes from the grain of a Landsat TM image (30 m) to that of an AVHRR image (1 km).  Information was lost at the coarser grain which is important to the interpretation and evaluation of a lake district.  Many features are only observable at the finer scales (97 percent of the lakes disappear between the 30-m and the 1-km scales) and significant bias develops in the parameterization of the objects of interest.<P>

In many ways we face the same dilemma as molecular biologists using their methodology to predict the behavior of communities of organisms or as population ecologists using their methodologies to predict the function of organ systems.  For the present, it seems clear that (1) structural analyses must be conducted across scales at least until we obtain a better understanding of how our view of the natural world is affected by scale of observation; and (2) we must develop sets of appropriately scaled models to cover a range of spatial grains and extents.  To address the second problem, we will develop a spatially explicit regional hydrologic model and a model predicting chlorophyll concentrations and water color of lakes from landscape features.<P>
<H3>Site Research Results</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Ice duration over a 142-year period on Lake Mendota demonstrates a decrease in ice cover at the end of the little ice age and shorter durations in El Nino years over the last 50 years.  In addition, the last 10 years show a decrease in ice duration, which when simulated into the future for a doubling of greenhouse gases, results in occasional winters without ice cover.<P>
<LI>Sparkling Lake's water budget was estimated by stable isotopic techniques to be one-third of the total input and transports 19,000 kg/year of road salt into the lake from an adjacent state highway.<P>
<LI>Sediment cores and spong spicule sizes were used to estimate trends in lake silica concentrations over the last 10,000 years; dissolved silica concentrations have decreased four-to tenfold, indicating significant decreases in silica loading and perhaps the weathering rates of the tills.<P>
<LI>Annual carbon 14 primary production was remarkably similar in Crystal, Sparkling and Trout Lakes even though the three lakes differ significantly in position in the groundwater flow system and in nutrient and solute loadings.  Small differences in dissolved organic carbon (dissolved color) appear to be sufficient to reduce light penetration in the lakes lower in the groundwater flow system to compensate for their higher fertility.<P>
<LI>An invasion of rainbow smelt in Sparkling Lake has caused the virtual extirpation of the once abundant native zooplanktivore, cisco, in the eight-year period since the invasion, apparently owing to the predation of smelt on eggs and young of the cisco.<P>
<LI>The experimental acidification of Little Rock Lake has demonstrated that many biological effects on the ecosystem are indirect, occur at least a year after the decrease in pH, and are mediated through interactions in the food web.<P>
<LI>The position of a lake in the landscape can be used to predict the inherent variability of limnological parameters.  Lakes higher in the landscape had higher inter-year variability than lakes lower in the landscape especially in edaphic properties.<P>
<LI>Lakes with similar exposure to climate (similar area to mean depth ratios) were more temporally coherent among years than lakes that differed the most in exposure to climate.  Also, variables most closely related to climate, such as water level, were most coherent among lakes, while biological factors such as perch year class strength and chlorophyll biomass demonstrated no inter-lake coherence among years.  Each lake had a unique behavior for these biological variables.<P>
<LI>Spatial heterogeneity in littoral zone fish assemblages was essentially the same among lakes, among sites within a lake and among samples at a site.  The community structure appears to be "fractal."  The spatial heterogeneity in a lake was best explained by the spatial heterogeneity in the habitat rather than the species diversity in the lake.<P>
</UL>

<H3>Intersite Research Results
</H3>
The ease with which comparisons and common analyses can be accomplished among LTER sites which differ greatly from each other is contributing to a new synthesis and level of generalization in the LTER Network.  Example results of intersite analyses with which we have been associated follow:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Measures of temporal (among years) and spatial (among locations at an LTER site) variability in LTER sites may provide a metric for ecosystem comparisons that is not parameter or ecosystem specific.  Analyses of LTER data at an intersite workshop indicated that ecosystems as diverse as deserts, forests, streams and lakes have common features in variability.  For example, the biological features are more variable than are the edaphic and climatic features regardless of ecosystem type.  Important differences are also apparent; deserts have greater temporal variability than lake districts but lower spatial variability.<P>
<LI>Landscape position was a significant predictor of temporal variability at locations within four LTER sites studied (forest stream, desert, estuary, and lake district).  Specific mechanisms relating spatial position to variability differed at the four LTER sites, but at each site (1) locations differed in annual variability, (2) for at least a subset of parameters, this variability was related to position in the landscape, and (3) water movement across the landscape was the important underlying factor determining variability patterns.<P>

<A NAME="future"><H2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</H2>
</A>
Research at the North Temperate Lakes LTER site is continuing on our set of primary questions, but is evolving to an increased focus on global climate change, an expanded evaluation of microbial in-lake processes, and a more detailed assessment of land-water interaction at a lake and regional scale.  Specific questions related to these foci are listed below.<P>

<H3>Climate Change</H3>

	One of our long-range goals is to predict changes in limnological processes due to global climate change.  This involves three steps in which we (1) develop models of the influence of climate on thermal conditions within lakes, (2) predict the impacts of warming scenarios on lake conditions, and (3) examine the effects of predicted thermal conditions on internal lake processes.  This work will be regionalized through cooperative research with the USGS through simulations with a regional hydrologic model.  Some of the questions we will be addressing are:<P>

<UL>
<LI>What is the relationship between climatic factors and thermal conditions in lakes?<P>
<LI>How will thermal structure of lakes change following global climate warming?<P>
<LI>How will inlake processes respond to global climate warming?<P>
<LI>How will climate-associated changes in water levels and thermal regimes influence patterns of colonization and extinction?<P>
<LI>How will global change affect water table and lake levels, lake-connectedness, and the relative percentages of land, lakes and wetlands?<P><P>
</UL>

<H3>Microbial Inlake Processes
</H3>
	Our results to date indicate the influence of several factors in controlling the production of our study lakes.  Evaluations of the interplay of these factors remain to be completed.

<UL>
<LI>What is the role of nutrient loading to the photic zone in controlling primary production among lakes differing in groundwater inflow?<P>
<LI>To what extent does the proportion of primary production processed by zooplankton and the microbial food web vary among lakes?<P>
<LI>What is the role of phosphorus immobilization by iron in limiting production in the NTL region?<P>
</UL><P>
<H3>Land-Water Interactions
</H3>
The NTL LTER site is a mosaic of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems where terrestrial systems have the potential to exert major influences on lake conditions.  Such terrestrial influences operate directly through the input of allochthonous materials and indirectly through an influence on hydrologic inputs.  Characteristics of terrestrial ecosystems surrounding lakes, and their potential influence on lakes, vary as a function of soil substrate and natural and/or human-mediated disturbance regimes.  Therefore, landscape position and disturbance regimes of terrestrial ecosystems must be considered in evaluating the factors influencing long-term patterns in aquatic ecosystems.  Expanded research here will focus on more detailed measures of the interaction between aquatic and terrestrial systems.

<UL>
<LI>How does terrestrial vegetation affect the hydrologic regimes of lakes?<P>
<LI>What are the relative effects of allochthonous inputs of coarse woody and fine litter material on dynamics of lakes?<P>
<LI>How do long-term changes in terrestrial vegetation influence lakes?<P>
<LI>Can a regional hydrologic model be developed as a synthetic tool for understanding terrestrial/aquatic interactions?<P>
