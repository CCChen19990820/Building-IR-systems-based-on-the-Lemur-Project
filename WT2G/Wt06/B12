On August 1st, 1938 over two hundred men and women belonging to several different labor unions attempted to peacefully demonstrate against the arrival of the SS Waialeale in Hilo. They were met by a force of over seventy police officers who tear gassed, hosed and finally fired their riot guns into the crowd, hospitalizing fifty of the demonstrators. This is the story of that bloody confrontation and the events that led up to what has come to be known in the annals of Hawaiian labor history as the Hilo Massacre.<P>

The account contained here is based largely on the press reports in the <em>Hilo Tribune Herald</em> and the <em>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</em>, interviews with over a dozen survivors and eye-witnesses, and a new, critical evaluation of the report to Governor Poindexter by Attorney General Joseph V. Hodgson made possible by the author's recent discovery in the State Archives of Hodgson's original case files. [97 pages]<P>

<A NAME = "CRA64"><strong>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000e-2.html">(42 U.S.C.
2000d-h)</A></strong><br> 
Title VII of the Act prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, national origin as well as religion and/or sex (but not including age or physical disability discrimination).  This title applies to all employers, employment agencies, apprenticeship programs and labor unions whose activities affect interstate commerce, including state and local governments and
including Americans working abroad for US-based employers.  To be covered an employer must have 15 or more employees for each working day of 20 or more weeks in the current or prior year.<P>

Though not excluded from all the other forms of discrimination, under section 702 religious corporations, associations, educational institutions and societies are exempt with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the institutions' activities.<P>

The defenses to unlawful employment practices under this title include: bona fide occupational qualifications based on religion, sex, or national origin (BFOQ); a bona fide seniority, merit or incentive system, not intended to discriminate; reasons of national security; and actions and measures taken against Communists.  Enforcement is in the hands of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Hawai'i Civil Rights Commission (HRCC) whose laws and proceedures have been determined to be substantially equivalent to those of the EEOC.<P>

The law requires that claims be filed first with the EEOC or HRCC.  Although the 1972 amendments gave the EEOC power to seek judicial relief directly, most judicial
action takes the form of private suits in federal district court (usually non
jury trials) seeking injunctions, backpay, remedial seniority and attorney's
fees.  Before a suit can be filed in federal district court, the EEOC must issue
the claimant a right to sue letter.  This may be requested anytime after 180
days have passed since the original complaint to the EEOC was filed.<P>

The EEOC does not have authority to file suit against governmental agencies. If
the charged party is a state or local government body and conciliation fails,
the EEOC refers the case to the United States Attorney General.<P>

The EEOC has the same investigative authority under Title VII as the NLRB has
under the LMRA, which means it has broad access to documentary evidence and of
summoning witnesses and taking testimony.  And it may seek the assistance of the
U.S. district courts in compelling the production of evidence and the attendance
of witnesses.<P>

Federal employees are required to seek administrative relief within their own agency through designated EEO counselors first, but there is a 180-day time limit for agencies to investigate.  The EEOC may review agency investigations,
and complainants have the right to a hearing before an EEOC administrative law
judge on request when appealing an agency's determination.</a><P>

<strong><A NAME ="SexHar">Sexual Harassment Regulations</strong><br>
<blockquote>Sexual Harassment: The unwanted imposition of sexual requirements in
the context of a[n employment] relationship of unequal power.<p> -Catherine
MacKinnon.</blockquote>

According to EEOC Guidelines [29 CFR 1604.11; FR Nov. 10, 1980]:<BR>
(a) Harassment on the basis of sex in violation of Sec. 703 of Title VII and HRCC rules [HAR 12-46-109];
unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, and other verbal or
physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1)
submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or
condition of an individual's employment, (2) submission to or rejection of such
conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting
such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive working environment. ...<P>

(c) Applying general Title VII principles, an employer, employment agency, joint
apprenticeship committee or labor organization (hereinafter collectively
referred to as 'employer) is responsible for its acts and those of its agents
and supervisory employees with respect to sexual harassment regardless of
whether the specific acts complained of were authorized or even forbidden by the
employer and regardless of whether the employer knew or should have known of
their occurrence. ...<P>

(d) With respect to conduct between fellow employees, an employer is responsible
for acts of sexual harassment in the workplace where the employer (or its agents
or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct, unless it
can show that it took immediate and appropriate corrective action. ...<P>

(e) an employer may also be responsible for the acts of non-employees, with
respect to sexual harassment of employees in the workplace where the employer
(or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the
conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. ...<P>

(f) Prevention is the best tool for the elimination of sexual harassment. An
employer should take all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from
occurring, such as affirmatively raising the subject, expressing strong
disapproval, developing appropriate sanctions, informing employees of their
right to raise the issue of harassment under Title VII and Part I, HRS 378, and developing methods
to sensitize all concerned.<P>

(g) Other related practices: Where employment opportunities or benefits are
granted because of an individual's submission to the employer's sexual advances
or requests for sexual favors, the employer may be held liable for unlawful sex
discrimination against other persons who were qualified for but denied that
employment opportunity or benefit.</a><P>

<HR SIZE = 6>
<strong><A NAME ="HEPA">Hawai'i's Employment Practices Act, HRS 378 & HRS
368:</strong><br>
The chief federal anti-discrimination statute is the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-h). Title VII of this law prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, national origin as well as religion and/or sex. In addition, the <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/ch14.html">
Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967</A> (ADEA)
prohibits discrimination on the basis of age against employees or job applicants over the age of 40 years, and the <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/ch126.html">
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</A> (ADA) protects persons with disabilities from discrimination. These laws are enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Hawai`i Civil Rights Commission (HCRC) through a work-share agreement.<P>

Hawai'i enacted its own employment rights law in 1963 (HEPA) to safeguard employment rights of individuals by making certain 'employment practices' illegal.<P>

HEPA covers all employers in the State except the federal government. Part I (Discriminatory Practices) is administered by the State's Civil Rights Commission.  Parts II and III are administered by the Enforcement Division of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (the main office is in Honolulu for O`ahu residents; there are branch offices in Hilo, Kona, Wailuku and Lihue for neighbor island residents).</a>
<P>
<strong><A NAME ="Part1">Part I: Unlawful Employment Discrimination</strong><br>Part I makes unlawful actions taken or not taken because of or in relation to: race, sex, age, religion, color, ancestry, disability, marital status, sexual orientation or arrest and court record, assignment of income for child support obligations, and National Guard participation.<P>

'Arrest and court records' include any information about an individual who has been questioned, apprehended, charged with an offense, served a summons, arrested with or without a warrant, tried, or convicted pursuant to any law or military authority.  
"Because of sex" includes, but is not limited to, issues of sexual harassment at the workplace, pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.<P>

It is unlawful discrimination under the Part I for an employer to refuse to hire, employ, bar or discharge, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual in compensation or in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.  Likewise, employment agencies may not classify or refuse to refer or otherwise discriminate or advertise in a way that expresses, directly or indirectly, any limitation, specification, or unlawful discrimination.  Nor may a labor union
exclude or expel from its membership or refuse to enter into an apprenticeship agreement with anyone (16 years or older) in a discriminatory manner.<P>

Like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Part I of HEPA has several limitations or exceptions.  It allows (1) bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ's); (2) termination or discharge for reasons relating to the ability of the individual to perform the work in question; (3)  religious, charitable or educational institutions to give preference to individuals of the same religion; (4) and certain employers such as schools and financial institutions to consider related criminal convictions.  However, the burden of proof falls upon the employer to demonstrate the appropriateness of these exceptions to their particular situation.<P>

The Hawai`i Employment Practices Act does not have the same minimum employee requirements found in the federal law, and covers employers with one or more employees.  The time limit to file a charge with the Civil Rights Commission is 180 days.  This time period starts from the commission of an alleged discriminatory act.  A complainant should not wait until after a grievance or other
internal procedure is completed before filing with the Commission.<p>

Like Title VII, HEPA provides for issuance of right-to-sue letters if the investigation determines tere is no violation ("no cause"), no
settlement or conciliation agreement is reached.  But it also permits the Commission to seek relief which may award backpay and compensatory damages. Itcan also award punitive damages where there is clear and convincing evidence that the employer acted wantonly, oppressively, willfully or with malice.

Hawai`i Civil Rights Commission:<BR>
On O`ahu call 586-8640<BR>
From Neighbor Islands, call 1-800-468-4644 (ext 68640)<BR>
<p>
Hawai`i Civil Rights Commission (HCRC) Claim Filing:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>A complaint must be filed within 180 days of the occurrence of the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice or the last occurrence in an on-going pattern of unlawful discriminatory practices. </li>
<LI>The HCRC must serve a copy of the complaint or a notice thereof on the respondent within 10 days.</li>
<LI>Within 180 days of the filing of the complaint the HCRC must conclude its investigation and determine whether there is 'reasonable cause' to believe that an unlawful discriminatory practice has been committed, provided that the
commission may grant an extension of the period for investigation.</li>
<LI>During this investigatory period, a HCRC officer may require the parties to
attend a fact-finding conference.  The officer may encourage the parties to
agree to a written predetermination settlement approved and signed by the HCRC.</li>
<LI>Where it is unable to eliminate the alleged unlawful discrimination
informally, the HCRC shall issue a final conciliation demand that the respondent
cease the unlawful practice(s) within the 180-day investigation period which may
be extended by the HCRC.</li>
<LI>If, 15 days after the service of the final conciliation demand, the HCRC finds that conciliation has not resolved the complaint, the HCRC shall appoint a hearings officer. </li>
<LI>Within 30 days after appointment, the Hearings Examiner shall order the holding of a scheduling conference to plan for the hearing.  Following the hearing the Hearings Examiner shall issue a written proposed decision either dismissing the case or ordering the employer to cease the unlawful practice, and awarding an appropriate remedy</li>
<LI>This proposed decision is forwarded to the five-member, Governor-appointed, Commission Board who can accept/reject/modify the Hearings Examiner's proposed
decision and issue a final order with appropriate remedies.</li>
<LI>Any time after the filing of the complaint but no later than three days
after the conclusion of the scheduling conference, the complainant may request,
in writing, a "right to sue" notice.  Within 90 days after the receipt of such a
notice from the HCRC, the complainant may file a civil suit against the employer
in circuit court.</li>
</UL>

In 1992, the Act was amended to allow employees who are victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault an exemption from the 180 day statute of limitations for filining with HCRC, providing two years to bring civil action against their employers for sexula harassment or sexual assault and the resultant infliction of emotional distress and/or invasion of privacy.</a><P>

<strong><A NAME ="Part2">Part II: Polygraphs/Lie Detectors</strong><br>
Part II of HEPA makes it unlawful for a private employer or his/her agent, or an
agent of a public employer to require an employee to submit to a polygraph or
lie detector test as a condition of employment or to continue employment.  Any
person who unlawfully requires employees to submit to polygraph or lie detector
tests may be fined not more than $1000.00 or imprisoned not more than one year,
or both.</a><P>

<strong><A NAME ="Part3">Part III: Garnishee protection</strong><br>
Part III makes it unlawful for any employer to suspend, discharge or
discriminate against any of his/her employees solely because the employer was
summoned as a garnishee where the employee is the debtor (in a bankruptcy
proceeding); or because the employee suffered a work injury compensable under
the Workers' Compensation Law unless the employee is no longer capable of
performing his/her work as a result of the work injury and the employer has no
other available work which the employee is capable of performing.  By law an
employee, who is discharged because of inability to perform the work available,
must then be given first preference of re-employment by the employer in any
position which the employee is capable of performing and which becomes available
after the discharge until the employee secures new employment.<P>

PROCEDURES: A written complaint must be filed with the Enforcement Division,
Department of Labor & Industrial Relations.  For unlawful suspension or
discharge, the complaint must be filed within 30 days after action; except that
in cases relating to work injury, the 30 day clock begins to toll from date
employee is able to return to work.</a><P>

<A NAME = "Part4"><strong>Part IV: Duty of Fair Represenation</strong><br>
Part IV relates to the obligation of a labor organization to provide fair
representation to its members.  This Part, enacted in 1980, provides:  HRS
&#167;378-51 Action against labor organization, limitation.  Any complaint, whether
founded upon any contract obligation or for the recovery of damage or injury to
persons or property, by an employee against a labor organization or its alleged
failure to fairly represent the employee in an action against an employer shall
be filed within 90 days after the cause of action accrues, and not
thereafter.<P>

Where the alleged failure to fairly represent an employee arises from a
grievance, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue when an employee
receives actual notice that a labor organization either refuses or has ceased to
represent the employee in a grievance against an employer.  Where the alleged
failure is related to negotiations or collective bargaining, the cause of action
is deemed to accrue when applicable collective bargaining agreement or amendment
thereto is executed.</a><P>


<strong><A NAME ="Part5">Part V: Hawai`i's Whistleblowers' Protection
Act</strong><br>
Part V: Hawai`i's Whistleblowers' Protection Act: In 1987 the Hawai`i State
Legislature enacted a law to protect the employment rights of workers who report
their employers for any violations of law.  Passed as Act 267 this law went into
effect on June 24th, 1987, and has since been codified as Part V of the State's
Employment Practices Act (HRS 378).  The Act covers private sector workers as
well as state and county employees and applies to employers and their agents
with one or more employees.  It provides that employers shall not discharge,
threaten, or otherwise discriminate against an employee because: 
(1) the employee, or a person acting on behalf of the employee, reports or is
about to report to a public body, verbally or in writing, a violation or a
suspected violation of a law or rule of the State, County, or the United States,
unless the employee knows that the report is false; or (2) An employee is
requested by a public body to participate in an investigation, hearing, or
inquiry held by that public body, or a court action.<P>

A person who alleges a violation of this chapter may bring a civil action for
appropriate injunctive relief, or actual damages, or both within ninety days. 
The court may order reinstatement of the employee, payment of back wages, full
reinstatement of fringe benefits and seniority rights, actual damages, or any
combination of these remedies.  A court may also award the complainant all or a
portion of the costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees and
witness fees.</a><P>

<A NAME ="OSHA"><strong>OSHA & Hawai'i Occupational Safety and Health Law, HRS
396</strong>
[and Title 12, Chapters 50 through 2250, Administrative Rules]<p>

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a branch of the U.S.
Department of Labor, was created by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of
1970 <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/651.html">(Chapter 15 of 29 U.S.C.  651-678; P.L. 91-596)</A>, to provide for adoption
and enforcement of work safety and health standards throughout the United
States.  The Act allowed for state-run programs which were at least as effective
as the federal program.<P>
Since1984,  federal OSHA formally relinquished its standards and enforcement
authority in areas covered by the Hawai`i program except for federal workers. 
Administration and enforcement of the Law are the responsibility of the
Occupational Safety and Health Division of the State Department of Labor,
formerly known as DOSH but now referred to as HIOSH.<P>

<strong>GENERAL DUTIES</strong>
Every employer is responsible for providing safe employment and a safe working
place for his or her employees.  He or she must furnish and use safety devices
and must adopt and use safe practices.  Further, an employer may not discharge,
suspend or otherwise discriminate against an employee who fails or refuses to
operate or handle unsafe equipment or who fails or refuses to engage in unsafe
practices in violation of the standards, regulations, citations or orders issued
under the authority of the law (HRS &#167;396-8).<P>

An accident prevention program tailored to meet the needs of the organization
must be established.  In addition, employers must keep records and post
information as provided by the Department.  The HIOSH poster 'Safety and Health
Protection on the Job' must be up throughout the year, while the Annual Summary
of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses must be posted during the month of
February.<P> 

The Hawai`i Occupational Safety and Health Law sets forth in general terms the
scope and purpose of the program, the areas to be regulated, the duties, powers
and organization of the enforcing agency, and the rights and responsibilities of
employers and employees.  The lengthy Administrative Rules are the detailed
provisions under which the Law is enforced.  They encompass the specific
measures that employers and employees must take to avoid accidents and illnesses
and to comply with the Law.<P>

<strong>COVERAGE</strong>
Coverage under Hawai'i's Occupational Safety and Health Law is extended to all
public and private employees, except those hired for domestic service in a
private home and those employed by a federal agency.  Included in the latter
category are employees in maritime activities, who are covered by the federal
Act, and employees in atomic energy activities, who are covered by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.<P>

In general, civilian employees of the federal government are covered by the
federal OSHA. Flight attendants and pilots, when they are in the aircraft, are
not covered by OSHA or HOSHL since the FAA preempts both of these statutes.<P>

<strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong>
Employees have the right to file complaints with the Department regarding unsafe
conditions and to participate in inspections.  In addition, these employees
cannot be discharged, suspended, or otherwise discriminated against for filing
complaints or for refusing to engage in unsafe practices. (HRS &#167;396-8)<p>

Compliance officers have the right to enter without delay any work place during
regular working hours and at other reasonable times.  Places of employment are
selected for routine inspection on a worse first basis, as determined by
workers' compensation injury and illness statistics.  Complaints by employees
can also initiate an investigation.  Advance notice of inspection may not be
given unless expressly authorized by the Director under extraordinary
circumstances.  (The compliance officer must, however, identify himself and
present his credentials to the person in charge of the establishment as soon as
he arrives at the company.)<P>

The Department also may investigate the cause of industrial injuries resulting
in disability or death and, subsequently, issue recommendations or orders.  Any
employer, owner, operator, agent or employee may be questioned privately during
investigations, inspections and enforcement activities.(HRS &#167;396-4 &
Administrative Rules)<P>

If an employer refuses to allow a compliance officer to enter or inspect the
place of employment, the Administrator may obtain a court warrant compelling the
employer to cooperate.<P>

When the Department finds an unsafe condition it may issue a citation, order or
notice directing the manner, abatement period, and changes required to correct
the hazard.  The employer must obey and observe all such directives and post
them in prominent places at applicable work sites within one business day of
receipt.<P>

If the Department finds conditions which constitute an imminent hazard to the
life or safety of any person, it may apply to the circuit court for an
injunction restraining the use of the operation until such operation is made
safe.<P>

Where a condition or practice could reasonably be expected to cause death or
serious physical harm, the Department has the right to immediately inform the
employees and employers of the hazard and to take steps to obtain immediate
abatement of the hazard by the employer.<P>

The maximum fine for violating the state HIOSHL is $7,000; and an employer
charged with a willful or repeated violation could be fined as much as
$70,000.<P>

HIOSHL distinguishes between four different categories of violation: serious,
willful, repeat, and general.<P>


<strong>MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETS</strong>
Chapter 203 in Part 8 of the regulations (&#167;12-203-7) requires chemical
manufacturers and importers to obtain or develop  Material Safety Data Sheets
(MSDS -OSHA form 174) for each hazardous chemical they produce or import and
employers to have a MSDS for each chemical they use.<P>

The MSDS must be in English and reveal all the ingredient(s), the chemical(s),
the common name(s); the physical and chemical characteristics and health hazards
including signs and symptoms of exposure, and any medical conditions which are
generally recognized as being aggravated by exposure to the chemical;
precautions for safe handling; emergency and first aid procedures.<P>

Copies of the MSDS must be readily accessible during each work shift to
employees when they are in their work areas and must be readily available, upon
request, to designated union representatives.<P>


<strong>STANDARDS</strong>
Like the federal OSHA, over the years HIOSH has developed detailed sets of
standards that must be adhered to.  Compliance with existing HIOSH standards is
required, but HIOSH may also enact temporary standards to address hazards not
otherwise covered.  Temporary standards remain in effect until superseded by
standards promulgated under Chapter 91 or for a maximum of six months.(HRS
&#167;396-4)<p>

<A NAME ="Testing"><strong>Substance Abuse Testing, HRS 329B</strong><br>
In 1990, the State enacted this law to require certain minimum standards be followed by employers who have chosen to subject their workers to drug or substance abuse testing. Testing must be done by licensed laboratories in the State of Hawai'i or, if out of state, by labs licensed under comparable standards. The director of DOH sets the licensing standards which govern procedures, methods, Chain of Custody, etc.  The law also provides that persons, prior to being tested, must be provided with a written statement of the substances being tested for and a warning that some over-the-counter medications and prescription drugs may cause a false positive test result and a medication disclosure form. Failure of the lab or the employer to comply with the provisions of the act invalidate the tests results. Willful violators may be fined between $1,000 and $10,000, payable to the aggrieved person.

<A NAME = "WC"><strong>Hawai'i's Workers' Compensation Act, HRS 386</strong><br>
Hawai`i's original Workers' Comp. law dates back to 1915, though it was
extensively revised in 1963.  Its primary objective was and is to provide medical, wage replacement and indemnity benefits to those sufferingwork-connected injury, illness, or death.<P>
This law is dministered by the Disability Compensation Division of the state's Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. <P>

State of Hawai'i Disability Compensation Division:<br>
On O`ahu call 586-9161<BR>
State Dept. of Labor District Offices:<BR>
On Maui call  243-5322<BR>
On Hawai'i call  933-4391<BR>
For West Hawai'i call  322-2775<BR>
On Kaua'i call  274-3351<BR>
<P>
The law requires all employers in the state to insure themselves either by purchasing a WC policy from a private insurance company or by qualifying for self-insurance as determined by the Department.
<P>
The law covers all employers employing one or more persons for any part of a day.  It includes public employers and their agencies, with the exception of federal employees who are covered by the <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/ch81.html">
Federal Employees
Compensation Act</A> (FECA).<P>

The reach of Hawai'i's law is substantial. An employee hired in the state while performing his/her duties, is covered. All contracts of hire are deemed to include an agreement to this effect. An employee hired out of state and injured in the performance of duties out of state and who is covered for workers' compensation under the law of the state where he/she was hired, may enforce a claim with the Director of Labor.<P>

Workers' compensation is an exclusive remedy (HRS &#167;386-5).  Except for injuries or emotional distress inflicted by sexual harassment, the injured employee cannot sue the employer who provides compensation even if the employer's negligence caused the worker's injuries.  However, the injured employee retains his rights to sue a third party who caused his/her injuries.<P> 

The primary advantage of the Hawai`i WC law is that an employee is protected by certain presumptions (HRS &#167;386-85).  In the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary it is presumed:  1)  that the claim is for a covered work injury; 2)  that sufficient notice of such injury has been given; 3)  that the injury was not caused by the intoxication of the injured employee; and 4) that the injury was not caused by the willful intention of the injured to injure himself or another.<P>

<strong>BENEFITS:</strong>
<UL>
<LI>All medical care, services, and supplies as the nature of the injury requires, for as long as required.</li>
<LI>All necessary aids, appliances, apparatus, and supplies to cure or relieve the effects of the injury including repairs thereto or replacement thereof due to ordinary wear and tear, or damage due to subsequent compensable injury or accident.</li>
<LI>Service of an attendant as need is determined by the Director of Labor.</li>
<LI>Weekly income payments (wage replacement) from fourth day of disability at a rate representing two-thirds of injured's average weekly wage but not more than the maximum weekly benefit amount annually set by the Department of Labor. This benefit is commonly know as TTD-- temporary total disability.</li>
<LI>Weekly income payments at same rate as for TTD for permanent total disability (PTD)</li>
<LI>Additional payment for permanent partial disability (PPD) at 2/3 of the average weekly wage of the injured for the number of weeks set forth in the schedule.</li>
<LI>Additional one time, lump sum payment for disfigurement caused by or resulting from the injury, not to exceed $30,000.</li>
<LI>Payment of death benefits and compensation for dependents.</li>
</UL>

Your weekly compensation for either a permanent or temporary total disability is set and fixed according to your wages or the maximum amount existing the year you were first injured.<P>

<strong>Maximum Weekly Benefit Amounts:</strong><BR>
<p>
<center>1986  - $299</center>
<center>1987  - $318</center>
<center>1988  - $334</center>
<center>1989  - $358</center>
<center>1990  - $383</center>
<center>1991  - $412</center>
<center>1992  - $437</center>
<center>1993  - $460</center>
<center>1994  - $481</center>
<center>1995  - $491</center>
<center>1996  - $496</center>
<p>

In other words, if you were injured in 1995 your weekly disability payments will either be two thirds of what were your average weekly wages or $491 which ever is less.<P>  

$491 is the equivalent of $12.27 an hour and this is what you would get weekly if your average weekly income had been $737.00 (that is $18.43 an hour) or more.<P>


<strong>COMPENSABILITY PRINCIPLES</strong><BR>
<UL>
<LI>The disability is compensable if the claimant has suffered personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment, or by disease proximately caused by or resulting from the nature of the employment.</li>
<LI>It is not compensable if the injury was caused by or resulted from employee's intoxication or wilful intent to injure oneself or another.</li>
<LI>Sequela and/or consequences are also compensable.</li>
<LI>Aggravation (or 2nd injury), if it too is job related, will be compensated
at the later (usually higher) disability rate than for just a Recurrence.</li>
</UL>

<strong>BASIC CLAIM FILING REQUIREMENTS:</strong><BR>
If you are injured you should first report the injury or disability to your employer or immediate supervisor. It is then your employer's responsibility under the law to file a WC-1 form report with the State DLIR Disibility Compensation Divivision accepting or denying liability. The employer must do this within seven days of your notice if there was lost time or the injury required medical care beyond ordinary first aid.  Additionally the employee needs to tell his or her doctor of the claim so that the doctor will file a report on Form WC-2 with the Department of Labor.<P>

Notice of injury should be given as soon as possible, but the employee's claim must be filed with the Department of Labor within two years from the date at which the effects of the injury or disability first became manifest and five years from the accident (longer in the case of certain toxic or carcinogenic
exposures). <P>

If the employer or the insurance carrier denies liability or refuses to pay the required benefits, the employee must file a WC-5 form with the Disability Compensation Division of Department of Labor who will render a decision as to the compensability of the claim.<br>Important Note: Denial of a claim by the employer or the insurance carrier should not be confused with a denial by the Department of Labor.<p>

<strong>The WC-5 form:</strong>
<UL>
<LI>On the line for INSURANCE CARRIER you should write the name of the employer's Workers' Comp. Ins. carrier not your personal medical or health insurance company.</LI>
<LI>On the line for INJURY give as closely as possible the exact date and time of the accident or of the time you were exposed to the disease. This time will usually be during your work time.  Remember, everything you write on this form will be used to support or challenge your claim that this is an injury or disability arising out of and in the course of your employment.</LI>
<LI>Where it asks 'Reason for filing,' if none of the blocks seem to apply, then it is always safe to write here: To establish my claim for compensation.</LI>
</UL>
Once the Department of Labor receives your completed WC-5 claim form they will hold it until the employer's WC-1 and the doctor's WC-2 come in and then they will schedule a hearing before a department hearings officer.<P>

<strong>APPEALS:</strong><BR>

Any party disagreeing with the decision of the Department of Labor & Industrial Relations, may file an appeal within twenty days with the LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD, a three member, full-time Board appointed by the Governor of the
State.<P>

If the Director of Labor, the Appellate Board or any Court finds that
proceedings under the workers compensation law have been brought, prosecuted,
or defended without reasonable ground the whole costs of the proceedings may be
assessed against the party who has brought, prosecuted, or defended the
proceedings.<P>

The SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI`I is the final judicial review panel.
Appeals from decisions of the Appeals Board are heard by the Court on the record
compiled at the Appeals Board.<P>


<strong>PHYSICIANS:</strong><br>

Physician, as defined by the statute, includes: doctors of medicine, dentists, chiropractors, osteopaths, naturopaths, psychologists, optometrists, and podiatrists.<P>

Workers' Compensation pays for all medical care, services and supplies as the nature of the injury reasonably requires, including physical rehabilitation services; all necessary aids, appliances, apparatus, and supplies to cure or relieve the effects of the injury, including repairs thereto or replacement thereof due to ordinary wear and tear, or damaged due to subsequent compensable
injury or accident; services of an attendant as need for same is determined by the Director of Labor; and vocational rehabilitation services, including tuition, books, travel, and maintenance expenses while enrolled in the vocational rehabilitation program.<P>

The injured worker has the right of free choice of physician.  Switching doctors or 'doctor hopping', however, is discouraged.  If the claimant changes a doctor more than once, such change is subject to the approval of the department (DLIR-DCD).  On the other hand, Workers' Comp does cover the cost of specialists, therapists, etc. to whom the injured worker is referred by his or her treating physician.<P>

As provided in HRS &#167;386-79, after an injury and during the period of disability, the employee, <strong>whenever ordered by the director</strong> of the State Department of Labor & Industrial Relations, must submit to examination at reasonable times and places by the employer's physician.  The employer's physician can only examine the worker and not treat or prescribe medicine or any other treatment.  On the other hand, if the employee in anyway obstructs such an examination, the employer may suspend payment of benefits with the approval of the director of the Deprtment of Labor.<P>

On August 1st, 1938 over two hundred men and women belonging to several different labor unions attempted to peacefully demonstrate against the arrival of the SS Waialeale in Hilo. They were met by a force of over seventy police officers who tear gassed, hosed and finally fired their riot guns into the crowd, hospitalizing fifty of the demonstrators. This is the story of that bloody confrontation and the events that led up to what has come to be known in the annals of Hawaiian labor history as the Hilo Massacre.<P>

The account contained here is based largely on the press reports in the <em>Hilo Tribune Herald</em> and the <em>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</em>, interviews with over a dozen survivors and eye-witnesses, and a new, critical evaluation of the report to Governor Poindexter by Attorney General Joseph V. Hodgson made possible by the author's recent discovery in the State Archives of Hodgson's original case files. [97 pages]<P>

<P>
The story of labor relations in Hawai'i's hotel industry is a chronicle of the dynamic relationship between powerful business and political interests on the one hand and a growing struggle between two rival unions on the other.<P>

This study is both a history of these relationships and, to a lesser extent, a critique of both the industry and unionism, including the impact in recent years of foreign investment.<P>

Though it is a history, Stern's work is focused on the future of the industry, which, he argues, cannot be viewed as separate from the future of the Hawaiian economy. And most importantly, the book evaluates, as objectively as possible, the effect of "dual unionism" on the interests of the 30,000 plus hotel workers throughout Hawai'i.<P>

Bernard (Bernie) W. Stern had been professionally active in labor relations for well over 50 years. He headed Benefit Plan Consultants, a company that designed and supervised health and pension plans for labor and management groups. On the mainland, he was a negotiator and researcher for the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union and later a labor economist for the National Labor Relations Board. In Hawaii from 1962-1965 he was an assistant to Art Rutledge. After twenty years as a consultant and mediator to Hawai'i's labor community, he retired and began writing labor history. His first book, <A HREF = "book2.html">Rutledge Unionism</A> (1986), described labor relations in Honolulu's transit industry. He died May 4, 1988, shortly after completing work on this study which was published posthumously in 1989. [140 pages]<P>

<P><CENTER><FONT size=5>Aupuni i La'au<br>A History of Hawai'i's Carpenters Union Local 745<FONT size=3>

<P>
<em>Aupuni i La'au</em> (1993) is the history of Local 745 of the Carpenters Union, the sixth largest union in the State of Hawai'i, and the largest local of its international. The title comes from the Hawaiian translation of Robert A. Christie's classic history of the International Carpenters Union, <em>Empire in Wood</em>.<P>

Solidly rooted in the local community, Local 745 has played an important role in the democratization of Hawai'i's politics first led by the late Jack Burns. The local had the good fortune to benefit from the merits of two totally different leaders with diverse leadership styles. Stanley Yanagi and Walter Kupau were each uniquely suited to the challenges of their respective eras; this history is a compelling account of how the union flourished under their administrations. In the past ten years, for instance, despite a decline in union membership nationally, Local 745 has nearly doubled its size.<p>

Edward D. Beechert, Professor Emeritus at the University of Hawai'i, taught labor and economic history at the Manoa campus until his retirement in 1988. The author of <em>Working in Hawaii: A Labor History</em>, he has achieved here a study of Local 745 which is comprehensive and revealing and, at the same time, is very readable. Beginning with the earliest records of the conditions and status of carpenters in the islands, he takes us through the long road Hawai'i's carpenters have travelled to their present-day benefits and privileges.

<A NAME ="UINSURANCE"><strong>Unemployment Insurance, HRS 383</strong><br>
Officially known as the Hawai`i Employment Security Law, this law requires
employers to pay taxes for each of their workers into an account from which
benefits are paid out to covered workers who become involuntarily unemployed. 
Some benefits paid to employees are charged to the employer's account or paid
out of the state's UI Trust Fund.<P>

<STRONG>Hot Link to State DLIR Web-site:</STRONG>
 <A HREF ="http://www.aloha.net/~edpso/uitext.html">Unemployment Insurance Q & As</A>
<p>

To be eligible for UI benefits an unemployed individual must meet the following
qualifications:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Must file a claim with the state's UI division.</li>
<LI>Must register for work and report to the employment office as required</li>
<LI>Must be able and available for work unless claimant is ill or disabled after
filing the initial claim.</li>
<LI>Must have been unemployed for a one week waiting period, which period is not
compensable.</li>
<LI>Must meet the work and earnings test.  i.e. been paid wages during at least
two quarters in a designated base period, in each of which he/she worked at
least 2 days or 4 hours; and must have been paid wages in the base period of at
least 26 times the claimant's weekly benefit amount.</li>
<LI>Must not be a voluntary quit/resignation.*</li>
<LI>Must not have been discharged for misconduct connected with work. The
misconduct standard is not met by "mere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct,
poor performance because of inability or incapacity, isolated instances of
ordinary negligence or inadvertence, or good faith errors of judgement or
discretion." (&#167;12-5-51(c) Administrative Rules)</li>
<LI>Must apply for work and not refuse suitable employment without good cause.**</li>
<LI>Must not make a false statement or representation on the claim.</li>
<LI>Must not be receiving UI benefits from another state.</li>
</UL>

State of Hawai`i Unemployment Insurance Division:<br>
In Honolulu call 586-8970 or 586-8971<BR>
In Waipahu call 675-0030<BR>
In Kaneohe call 233-3377<BR>
On Maui call 243-5377<BR>
On Molokai call 553-3281<BR>
In Hilo call  933-4461<BR>
In Kona call 322-2724<BR>
On Kaua`i call  241-3485<BR>
<P>


The Weekly Benefit Amount is computed at 1/21 of the total of the claimant's
highest quarter wages in the base period, but may not exceed a state maximum. <P>
<strong><center>Maximum Weekly Benefit Amount for 1996 =$347</strong></center><P>
Benefits may extend for a maximum of 26 weeks and must be paid "promptly" in
accord with the decision of the UI Division, even when appeals (to Referee or
court) may be pending.  If the decision is reversed, benefits are discontinued. 
Claimants who receive benefits by mistake are liable for repayment unless the
overpayment was made without fault of the claimant or where recovery would be
against equity or good conscience.<P>


* Generally strikers are not eligible for UI benefits. However, the Department
has ruled that the disqualification only exists where the labor dispute has
caused or resulted in a work stoppage in which there is a 'substantial
curtailment of the business activities at the employer's establishment.'  Such
determinations are made on a weekly basis.<P>

State regulation (&#167;12-5-47) also provides that a voluntary separation may still
be eligible if resignation was for good cause, which may be found for the
following reasons:
<OL>
<LI>Change in working conditions and the change is prejudicial or detrimental to
the health, safety, or morals of the claimant;</li>
<LI>Change in conditions or terms of employment, including, but not limited to:
change in rate of pay, position or grade, duties, days of work, or hours of
work;</li>
<LI>Discrimination which violates federal or state laws regarding equal
employment opportunity practices;</li>
<LI>Change in employee's marital or domestic status;</li>
<LI>Acceptance of a definite, firm offer made of other employment where the
offer is substantially withdrawn and the former employer refuses to rehire the
employee;</li>
<LI>Retirement under a mandatory retirement imposed by a collective bargaining
agreement; or</li>
<LI>Any other factor relevant to a determination of good cause.</li>
</OL>

** The work is considered unsuitable when:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout or other
labor dispute; </li>
<LI>the wages, hours or conditions are substantially less favorable than those
prevailing for similar work in the locality; and </li>
<LI>if as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to
join a company union or to resign or refrain from joining any bona fide labor
organization (HRS &#167;386-30).</li>

Hawai`i's TDI law requires employers to provide reasonable compensation for wage loss to employees who become sick or disabled from non-work-related causes.  It is basically a legally required sick leave program to cover absences not otherwise covered by Workers' Compensation. To be eligible, an employee must have been in employment for at least 14 consecutive weeks during each of which he or she was paid for 20 hours or more and earned not less than $400 in the four completed calendar quarters before the disability. <P>

Disabled workers are entitled to 58% of their average weekly wage or a Maximum Weekly Wage Base (whichever is less) after a seven day waiting period for as long as 26 weeks.<P>

<strong><center>Maximum Weekly Benefit Amount for 1996 = $348</strong></center><P>

State of Hawai`i Disability Compensation Division for TDI:<br>
On O`ahu call 586-9188<BR>
State Dept. of Labor District Offices:<BR>
On Maui call  243-5322<BR>
On Hawai`i call  974-6464<BR>
For West Hawai`i call  322-2775<BR>
On Kaua`i call  241-3442<BR>
<P>

The details of the plan required by this law may be waived by the State Department of Labor (DLIR) if the employer can show evidence that the employer has a plan equivalent in over-all benefits, but in any case coverage must extend for at least two weeks beyond the termination of employment.<P>

A disabled employee needs to file a claim on the state TDI-45 form with the employer within 90 days after the beginning of the period of disability.
Benefits must be paid within 10 days from the date that proof of the claim was received.  The cost to provide TDI benefits may be shared by the employee provided that this share does not exceed one-half of total cost of the policy and/or .5 percent of the weekly wage base.<P>

In the event an employer denies a Workers' Compensation claim, it must pay out the TDI benefits due and seek reimbursement from the WC carrier in the event the DLIR declares the claim compensable later.</a><P>

<HR SIZE =6>
<strong><A NAME ="PHC">Hawai`i Prepaid Health Care Act, HRS 393</strong><br>
This law requires private sector employers to provide a minimum medical plan approved by the Director of the State Department of Labor (DLIR) and roughly equivalent to the benefits provided by HMSA Plan 4 or Kaiser Plan B.<P>

To be eligible an employee must work twenty or more hours per week for four consecutive weeks and earn a monthly wage of at least $86.67.<P>

The cost of providing PHC may be shared by the employee provided that this share does not exceed the lesser of one-half of total cost of the policy or 1.5% of the employee's monthly wages.  In the event an employee is disabled and unable to work, the employer is obligated to enable the employee to continue health care coverage by continuing the employer's share of the PHC premium cost for three months following the month during which the employee became disabled.  The employee must maintain the employee's portion of the premium payments<P>

As in TDI cases, in the event of a disputed Workers' Compensation claim, PHC must pay the medical expenses and await reimbursement from the WC carrier in the event the DLIR declares the claim compensable later.</a><P>


<strong><A NAME ="Quest">Med-Quest/Health Quest/SHIP, HRS 431N</strong><br>
In 1989, Hawai`i became one of the first states to establish a program to make medical insurance available to people with incomes too low to afford ordinary for-profit health plan. Known as SHIP, this law applies to so-called "gap group individuals" who are not poor enough to qualify for medicaid but do not qualify for prepaid health care insurance coverage through their employment. 
<p>In 1994 the State initiated 'Health Quest', a special five-year experimental project operating under a federal government waiver that permits the State to combine SHIP and Medicaid to provide managed-care coverage.  Qualified recipients can choose from among five plans provided by HMSA, Kaiser, Straub Care Quantum, and AlohaCare.  Now called "Med-Quest," the Department of Human Services is the coordinating agency.  For information on
eligibility requirements, Individuals or families on O`ahu should call
587-3521.</a><P>

<strong><A NAME ="DavisBacon">
Davis-Bacon Laws <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/40/276a.html">(Chapter 3 of 40 U.S.C. &#167;276 and HRS 104)</A></strong><br>
Davis-Bacon refers generally to laws which require contractors who bid for public works projects to pay their laborers the "prevailing wages."   Originally a federal law, it was named after its sponsors, Rep. Robert L. Bacon (a Republican from New York), and Sen. James J. Davis (a Republican from Pennsylvania and former Secretary of Labor). It was first signed into law in 1931 by President Herbert Hoover. <P>
<center><A HREF ="http://www.fedworld.gov/ntis/dbacon2.htm">NTIS Davis-Bacon Wage Determination Database</A></center>

<p>
In 1955 Hawai'i enacted its own "little Davis-Bacon" (HRS 104) extending coverage of the act to state and county construction projects as well.  Its purpose then, as now, was to prevent unscrupulous contractors from unfairly underbidding public projects, thereby doing violence to the wages prevailing in a geographical area.  Such contractors usually employed unskilled, underpaid and imported (often non-union) labor.  As the state's Report of the Senate's Labor Committee declared,<P>

<blockquote>This bill, like the Federal Davis-Bacon Act, has as its guiding principle that bids for construction of public works should be based on the relative skill and efficiency of the contractors concerned and not on a difference in wages paid.  To state the principle another way, government money, coming from the taxes of all of us, should not be used to subsidize contractors who are depressing the wages of some of us. (SCRep 318)</blockquote>

In Hawai'i it covers public construction projects costing more than $2000.00 and non-profit bidders on experimental and demonstration housing projects over $500,000.  It requires that prevailing wage rates be paid.  The prevailing wage is the basic hourly wage including the cost of fringe benefits commonly paid by employers in a local area.  For example, in Hawai'i the Director of Labor surveys unions and contractors throughout the state to calculate how much carpenters, painters and other classes of laborers are being paid.  Periodically a list of these determinations is published, and contractors are then required to base their bids on these wages for their workers.<P>

The laws, then, actually protect whatever is the prevailing rate of wages, whether union or non-union.  Any time the unions in an area end up with less than the minimum 30% of their jurisdiction organized, the law will work against them. The state law also requires contractors: (1) to submit weekly payrolls and records; (2) to maintain their own records for a period of at least three years; (3) and to give copies of the wage rates to each of their workers.<P>

The state law is enforced by the Enforcement Division of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.  A contractor found in second violation of the law can be levied a penalty of 10% of the contract amount, and for a third violation the contractor can be suspended from doing any work on any public work for a period of three years.  Workers who question whether they are receiving the prevailing wages as set by law should contact the Enforcement Division of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations for State and County projects or the Wage and Hour Division of the DOL.<P>

<strong><A NAME ="Walsh">The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/41/35.html">(41 U.S.C. &#167; 35-41)</A></strong><br>
Along the same lines as the Davis-Bacon Law, Walsh-Healey requires employers who have contracted with a government agency to manufacture or supply articles in any amount exceeding $10,000 to pay prevailing wages to the employees engaged in producing or finishing the contract articles.  The law also requires the contractors to maintain sanitary and nonhazardous working conditions and submit complete payroll records.  The government may sue contractors for liquidated damages or deduct amounts due from their contractual payments. Serious and willful violators of the act are subject to a "blacklist penalty" under which they are barred from receipt of federal contracts for a fixed period.<P>

<hr>
<strong><A NAME ="Service">The Service Contracts Act of 1965  <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/41/ch6.html">(41 U.S.C. &#167;351 et seq.)</A></strong><br>
Also known as the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contracts Act,  like Davis-Bacon and Walsh-Healey it is a prevailing wage law that applies to federally funded programs.  This act requires employers with service contracts for government agencies valued at more than $2,500 to pay prevailing wages and fringe benefits to the employees engaged in those contracts.  The government may sue contractors to recover unpaid wages or deduct amounts due from their contractual payments, and willful violators of the act are subject to a "blacklist penalty" under which they are barred from receipt of federal contracts for a fixed period.<P></a>

I'm a gross amateur at the guitar which I picked up -such as I could- in my college days in Pennsylvania.  I was weaned on the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Peter-Paul-&-Mary.  Later I came to Hawaii and fell in love with Hawaiian music which is so much richer and more beautiful than the usual "hapa-haole" tourist stuff that was all I had ever  heard back in the mainland. <P>
I love and play guitar for the sheer joy it gives me.  I only play in for others when I'm among friends who have had enough to drink that they won't notice my mistakes.<p>

(c)  Whenever a question arises concerning the representation of employees in a collective bargaining unit, the board shall determine the representatives thereof by taking a secret ballot of employees and certifying in writing the results thereof to the interested parties and to their employer.  There shall be included on any ballot for the election of representatives the names of all persons submitted by an employee or group of employees participating in the election, except that the board may in its discretion exclude from the ballot one who, at the time of the election, stands deprived of one's rights under this chapter by reason of a prior adjudication of one's having engaged in an unfair labor practice.  The ballot shall be so prepared as to permit of a vote against representation by any one named on the ballot.  The board's certification of the results of any election shall be conclusive unless an appeal is taken therefrom under this chapter.<P>

Where it appears by the petition that an emergency exists requiring prompt action, the board shall act upon the petition forthwith and hold the election requested within such time as will meet the requirements of the emergency presented.  The fact that one election has been held shall not prevent the holding of another election among the same group of employees, if it appears to the board that sufficient reason therefor exists.  In any election where the choices on the ballot do not receive a majority, a run off shall be conducted, the ballot providing for a selection between the two choices receiving the largest and second largest number of valid votes cast in the election.

<LI> To coerce, intimidate, or induce any employer to interfere with any of the employer's employees in the enjoyment of their legal rights, including those guaranteed in section 377-4, or to engage in any practice with regard to the employer's employees which would constitute an unfair labor practice if undertaken by the employer on the employer's own initiative;

<A NAME ="S9"><strong>&#167;377-9  Prevention of unfair labor practices.</strong> (a) Any controversy concerning unfair labor practices may be submitted to the board in the manner and with the effect provided in this chapter, but nothing herein shall prevent the pursuit of relief in courts of competent jurisdiction.<P>

(b) Any party in interest may file with the board a written complaint, on a form provided by the board, charging any person with having engaged in any specific unfair labor practice.  The board shall serve a copy of the complaint upon the person charged, hereinafter referred to as the respondent.  If the board has reasonable cause to believe that the respondent is a member of or represented by a labor union, then service upon an officer of the union shall be deemed to be service upon the respondent.  Service may be by delivery to the person, or by mail or by telegram.  Any other person claiming interest in the dispute or controversy, as an employer, an employee or their representative, shall be made a party upon proof of the interest.  The board may bring in additional parties by service of a copy of the complaint.  Only one complaint shall issue against a person with respect to a single controversy, but any complaint may be amended in the discretion of the board at any time prior to the issuance of a final order based thereon.  The respondent may file an answer to the original or amended complaint but the board may find to be true any allegation in the complaint in the event either no answer is filed or the answer neither specifically denies nor explains the allegation nor states that the respondent is without knowledge concerning the allegation.  The respondent shall have the right to appear in person or otherwise give testimony at the place and time fixed in the notice of hearing.  The hearing on the complaint shall be before either the board or a hearings officer of the board, as the board may determine.<P>

The board shall fix a time for the hearing on the complaint, which shall be not less than ten nor more than forty days after the filing of the complaint or amendment thereof, and notice shall be given to each party by service on the party personally or by mailing a copy thereof to the party at the party's last known post office address at least ten days before the hearing.  In case a party in interest is located without the State and has no known post office address within the State, a copy of the complaint and copies of all notices shall be filed in the office of the lieutenant governor and shall also be sent by registered mail to the last known post office address of the party.  Such filing and mailing shall constitute sufficient service with the same force and effect as if served upon a party located within the State.  The hearing may be adjourned from time to time in the discretion of the board and hearings may be held at such places as the board shall designate.<P>

In all proceedings under this chapter before the board, each member of the board may issue subpoenas and administer oaths.  Depositions may be taken in the manner prescribed by law.  No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, records, correspondence, documents, or other evidence in obedience to the subpoena on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of the person may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture under the laws of the State, but such person shall not be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which the person may testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, in such proceedings.  Such person so testifying shall not be exempt, however, from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.<P>

Any person who wilfully and unlawfully fails or neglects to appear or to testify or to produce books, papers, and records as required, shall, upon application to a circuit judge, be ordered to appear before the board, there to testify or produce evidence if so ordered, and failure to obey the order may be punished as a contempt of court.<P>

Each witness who appears before the board by subpoena shall receive for the witness' attendance the fees and mileage provided for witnesses in civil cases in courts of record, which shall be audited and paid by the State in the same manner as other expenses are audited and paid, upon the presentation of properly verified vouchers approved by the board.<P>

(c)  A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings had before the board and all testimony and proceedings shall be taken down by a reporter engaged for such purpose or by use of a mechanical recording device.  It shall not be necessary to transcribe the record unless requested for purposes of rehearing or court review.  In the proceedings the board shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence.  No hearsay evidence, however, shall be admitted or considered.<P>

(d) After the final hearing, the board shall promptly make and file an order or decision, incorporating findings of fact upon all the issues involved in the controversy and the determination of the rights of the parties.  Pending the final determination of the controversy the board may, after hearing, make interlocutory orders which may be enforced in the same manner as final orders.  Final orders may dismiss the complaint or require the person complained of to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found to have been committed, suspend the person's rights, immunities, privileges, or remedies granted or afforded by this chapter for not more than one year, and require the person to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without pay, as the board may deem proper.  Any order may further require the person to make reports from time to time showing the extent to which the person has complied with the order.<P>

(e) If any person fails or neglects to obey an order of the board while the same is in effect the board may petition the circuit judge of the judicial circuit wherein the person resides or usually transacts business for the enforcement of the order and for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order, and shall certify and file in the court the record in the proceedings, including all documents and papers on file in the matter, the pleadings and testimony upon which the order was entered, and the decision and order of the board.  Upon such filing the board shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the person by mailing a copy to the person's last known post office address, and thereupon the judge shall have jurisdiction in the premises.<P>

(f) Any person aggrieved by the decision or order of the board may obtain a review thereof as provided in chapter 91 by instituting proceedings in the circuit court of the judicial circuit in which the person or any party resides or transacts business, subject, however, to the general provisions of law for a change of the place of trial or the calling in of another judge.  Where different parties in the same proceeding file petitions for review in two or more courts having proper jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of the judge first petitioned shall be exclusive and the other petitions shall be transferred to the judge.  The petition shall state the grounds upon which a review is sought and copies thereof shall be served upon the other parties and the board.

<strong>NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT</strong><br>

History has shown that organization has been an effective way for working people to change their social environment and to protect their interests. The story of workers' efforts to form labor organizations is long and filled with struggles. From a legal point of view, labor organizations have moved from being outlawed as criminal conspiracy in the nineteenth century to being highly regulated by law today.<P>


<UL><A NAME ="Q1"><li><strong>What Are the Basic Rights of Employees?</strong><br>

Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act clearly states the rights of American workers:<BR>
	Employees shall have the right to self-organization; to form, join, or assist labor organizations; to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing; and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection....<BR>
	Section 7 also protects workers' rights to join labor unions which will best represent their interests and/or to take other collective action to defend their rights in the workplace. Taft-Hartley amended this section by adding that employees "shall also have the right to refrain from any or all such activities."<BR>
	The act officially recognizes that under modern economic conditions "an individual unorganized worker is commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty," so that a worker must be free to organize collectively. As a declared national policy, the NLRA encourages collective bargaining, defines the rights of employees and employers in this process, and seeks "to eliminate certain practices on the part of labor and management that are harmful to the general welfare."<P>

<A NAME ="Q2"><li><strong>Can Employers Oppose Union Activities?</strong><br>

The National Labor Relations Act places legal restrictions on the kinds of actions employers can take. Violations of this law are called unfair labor practices. In general, an employer unfair labor practice is any act which interferes with, restrains, or coerces employees in the exercise of their rights to organize which are guaranteed in Section 7 of the act. It is an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate or retaliate in any way against a worker for exercising his or her rights as a union member, or for taking lawful collective action around workplace issues. This applies to workers in both organized and unorganized workplaces, and covers all aspects of employment, such as hiring, firing, job assignment, promotions, benefits, and discipline.<BR>
	Some examples of employer unfair labor practices are threatening to close down a plant or subcontract work if a union is organized, questioning employees about union activities in an effort to intimidate them, harassing union activists, refusing to reinstate employees to open jobs because they took part in a lawful strike, or demoting a worker for testifying in support of a co-worker's grievance or complaint to the National Labor Relations Board.<P>

<A NAME ="Q3"><li><strong>If There Is No Labor Organization, Can One Be Started?</strong><br>

Yes, workers in any place of employment are free to join an existing organization or start their own. Workers could join an international union, an area association, or start an organization in just one work site.<BR>
	It is an unfair labor practice for an employer to control or favor a particular labor organization. "Company unions" are definitely against federal law. Labor organizations must be free, independent, and worker controlled.<P>

<A NAME ="Q4"><li><strong>Is "Talking Union" Protected?</strong><br>

The right to form a labor organization is protected by the National Labor Relations Act. This means it is illegal for any employer to ban discussion about unions or to retaliate against a worker for trying to organize. Generally, a worker has the right to talk about organizing, and to pass out union membership cards, anywhere in the workplace as long as it does not disrupt production. Handing out leaflets is legally protected as long as it is done on a worker's own time and in non-work areas like the cafeteria, locker rooms, or parking lot.<br>
	If a union election is to be held, employers may be required to provide the union with the names and addresses of workers who may be eligible to form the union. In addition, professional organizers may have the right to enter the workplace if it is open to other members of the public.<br>
	It is illegal for an employer to threaten or intimidate employees or try to bribe them with pay raises or other special benefits in order to discourage unionization. It is often difficult to prove all but the most flagrant abuses, and many management consultants are using subtle psychological techniques to defeat the purposes of the act.<P>

<A NAME ="Q5"><li><strong>How Is the Labor Organization Formed?</strong><br>

The National Labor Relations Act sets up a straightforward procedure for organizing. The first step is to demonstrate that a labor organization has support. This is usually done by "authorization cards" which are signed by workers who want to join the union. Usually, authorization cards are presented to the National Labor Relations Board as evidence of the workers' desire to join a labor organization.<br>
	If the employer sees that many of the employees have indicated a desire to join the union, the employer may voluntarily agree to bargain collectively with the organization and the process is complete.<br>
	Employers often do not voluntarily accept the signed cards as proof of union interest. There are many legal tactics available to employers to delay recognition of the union. When an employer refuses to voluntarily recognize the labor organization, the labor organization, any employee, or the employer may file a "representation petition" requesting an election with the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board.<br>
	The board determines if there is sufficient interest (30 percent of the work force having signed authorization cards) among the workers forming a union. If so, the board will determine the potential bargaining unit and set the date for an election. Determining who should be in the bargaining unit is often a complicated and time-consuming process, with both the employer and the labor organization trying to increase their strengths. The basic test is that all unit members have a "community of interest" in terms of job responsibilities, wage rates, benefits, and other common aspects of work.<P>

<A NAME ="Q6"><li><strong>How Is an Election Held?</strong><br>

The National Labor Relations Board works to ensure a fair election. There are many rules surrounding an election and if an employer or union violates these rules, it is grounds for objections to the validity of the election or an unfair labor practice charge. "If the board determines that objectionable conduct has been committed, it will order a rerun election. If a union has obtained proper authorization cards from a majority of employees in the bargaining unit and the employer subsequently commits serious unfair labor practices precluding a fair election, the board may require the employer to recognize the union without holding an election."<br>
	The election is held by secret ballot and gives workers a choice between one or more unions and no union. If no choice receives a majority of the votes, a runoff election may be held.<P>

<A NAME ="Q7"><li><strong>What Happens after the Election?</strong><br>

If over 50 percent of the employees voting choose to join a particular union, the organization is "certified" and the employer is required to bargain with the organization.<P>

<A NAME ="Q8"><li><strong>If the Union Loses, Can There Be Another Election?</strong><br>

Yes, another election can take place a minimum of twelve months after the first election. In cases where the National Labor Relations Board finds that the employer engaged in objectionable conduct, a rerun election will be ordered without the waiting period.<P>

GROUNDS for Objection to Election:<br>
After an election has been held, the losing party has 7 days to file objections if it believes the election should be overturned.  The NLRB may set aside the results of an election for the following reasons:
<UL>
<li>Threats or reprisals.<br>
<li>Reproduction of NLRB Documents in such a way as to suggest that the Board endorses a particular choice.<BR>
<li>Misrepresentations of NLRB action.<BR>
<li>Employee questioning, polling or surveillance.<BR>
<li>Visiting of voters residences by the employer.<BR>
<li>"Captive Audience" speeches on the eve of election.<BR>
<li>Benefits and Inducements: Promises of benefits (e.g. wage increases if the union loses)<BR>
<li>Appeals to racial prejudice.<BR>
<li>Electioneering near the polls.<BR>
<li>Mis-representation in pre-election statements.</UL><P>


<A NAME ="Q9"><li><strong>If the Union Wins, Can There Be Another Election?</strong><br>

Yes. After twelve months from the first election, another election can be held. Any worker or employee group can request it.<br>
	The methods for initiating and conducting an election to change the bargaining agent (union), or to return to "no representation," are the same as the original election. If the employees vote against the labor organization, it is "decertified," i.e., eliminated. However, if the union and employer have negotiated a contract within twelve months from when the union was certified, then no election can be held until after the expiration of that contract, or three years, whichever comes first. It is illegal for an employer to sponsor any action encouraging a union's decertification.<P>

<A NAME ="Q10"><li><strong>Does the Employer Have to Bargain with the Union?</strong><br>

An employer is required to bargain in "good faith" with the certified labor organization representing the employees. Collective bargaining can be divided into three separate areas: the duty to meet and confer; the duty to bargain in good faith; and the duty to cover certain subjects. The employer is not required to agree to any particular contract provision, no matter how reasonable or fair it appears to the union. However, refusing to meet at reasonable times; refusing to discuss grievances; refusing to discuss wages, benefits, or other mandatory subjects of bargaining; "take it or leave it" bargaining; or attempts to make deals behind the backs of the negotiating committee would be unfair labor practices.<P>

<A NAME ="Q11"><li><strong>Does the Employer Have to Give Information?</strong><br>

The National Labor Relations Act requires that an employer, upon request, supply the union with relevant information needed for bargaining. This means, for example, that the union can obtain the cost of wage and benefit packages from the employer during contract negotiations. A particularly significant rule is that a company claiming financial inability to meet a union's demands may be required to prove its claim by showing its financial records to the union.<br>
	In addition, the duties of the employer extend beyond the period of contract negotiations and can be an effective tool for resolving problems which arise during the life of the contract. For example, a union may be entitled to personnel records or other relevant information it needs to represent its member in grievance proceedings. The National Labor Relations Board has also held that an employer planning to subcontract work or close a plant may be required to give the union the financial data on which it is basing its decision, and an opportunity to bargain over the decision. In some cases, the National Labor Relations Board has required an employer to provide the union with statistics on employment of women and minorities, which can be used to fight discrimination.<P>

<A NAME ="Q12"><li><strong>What Is a Labor Contract?</strong><br>

A labor contract is a private agreement entered into by an employer and a labor organization for the purpose of regulating certain work-related issues. The provisions of the labor contract are binding on both sides for a mutually acceptable period of time and are enforceable through procedures such as the grievance procedure, arbitration, the National Labor Relations Board, or finally, state or federal courts.<br>
	This agreement takes the form of a legal contract for several reasons. Employees need to know in advance about wages, fringe benefits, discipline proceedings, and other matters. Employers need to know the same things, plus want protection from strikes for a certain period of time.<br>
	In the vast majority of cases both parties to the agreement comply with its contents and the law never enters the picture. In some cases serious abuses do occur, and workers may turn to the National Labor Relations Board or the courts to seek protection.<P>

<A NAME ="Q13"><li><strong>What Are Mandatory Subjects of Bargaining?</strong><br>

Both the employer and the employee representative are required to bargain over "wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment." This has been defined over the years to include wages and fringe benefits, grievance procedures, arbitration, health and safety, nondiscrimination clauses, no-strike clauses, length of contract, management rights, discipline, seniority, and union security.<P>

<strong>Wages, Hours, and Fringe Benefits</strong><br>
These provisions are the most important to the average employee. The wages and hours clauses are subject to legal limitations, such as laws concerning minimum wage (state and federal) and consecutive hours (overtime, ICC regulations, and other pertinent laws).<br>
	Possible fringe benefits are limited only by the imagination of the workers. Usual fringes are vacations, holidays, pensions, and health insurance. Others are sick pay, severance pay, reporting pay, day-care facilities, financial services, educational loans, and sabbaticals. All of these subjects are proper topics of the give and take of negotiations.<P>

<strong>Health and Safety</strong><br>
An increasing number of unions are negotiating health and safety provisions into their contracts. Typical provisions might establish the right of a union health and safety committee to make inspections and examine records, or the right of a worker to refuse unsafe work.<P>

<strong>Non-discrimination clauses</strong><br>
There is also a duty to bargain over elimination of discriminatory employment practices. A good non-discrimination clause can often provide the fastest remedy for a worker who is discriminated against by reason of age, race, sex, religion, disability, or national origin. This type of clause can be used as the basis for a grievance about any of these discrimination issues, including sexual harassment, discriminatory health benefits relating to pregnancy, or lower pay for traditionally "women's jobs." <P>

<strong>Length of Contract</strong><br>
An important item of every contract is how long it will be binding. This is strategically important for both sides and often must be determined in light of the rate of inflation, the financial health of the employer, and other similar considerations.<P>

<strong>Management Rights</strong><br>
Employers traditionally work to retain broad control over the operational activities of their business. Management rights usually include decisions such as corporate structure, production levels, and plant size. What is and what is not a "management right" is negotiable, and may be defined in the contract.<p>

<strong>Discipline</strong><br>
Contracts usually include a clause reserving the right of the employer to discipline workers by firing, suspension, notation on work records, and other forms of reprimand. Labor organizations traditionally try to limit this clause by requiring that "just cause" be shown for the discipline. Unions also work for procedural safeguards such as notice, hearings, and review in an attempt to protect the employee. These safeguards are often written in conjunction with the grievance procedure. The goal of the discipline clause is to insure that all facts are heard and that the punishment is not arbitrary or unfair.<P>

<strong>Seniority</strong><br>
The seniority clause is a method by which senior employees protect their jobs in work areas involving transfers, promotions, bumping, filling vacancies, and layoffs. Seniority rights can be established on a department or plant-wide basis and may be conditioned on the worker's ability to perform on the job. These clauses are often the most complicated in a contract and vary with the kind of work.<P>

<strong>Dues Collection</strong><br>
Union and management may negotiate a mutually agreeable means of union dues collection. The most convenient method is the "check-off" system by which the company automatically deducts the amount from the employee's paycheck. Such a practice is negotiable.<P>

<strong>Union Security</strong><br>
A labor organization often seeks to protect its strength by insisting on a union security clause. Long ago, the closed-shop agreement by which an employer could only hire members of a particular union was declared illegal. In Hawai'i, management and labor can negotiate a contract which requires that when a worker is hired into a job covered by the contract, he or she must join the union within a short period of time. This is called a union shop. It should be noted that this is an area where the National Labor Relations Act allows state control. A state may enact a so-called "right to work" law and declare union security clauses illegal. Hawai'i is one of 29 states that has no such law.<br>
	A contract may also provide for a weaker form of union security. Under an agency shop, for example, no employee is required to join the union. However, any worker who does not join must pay a "service fee" or "fair share" to cover the expense the union incurs by representing all members of the bargaining unit, as it is legally required to do.<br>
	These clauses vary greatly from contract to contract and industry to industry. Often they do not exist at all.<P>

<strong>Grievance Procedure</strong><br>
Because contracts cannot foresee every problem that will arise at work, most collective bargaining agreements include the establishment of a mutually agreeable procedure to settle differences in contract interpretation. Furthermore, the grievance procedure is usually the means a worker has of enforcing the contract.<P>

<strong>Arbitration</strong><br>
If the parties cannot agree on contract interpretation or proper enforcement, they may wish to call in an impartial outsider, or "arbitrator," to settle the question. This is only possible when an "arbitration clause" is negotiated into the contract. An arbitration clause provides an alternative to time-consuming lawsuits.<br>
	This category of contract language will often define how the arbitrator will be selected, who will pay what share, and what the arbitrator's scope of authority will be. Often, both sides will agree that the arbitrator's decision is final or "binding." This means the courts cannot review the arbitrator's decision unless it is clearly contrary to law.<P>

<strong>No-Strike Clause</strong><br>
Most employers insist that the labor organization agree not to strike for the duration of a contract. Such an agreement is enforceable in court and enables the employer to plan production without fear of work stoppages. This makes "wildcat strikes" illegal and may even require that the union discipline the strikers.<br>
	No-strike clauses have been interpreted to ban almost all strikes during the life of the contract, except strikes in response to abnormally dangerous working conditions (see the chapter on occupational safety and health). Strikes are still legal, of course, when the contract expires.<P>

<A NAME ="Q14"><li><strong>What Kinds of Acts Are Unfair Labor Practices?</strong><br>

Employers may be charged with Unfair Labor Practices if they attempt to deprive their workers of the right to form, join or assist a labor union; the right to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing; or the right to engage in "concerted activity" for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.  Specifically, section 8(a) of the National labor Relations Act makes it unfair for the employer to prevent workers from exercising the above rights by:<br>
<UL>
<li>interfering, restraining or coercing their workers;<BR>
<li>dominating or seeking to control the union;<BR>
<li>discriminating against workers for union activity;<BR>
<li>discharging a worker who files a ULP or testifies to a ULP;<BR>
<li>refuses to bargain in good faith with a duly elected union.
</UL><p>

Since the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, labor organizations have been restricted in ways similar to employers. This amendment to the National Labor Relations Act makes it illegal for a union to:<br>
<UL><li>coerce people to become union members;<br>
<li>use threats, intimidation, or violence;<br>
<li>force an employer to punish a worker because he/she doesn't get along with the union;<br>
<li>charge excessive union dues;<br>
<li>refuse to bargain in good faith with the employer.</UL><br>
	In addition, a union cannot force a worker to use the union grievance procedure, although it may have a representative present at the grievance meeting. Any worker who wants to try to settle a problem directly with the employer may do so unless specifically prohibited by the bargaining agreement.<P>

<A NAME ="Q15"><li><strong>Can a Union Punish Employees Who Disagree with Union Policy?</strong><br>

Unions commit an unfair labor practice if they "restrain or coerce" any organization rights of employees. For example, if an employee seeks to decertify a bargaining unit (i.e., kick out the union by a new election), there is nothing the union can legally do to get the worker fired or to harm his or her job status.<br>
	A labor organization does have broad power to make and enforce its own rules, and such rules can provide for fines or expulsion from membership for anti-union activity. However, these sanctions are totally internal affairs. A union cannot legally have a person fired for breaking union rules or refusing to pay union fines.<br>
	Where union membership is a condition of employment ("union shop"), expulsion from the union does not lead to expulsion from the job except for failure to pay dues. As long as an employee continues to pay dues, discharging the employee for violating union rules would be an unfair labor practice by the union and the employer.<P>

<A NAME ="Q16"><li><strong>What Is the Union's Responsibility to the Members of the Bargaining Unit?</strong><br>

The union must represent all the workers in the bargaining unit fairly and equally, whether or not they belong to the union. This is known as the duty of fair representation, and a union which violates this duty may be subject to an unfair labor practice charge or lawsuit by an aggrieved member.<br>
	A union can meet its responsibilities under the duty of fair representation by representing everyone in the bargaining unit equally, handling similar cases consistently, investigating each grievance and problem thoroughly, keeping written records, observing time limits, and maintaining an internal process of appeal.<P>

<A NAME ="Q17"><li><strong>What If the Union Violates the Duty of Fair Representation?</strong><br>

An employee who has been treated unfairly by his/her union can file an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board or sue the union and/or employer in state or federal court. Before the board or courts will hear such a claim, the employee must do all he/she can through the contract's and union's procedures. If the board or courts uphold an employee's charge of unfair treatment by the union, lost pay, reinstatement, or other compensation can be awarded.<p>

<A NAME ="Q18"><li><strong>What If an Unfair Labor Practice Has Taken Place?</strong><br>

Any employer, employee, or group of employees may file an unfair labor practice charge with the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board.<BR>
	If anyone believes a violation has occurred, he/she should write to:<P>

		<blockquote>Officer-in-Charge<br>
		National Labor Relations Board<br>
		Prince Kuhio Federal Building, Room 7318<br>
		300 Ala Moana Boulevard<BR>
		Honolulu, HI   96850<BR>
		(808) 541-2814</blockquote><P>

	This office will send the appropriate forms and information to file a formal charge. The formal charge must be filed and served on the charged party within six months of the violation and contain a brief general description of what happened. Under the NLRB rules, the charging party has the responsibility for insuring that the charge is timely served on the charged party. Any employee, whether in a union or not, may file. No lawyer is required and there is no filing fee or other cost to the employee.<P>

<A NAME ="Q19"><li><strong>What Will Happen After the Charge is Made?</strong><br>

An NLRB investigator will look into the charge. This will involve determining jurisdiction, researching the facts of the case, and interviewing workers, union representatives, the employer, and other witnesses. The employer or labor organization is guilty of an unfair labor practice if it interferes with the investigation.<br>
	The investigator will then make a full report to the NLRB's regional office where it will be studied. If the regional office finds there was no violation, it will ask for the charge to be withdrawn. If not withdrawn, it can dismiss the charge and this decision is appealable to the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C.<br>
	If the regional office feels a violation did take place, it will issue a complaint to the charged party. The charged party can demand a hearing, which is much like a trial. The board will provide attorneys at such a hearing who will argue in favor of the complaint. The decision of the hearing can also be appealed.<br>
	Of course, the problem may be solved informally at any point along the way.<P>

<A NAME ="Q20"><li><strong>What If an Unfair Labor Practice Has Been Determined?</strong><br>

If the National Labor Relations Board finds that an unfair labor practice has been committed by either an employer or a labor organization, it has the power to order the practice stopped and to compensate the victim.<br>
	Common remedies ordered by the board include reinstatement to a job with or without back pay, ordering new elections, or requiring employers to post notices concerning the rights of their employees. Each party has the right to appeal any of these orders, and it often takes years before a case is resolved.<P>

<A NAME ="Q21"><li><strong>What Other Laws Protect the Rights of Union Members within Their Unions?</strong><br>

The <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/ch11.html">Landrum-Griffin Act</A> (officially called the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959) is the basic federal law protecting individual rights of union members. It contains a "bill of rights" for union members and sets up procedures for union elections, discipline, and financial reporting.<P>

<A NAME ="Q22"><li><strong>Who Is Covered by the Landrum-Griffin Act?</strong><br>

The <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/ch11.html">Landrum-Griffin Act</A> applies to all members of unions in the private sector and to those federal, state, or local government employees who belong to unions representing both public and private employees.<P>

<A NAME ="Q23"><li><strong>Must a Union Be Run as a Democracy?</strong><br>

Yes. The <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/ch11.html">Landrum-Griffin Act</A> insures all union members a voice in the affairs of the union. Employees have complete freedom to "express any view, arguments, or opinions" at union meetings or functions without punishment. This includes the right to hand out leaflets to other union members or to seek publicity, as long as the union member doesn't advocate supporting a rival union or breaking the contract with the employer.<br>
	Freedom of assembly is also protected. Union members may meet outside of regular union meetings and discuss union affairs without fear of reprisals from union officials.<p></UL>

I cannot hear the music any more.<br>
The river's song spilled out beneath<br>
My hungry art, fills up the waters<br>
In wide, flat arena with her echoes.<P>
Plumbing the depth of this basin;<br>
warming dreams of the lodge and my lost<br>
spring, I push the pond further down stream<br>
altering last year's alteration alone<P>
The beaver's curse to bite off more than<br>
he can chew makes the cut less than<br>
kind but more bark than castor-<br>
ation.<P>
II<P>
The tastes of aspen and birch empty<br>
of their savor now tease my tongue with<br>
scented memories, submerged music<br>
inaudible to land ears, unheard of airs.<p>
that imbue every hair every morsel<br>
of my chiseled island manger every<br>
cutting and stump in the beaver realm<br>
with the craft of her musky play.<P>
In the pond I listen for the soft roll<br>
of her heart to beat on me again<br>
but the water is heavy with what she is not<br>
and a heart cannot sound alone.<P>
III<P>
In search of the soft wood again, hungry<br>
and cold in the creek, here is Ahmik<br>
to incise the bust of my belov'd<br>
from pole to pole across the wide canal<P>
There is art, poor beast, in the simplest<br>
breast that carries pain against the flow.<br>
There is in sculpted wood still refief<br>
to take a measure in a lover's cameo<P>
The echo sings alone: <em>Kennst du das Land?</em><br>
Alluvial haunt of the river rat. Sand,<br>
rich with the chips and crumbs of time,<br>
home to happy, thoughtless protozoa.<P>
IV<P>
Little wonder teeming in the stream<br>
Do you know it? The womb of earth<br>
The fetal echo of its younger heart<br>
resounding in the surface tension.<P>
But I cannot hear it for Long<br>
Time.  My sharp ears are cropt;<br>
the music squeezed out of its hole<br>
and the cry of my song crippled.<P>
But my hands are still busy on the keys<br>
now robbed of their rich voices<br>
Yet kept scratching at the night<br>
at what they would say if it could be heard.<P>

CODA<P>
Lay me down on thy soft breast<br>
onanistic night walker.  Sweet<br>
Nothing on a curtain of pain en-<br>
Gendered by a brief elision.<P>
Thou, who took the beaver, skinned him<br>
Inside out, and cured his worthless hide<P>

<strong>CHANGING LABOR`S IMAGE: UNIONS, THE MEDIA AND PUBLIC OPINION</strong>  (1986, 22 min, V-05)<br>
Strikes, violence, corruption and greed dominating the portrayal of unions in the news media has made organizing harder in the 80s and 90s. This program examines the extent and nature of labor`s public image problem; looks at how the media presents labors` issues and contributes to the problem; and concludes by highlighting the way unions and union members are trying to change labor`s public image. Produced by Pennsylvania State University and Professor Paul F. Clark.<p>

<strong>GETTING ON TV AND RADIO</strong> (1985, 28 min, V-15)<br>
A step-by-step guide for local unions that want to get their message on TV and radio, local newscasts, TV talk shows, editorial replies, public service announcements and paid advertising.

<strong>MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD</strong> (1991, 12 min, V-38)<br>
Produced by the International Labor Communications Association (ILCA) and designed to be used at  union meetings, conventions/conferences and union educational programs. The commercial media often covers labor by emphasizing the negative and ignoring the many contributions labor unions make to society. Even union members get most of their information about labor through uninformed and often biased commercial sources. A strong and effective labor press is crucial to getting labor`s message out to union members. The labor press offers an alternative viewpoint--the  voice of workers themselves. This video, featuring television celebrity and union advocate Howard Hesseman, effectively conveys the point that communicating with union members doesn`t require a million-dollar budget or a journalism degree. It takes a humorous and creative look at the future as well as examining real-life people and situations to convey a serious message.<P>

<strong>VIDEO AS AN ORGANIZING TOOL</strong>  (1985, 36 min, V-58)<BR>

<strong>EVERY MEMBER AN ORGANIZER</strong> (1996, 9 minutes)<br>
An up-beat Teamsters Union production featuring President Ron Carey that shows the success possible when the union uses its own members as volunteers to organize "worker to worker"  while their professional organizers work more as campaign coordinators.

<strong>MARTY LEVITT:  A DIRTY BUSINESS</strong>  (1990, 110 min, V-35)<BR>
A series of four half-hour programs featuring former union buster and author Marty Levitt who describes how he got into and out of union busting.

The four programs are:  1) Biography,  2) Training the Troops, 3) Tactics, and 4) Busting the Buster. Produced by the University of Minnesota, Labor Education Service.<P>

Higgins makes it clear that the Church regards labor unions as "indispensable" to adequately defend human rights in the workplace so that especially women and immigrant workers may secure a living wage and decent working conditions.<P>


<strong>UNION ORGANIZER: BEST JOB IN AMERICA </strong> (1990, 8:30 min, V-52)<BR>

Forrest Sawyer anchors this alarming study about the hazards workers encounter at the workplace. In 1989 it was estimated 60,000 people die each year from dangers on the job that could have been prevented, and 2 million workers were injured because of poor safety precautions. This documentary questions the efficacy of OSHA as it examines all aspects of the workforce, from blue-collar workers to office  workers to farmers. Originally aired on April 20, 1989, coincidentally the week before the first Worker Memorial Day was proclaimed by the AFL-CIO. A copy of the transcript of this ABC News Special is also available on request.<P>

<strong>THE CASE OF THE GRIEVING WAITRESS</strong> (1987, 15 min, V-04)<br>
Produced by the Center for Labor Research and Education at UC Berkeley, this tape is specially designed for use in union shop steward training. This video shows the steward in an actual grievance situation. A foodserver has been suspended for five days for refusing to work an extra shift assigned without notice. The steward`s handling of the step-one meeting is shown. In the end a compromise remedy is reached. The video, therefore, provides the basis for class discussion and analysis of the steward`s handling of the step-one hearing and of the merits of the remedy she accepted. The program comes with an instructor`s guide.<P>

<strong>DO`S AND DONT`S OF GRIEVANCE HANDLING</strong> (1994, 18 min)<br>

It describes the origins of the duty; goes through a Grievance Checklist; and answers common steward questions regarding the liability the duty places on unions and union stewards.<P>


<strong>GRIEVANCE HANDLING</strong>  (1983, 59 min, V-18)<br>
Produced by the U.S. Department of Labor. In the first portion of this excellent presentation, the narrator describes the basic responsibilities of union representatives in grievance processing as well as the basic four steps of most grievance procedures. An incident involving a recently elected steward is used to show how to process a grievance from the initial employee complaint through the second step of a typical, negotiated grievance procedure. The second portion of the film presents both appropriate and inappropriate approaches to grievance handling as the second step hearing between the steward and the supervisor is dramatized. The on-camera narrator links and explains the unfolding events  for orientation and training purposes from the union point of view. [Also available in 16mm film]<P>

<strong>SCENES FROM THE WORKPLACE </strong> (1975, 22 min, V-47)<BR>
Work situations which commonly trigger the filing of grievances are depicted in eight vignettes, each 1-1/2 minutes long. The video provides an excellent setting for a discussion on factors which strengthen or weaken the position of the employer and the grievant. [also available in 16mm film]<P>

<strong>TURN IT AROUND: TEAMSTER STEWARDS SOLVING PROBLEMS ON THE JOB</strong> (1994, 17min.)<br>
A grievance handling training video with four discussion breaks worked into the vignette to allow participants to consider the pros and cons of different problem-solving strategies. Using a distribution center as a sample work site, the steward uses a group-grievance over unfair assignment of the checker job to organize the workers and put an end to much-resented favoritism.<P>

<strong>GRASS ROOTS LOBBYING</strong> (1985, 8:25 min, V-17)<br>
Produced by the Kamber Group for the Building and Construction Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, this program is designed to show union members the importance of their involvement in grass roots lobbying. From card and letter writing to phone calls and personal appointments, the actual contact of union members is an important supplement to the union`s national lobbying efforts.

<strong>IT'S YOUR CHOICE</strong> (1996, 8 min.)<br>
A video produced by the Teamsters Union to encourage members who are cynical about politicians to get involved in political action.

<strong>KILLING US SOFTLY - Rice & Roses</strong> (1980, 30 min , V-29)<br>
The premise of this interestingly presented and provocative video is that the depiction of women in magazine advertising is sexist and demeaning to women and contributes and reinforces their lower status in our culture. The lecturer uses dozens of slides of magazine ads to illustrate the various points she is making; such as her contention that many ads clearly depict women as sex objects; that other ads tell women that unless they use certain products they cannot be perfect while implying that anything less than perfection is unacceptable; that the fact that women are usually depicted in low status roles or as subordinate to men contributes to their low self-esteem.<P>

<strong>GLOBAL ASSEMBLY LINE </strong> (1986, 58 min, V-57)<BR>
New technology and methods of communication have facilitated the movement of jobs out of the U.S. as multinational corporations search for ever lower labor costs. What conditions are like for women workers in the less developed countries is revealed in this documentary which concentrates on garment and electronics industries that have moved to the Phillipines and Mexico. In brutally frank interviews, corporate officers tell us exactly why they have moved production to these areas--increased profits, no protective legislation or union. When the exploited young women who face illness and exhaustion before they are 30 try to organize, the corporations threaten to move to still lower wage areas. This documentary presents the  background for a discussion of multinationals, plant closings, foreign trade and related issues.<P>


<strong>THE JAPAN THEY DON`T TELL YOU ABOUT</strong>  (1986, 40 min, V-26)<br>
An NBC White Paper originally broadcast April 22, 1986 that debunks the myth of Japanese efficiency and industrial superiority.

Moving from the unconventional management style at the very successful, high-tech product development firm IDEO in Palo Alto to German and Japanese industrial employers in South Carolina and Georgia show the new and inescapable focus on self-management teams and address the question of what will happen to the majority of America's workers who don't benefit from the new  productivity increases and sometimes get trapped into the growing pool of contingent workers who have little or no hope of advancing to more secure or better paid jobs.

Developing countries are offering deals, including tax breaks and low-paid labor, that bottom-liners cannot resist.  The program looks at union members in Illinois who were defeated in long strikes that ended with the companies making more money with fewer employees.  A former insurance salesman with six children is worried that he may have to sell his cars or even his house. A woman tells of taking a 70 percent cut from $45,000 a year to $6.50 an hour.  Another woman, who was happy to make $6.50 an hour in a Van Heusen shirt plant before it ended operations last year, is now trying to make do on $4.25 an hour. The mayor of what used to be a prosperous company town says: "The whole country is going down the tube to Guatemala."  On the other side of the coin, Al Dunlap, who laid off 11,000 workers in the course of turning Scott Paper around, defends his multimillion-dollar income by asserting that he earned billions for stockholders and adds, "It's no crime to be successful." And T.J. Rodgers, who is switching thousands of jobs in his semiconductor company to the Philippines, says he learned while losing $20 million trying to keep operating in the United States that "you can't save a job that doesn't have a right to exist."<p>

</center>How fairly are unions portrayed by the media?  Leaders of the labor movement have long contended that they are subjected to a negative bias.  Yet in recent years, the media have been widely judged to be "liberal" in their treatment of political and social issues.<P>

With a broad sweep and an accessible style, William Puette analyzes the portrayal of organized labor in movies, on television, and in newspapers, including cartoons.  He considers in detail the national media's representation of the Pittston coal miners' strike and follows the accumulation of distortions in local coverage of a labor dispute in Hawai'i.  He then suggests a theoretical framework for understanding typical media treatment of organized labor.<P>

At a time when the media exert unprecedented influence on public attitudes and most Americans have no personal connections with organized labor, identifying systematic distortions is a necessary first step toward more balanced and accurate representation.<P>

<center><h3>Two New CLEAR Services Available</H3></center>
<strong>Facilitation and Strategic Planning Retreats</strong><br>
CLEAR is now able to provide facilitation services for union meetings or meetings between the union and management where a neutral outside party is needed. There are times when it is difficult for union leaders to both conduct a meeting and fully participate in discussing the issue, especially when they are also one of the stakeholders. Using an outside facilitator enables leaders to fully participate. For the same reason it may also be useful in some situations to use an outside facilitator for certain meetings between the union and management.<P>
If it is time for your union to do some serious long-range planning, assess your current objectives and define or refine your future goals, a strategic planning retreat may be the answer. Strategic planning is a proactive step designed to objectively assess and enhance the unions effectiveness as well as prepare for and hopefully sidestep crisis situations.<P>
For more information about either of these programs contact Adrienne Valdez at CLEAR, phone 956-7145 or <A HREF = "mailto:valdez@Serv1.arthum.Hawaii.edu"><IMG SRC="Images/CLEARmailButton.GIF"> valdez@Serv1.arthum.Hawaii.edu </A>

<hr size=6><FONT SIZE=3>
September of 1996 marked the 50th year since the Great Hawai'i Sugar Strike that in large degree and forever changed the islands economically, politically, and socially.  About twenty six thousand sugar workers and their families, 76 thousand people in all, began a 79-day strike on September 1, 1946 that completely shut down 33 of Hawai'i's 34 plantations. The 1946 sugar strike brought an end to Hawai'i's paternalistic labor relations ushering in a new era of participatory democracy both on the plantations and throughout Hawai'i's political  and social institutions.
<P>
This special hour-long <strong>Rice & Roses</strong> documentary includes interviews with surviving strikers and their relatives and friends from all the islands who organized the food-kitchens and support committees and an array of never-before-seen photos and artifacts from a two-year research project conducted by the Center for Labor Education and Research.<P>

<FONT SIZE=5><strong>Why Rice & Roses?</FONT></strong><br>


On Tuesday, December 15th, 1970 a special advisory committee representing a
cross-section of Hawai`i's unions first met to develop plans for the opening
programs of a new weekly public television series designed for the working
people of the islands.  It was decided at that meeting that the title of
series would be <STRONG><VAR> Rice & Roses</VAR></STRONG>, from an idea that occurred to David Thompson of
the ILWU when he read the famous, old IWW poem "Bread & Roses."  The poet
James Oppenheim had taken his title from a banner he had seen carried by
young mill girls in the 1912 Lawrence textile strike in Massachusetts.
<P>
The mill girls banner said, "We want bread and roses too."   Oppenheim's poem
was later set to music and the poem has since become almost a labor union
anthem of the East Coast garment workers.  It emphasizes the call of the
working men and women for more than just survival wages, more than just bread
alone.  As the poem asserts "Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until
life closes; Hearts starve as well as bodies; give us bread, but give us
roses!"
<P>
The image of "roses"  symbolizes all the things that can nourish the mind and
soul of the worker. And, though in the poem "bread" symbolizes the basic
necessities that nourish and sustain the body,  for Hawai`i's workers it was
decided that "rice" instead of "bread" better expressed this metaphor.
<P>
The series first went on the air in 1971 with thirteen programs beginning
Wednesday, February 10, at 6:30pm.  It was from the start a series by and
about Hawai`i's labor movement produced by Hawai`i ETV in cooperation with the
University of Hawai`i's College of Continuing Education and Community Service.
Guy Nunn, director of the Center for Labor-Management Education was the host
of the first series which employed a magazine style format.
<P>
The second series was produced/directed by Monte Hickock by agreement with
the Labor Advisory Council (LAC).  Air-time: alternate Mondays at 6:30pm,
repeated the following Sunday at 5pm.  An old KHET press release describes
the series starting on February 26, 1973, but the actual program descriptions
in our files don't start until April 2nd.
<P>
A third series was produced by Bob Miller and funded by a specific
legislative grant to Hawai`i Public Television.  Air-time: Wednesday nights at
8:30, repeated on Sundays at 5:30pm.  Between 1978 and 1981, KHET presented a
Rice & Roses bulletin/newsletter produced and hosted by Max Roffman and
directed by Larry Sichter.  Air-times: Mondays at 7pm repeated on Sundays at
5pm. In June of 1980, the Monday air-time was moved to 7:30pm.
<P>
Chris Conybeare began as producer/host in the Fall of 1981, Joy Chong
directing.  Air-time: Mondays at 7:30pm then 7pm, repeated on Sundays at 5pm.
 In 1986, the time-spot shifted to Tuesdays at  7:30pm, repeated Fridays at
1:30pm;  in 1987 the repeat broadcast was moved to Wednesday at 8:30pm.
<P>
Regular programming as a series ceased after 1987.   In 1988 only 2 were
produced; in 1989 just one. No shows were on in 1990 or 1991.  One special
was produced in '92, and three  shows were produced in FY93-94, making a
total production of 309 shows in the 24 years between 1971-1995.

<strong>1946: THE GREAT HAWAII SUGAR STRIKE - Rice & Roses</strong> (1996, 60 min.)<BR>
About twenty six thousand sugar workers and their families, 76 thousand people in all, began a 79-day strike on September 1, 1946 that completely shut down 33 of Hawai'i's 34 plantations. The 1946 sugar strike brought an end to Hawai'i's paternalistic labor relations ushering in a new era of

political  and social institutions. This special hour-long <em>Rice & Roses</em> documentary produced for the 50th anniversary of the strike, includes interviews with surviving strikers and their relatives and friends from all the islands who organized the food-kitchens and support committees and an array of never-before-seen photos and artifacts from a two-year research project conducted by the Center for Labor Education and Research.<P>

From their decrepit housing and inadequate medical benefits to the substandard wages and lack of access to ordinary labor law protections, 800,000 migrants, thirty years after Murrow`s expose, still live in labor camps and suffer working conditions as bad, if not worse, in 1990 than they did in 1960. In 1986, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) organized Campbell`s migrant workers, but union organizers still cannot reach the majority of the workers. Many employers resort instead to illegal aliens to keep their costs down, creating racial tensions between Black Americans, Guatemalans and Haitians. Aired on public television on April17, 1990.<P>

<strong>P.O.V.: THE UPRISING OF `34</strong> (1995, 90 min.)<br>
A fledging textile workers` union attempted unsuccessfully in 1934 to organize garment workers in the South. Originally broadcast by the Public Braodcasting System on June 27, 1995, this documentary looks at one of the greatest social upheavals in the South since the Civil War and decades before the Civil Rights movement was able to take on the great industrial bastions of economic power in the South. <P>


<strong>THE RIVER RAN RED</strong> (1993, 58 min)<br>
Blair Brown narrates this gripping account of the Homestead Lockout.  In the summer of 1892, a bitter conflict erupted at the Carnegie Steel Works in Homestead, Pennsylvania.  The nation`s largest steel maker hired a small army of Pinkerton detective agency armed guards to invade Homestead and subdue the union men and their community supporters with devasting consequences.<P>

<strong>SALT OF THE EARTH </strong> (1954, Independant Prod. - feature film, 94 min, V46)<BR>
A strong pro-labor film with a particularly sympathetic interest in the Mexican-Americans with whom it deals. True, it frankly implies that the mine operators have taken advantage of the Mexican-born or descended laborers, have forced a <em>speed up</em> in their mining techniques and given them less respectable homes than provided the so-called Anglo laborers. It slaps at brutal police tactics in dealing with the strikers and it gets in some rough, sarcastic digs at the attitude of `the bosses` and the working of the Taft-Hartley Law. (from the New York Times review by Bosley Crowther, 3-15-54)<P>



<strong>SIT DOWN AND FIGHT: WALTER REUTHER AND THE RISE OF THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS UNION </strong> (1992, 60min)<BR>  A PBS documentary produced for The American Experience series introduced by David McCullough, narrated by Tresa Hughes, written & produced by Charlotte Mitchell Zwerin.<P>

<strong>STRIKESTORY: San Francisco before the `34 </strong> (1994, 30 min)<br>
A documentary film by Rhian Miller telling a part the story of the West Coast Dock strike of 1934. This film focuses on the Great General Strike in San Francisco that was supported by 100,000 workers and shut down the city for three days, and the murder July 6th on Mission Street of picketing longshoremen.  Featuring interviews with Bill Bailey, Elaine Black Yoneda and many of the survivors of that historic strike that saw the birth of th ILWU.<P>

<hr>
September 1996 marked the 50th year since
the Great Hawai'i Sugar Strike that in large degree forever changed the islands
economically, politically, and socially.  About twenty six thousand sugar workers and their families, 76 thousand people in all, began a 79-day strike on September 1, 1946 that completely shut down
33 of Hawai`i's 34 plantations. The 1946 sugar strike brought an end to Hawai`i's paternalistic labor relations ushering in a new era of
participatory democracy both on the plantations and throughout Hawai`i's
political  and social institutions.
<P>
This special hour-long <strong>Rice & Roses</strong> documentary includes interviews with surviving strikers and their relatives and friends from all the islands who organized the food-kitchens and support committees and an array of never-before-seen photos and artifacts from a two-year research project conducted by the Center for Labor Education and Research.<P>
<HR Size=6 noshade>

CLEAR is still seeking the assistance of any and everyone who was involved in or has photos or memorabilia of any sort from this landmark historical event.  
Oahu residents can call CLEAR at <STRONG>956-7145</STRONG> and leave a message (or <A HREF = "MAILTO:Puette@hawaii.edu">email</A>) for Dr. Puette
or research specialist Teresa Bill.  Neighbor Island residents can call the
local offices of the ILWU [<STRONG>Kaua`i - 245-3374</STRONG>;  <STRONG>Maui - 244-9191</STRONG>; <STRONG>Hawai`i- 935-3727</STRONG>]
<P>
<strong>Why was this Strike so important?</strong><br>Before 1946, Hawai`i's economy, politics
and social structures were completely dominated by a corporate elite known as
the Big Five (Alexander & Baldwin, American Factors, Castle & Cooke, C.
Brewer, & Theo. Davies). The leaders of these factor companies exercised
absolute control over Hawai`i's plantation workers and the majority of the
islands multi-ethnic workforce. The 1946 strike forever changed the balance
of power between workers and the plantations. No longer would living and
working conditions be set unilaterally by the plantation owners or their
parent corporations. Nor was the lesson lost on the workers outside the
plantation either. As sugar workers were now successful in challenging the
plantations, so too would all the other employers often subsidiaries of one
of the Big Five now be brought to the bargaining table to improve their wages
and working conditions.
<P>
The 1946 sugar strike was monumental both in terms of the numbers of people
involved and the issues at stake. Never before had all the sugar workers of
every ethnic group joined together in the same labor organization. Previous
efforts of the workers to organize had been easily smashed because of a lack
of worker solidarity across ethnic lines. Japanese workers belonged to their
own higher wage association just as the Filipino sugar workers had their
own union. Bitter lessons were learned from the unsuccessful 1909 and 1920
Japanese strikes and the 1920, 1924 and 1937 Filipino labor movements which
failed because of ethnic unionism. The great strike of 1946 started with a
new premise of organizing workers of all races into a single labor union.
Never again would workers be divided and conquered because of ethnic
antagonism. This strategy of ethnic solidarity was successful but it was not
easy. A concerted effort to include the concerns and issues of all Hawai`i's
workers, to communicate in every language was necessary for the multi-ethnic
union to succeed.
<P>
The legacy of the great Hawaiian sugar strike of 1946 is the success we can
see today of Hawai`i's multi-ethnic workforce to bridge ethnic differences and
build trust based on worker solidarity. Hawai`i's diverse workforce united in
1946 and began for the first time to form a single working class culture,
unique to Hawai`i.
<P>
Like today, the issues of housing, medical care, pensions and wages were key
issues for the 1946 sugar workers. Previously the quality of housing, medical
care and old-age pensions depended upon the whim of individual plantations.
The 1946 sugar strike negotiated new labor relations establishing these
important issues as contractual rights of workers, rather than as favors the
plantations could wield to force worker compliance. Thus, the 1946 sugar
strike is an event whose impact reaches beyond the sugar fields, into the
lives of every worker in Hawai`i.
<P>
Importantly, the role of the neighbor islands in the 1946 sugar strike was
tremendous. Concentrated, community-based organizing made these communities a
special place in the history of Hawai`is working people. The 1946 strike was
the first island-wide sugar strike, the first industry-wide shut-down in
Hawai`i's history. The strength of the 1946 sugar strike and the community
organizing it built upon was so solid on the neighbor islands, especially
Kaua`i and Hawai`i, that it soon became the bedrock of a new political order.
<P>
The active support and involvement of family and workers throughout Hawai`i,
made this strike a success. Appropriately, the history of the 1946 sugar
strike is the history of community organizing all members of the community
including wives and children. The success of the strike built upon the
support of not just workers, but workers families both relatives who had
left the plantations and children themselves only a few years from working
for the plantations. The story of the 1946 sugar strike includes soup
kitchens, morale committees with talent nights and dances, community garden,
hunting and fishing parties, bumming committees to solicit from stores and
other supporters, baseball teams through which organizers like Major Okada
met and solicited new members.
<P>
The 1946 strike is recent enough that many adults have a recollection of the
events. But our young people and even many adults in their 20s and 30s have
neither memories, nor access to their history in regards to this important
event that changed the way workers and employers in Hawai`i interact not only
sugar workers, but all workers. The legacy of the 1946 sugar strike is larger
than sugar. Its legacy is the formation of a multiethnic community force
working together to address social and political problems. Community
organizing not only won the 1946 sugar strike, it also laid the foundation
for political change including the Democratic Revolution of 1954.
<P>
The 1946 sugar strike is an element of our past firmly embedded in our
present selves. It is a catalyst for many social and political changes that
we have completely incorporated into our sense of community. Dignity for
working people; a living wage for our families; a multi-ethnic community
working together for social change, meeting the challenges of the future
head-on. Labors history is everyones history. Hawai`i has a proud, vigorous
labor history that addresses the lessons our young people must learn
today how do you work with others to improve your community?<P>

<center><H2>Tahitian Trade Unionists to Visit Hawai'i</H2></center>
Nineteen leaders of Tahiti's Labor Movement were arrested in 1995 for their protests of French nuclear testing in the Pacific.

According to Amnesty Internationl's web-site [<A HREF ="http://www.amnesty.se/aixweb96/29de.htm">http://www.amnesty.se/aixweb96/29de.htm </A>]:
<blockquote>
On 9 September 16 trade unionists were detained by members of the <em>gendarmerie nationale</em>. Officers in combat dress burst into the <em>A Tia I Mua</em> union headquarters shortly before a press conference. The authorities claimed that the arrests were in connection with the civil disturbances of 6 September at Faaaa airport. These followed mass protests and violence in Tahiti as a result of the nuclear testing at Mururoa.  The unions Secretary General, Hiro Tefaarere, claimed he was kicked and punched by the officers. Henri Temaititahio of the <em>Office des Postes et Telecommunications</em> was reportedly knocked unconscious with a truncheon. After his release later that day he collapsed and was hospitalized, suffering from a progressive paralysis of the left side of his body. All the detainees were handcuffed behind their backs and stacked face downwards in a military lorry which took them to the gendarmerie barracks. The detainees were then reportedly forced to kneel in the parking area of the barracks, still handcuffed behind their backs and their faces to the ground for approximately 45 minutes.</blockquote>

"A Tia I Mua" is a confederation representing primarily public sector unions in Tahiti, and "The Democratic and Independent Union Confederation of Polynesian Workers" is a private sector union that has organized hotels and supermarkets there.  From January 12 to the 19th, three representatives from these two Tahitian trade union confederations will be visiting O'ahu to meet with Labor union leadership here and discuss their plight.<p>  
Unable to afford financial support for this visit, CLEAR wishes to thank the following local unions for their generous support: HSTA, HGEA-AFSCME Local 152, UFCW Local 480, HERE Local 5,  Laborers Local 368, Carpenters Local 745, and Teamsters Local 996.<p>
A special series of public service TV commercials have been prepared and are now airing in Hawai'i to acquaint the general public with the issues at steak in their protest.  Labor groups that may be interested in meeting with the Tahitian visitors during their brief stay, may contact CLEAR at 956-7145 and leave a message for Dr. Boyd.

1996 marks the 50th year since the Great Hawai'i Sugar Strike that in large degree and forever changed Hawai'i economically, politically, and socially.  About twenty six thousand sugar workers and their families, 76 thousand people in all, began a 79-day strike on September 1, 1946 that completely shut down 33 of Hawai'i's 34 plantations. The 1946 sugar strike brought an end to Hawai'i's paternalistic labor relations ushering in a new era of participatory democracy both on the plantations and throughout Hawai'i's political  and social institutions.

 <blockquote>Let me give you a word on the philosophy of reform. The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle. Find out just what people will submit to, and you have found the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them; and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.<br>

<strong>Clinton names Alexis Herman as Secretary of Labor</strong><br>
On Friday, December 20, President Bill Clinton named
Alexis  Herman as the new Secretary of Labor, replacing
Robert Reich.<P>

Alexis Herman was born in Mobile Alabama, graduated Xavier
University in 1969, worked for Catholic Charities, was
appointed national director of the National Minority
Women's Employment  Program in 1977.  She worked in the
Labor Department 1977-1981 as head of the Womens Bureau
the youngest person to hold that position. She has been very active in the Democratic Party, working closely with the late Ron Brown.  She was a deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee 1989-91 and worked on Pres. Clinton's 1992 transition team. She has worked in the White House since 1993 as director of the
Public Liason Office.<P>

As the only black woman in Clinton's new cabinet she received
the strong backing of Rev. Jesse Jackson and the National
Organization for Women.<P>

Hispanic groups had lobbied for Rep. Estaban Torres of California.
The AFL-CIO, which traditionally had some say in the choice
of Secretary of Labor in a Democratic Administration, had
argued for the appointment of former Sen. Harris Wofford,
whose liberal credentials go back to the Kennedy days.
They were not successful.<br>

<strong>Bill Hoshijo New Exec. of HCRC</strong><br>
William Hoshijo has been selected as the new Executive Director of the Hawai'i Civil Rights Commission, replacing Lind Tseu, who resigned effective January 15th.  Hoshijo is co-founder of the non-profit legal-aid organization, <em>Na Loio No Kanaka</em> (Lawyers for the People of Hawai'i).<p>
He was instrumental in helping to pass the legislation that established the State's Civil Rghts Commission in 1988 and for over a year has served as a commissioner. He will now be the chief administrator in charge of the State's version of the EEOC. As a deferral State, Hawai'i's Civil Right s Commission is charged with the responsibility of enforcing State and Federal workplace discrimination laws.

<strong>New Jersey Enacts Genetic Privacy Law</strong><br>
New Jersey has just passed a law barring discrimination by insurers and employers based on a person's genetic characteristics.  The Genetic Privacy Act (S 695) "strikes an important balance between protecting privacy and preventing discrimination, while ensuring that scientific and medical research are not unduly inhibited or burdened"  according Governor Christine Todd Whitman.<P>
The measure prohibits group and individual health insurers in New Jersey from denying coverage or setting premiums based on an actual or expected health condition or genetic characteristic.  The bill also amends New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination to prohibit employment decisions based on genetic information or on a job applicant's or worker's refusal to submit to or disclose the results of a genetic test.  The law also establishes that genetic information about a person cannot be obtained or retained without that person's informed consent and must be destroyed upon the person's request, except under limited circumstances.

<strong>Job Applicant's Privacy Suit</strong><br>
A New York man who interviewed for a job with the U.S. Postal Service, but later said his provacy rights were violated when his interviewer did not honor his request not to call his current employer, can proceed on his Provacy Act claim, the U.S. District Court for Western New York ruled.<P>
The applicant had taken a civil service test wit the Postal Service in 1988, but as of 1993 was working as a management trainee for Lewis General Tires.  When he learned of a job opening at the Postal Service he submitted an application in 1994 and was interviewed.  He listed his current employer on the application form but checked the "no" in response to whether he wanted his current employer to be contacted by the Postal Service.  Nevertheless, the Postal Service interviewer called Lewis General Tires and told them of the application, after which the applicat was fired by the Tire Company.<P>
The court, on the other hand, rejected the applicant's attempt to hold the interviewer personally liable, which would have been possible if the court had held that his right to privacy derived from the Constitution.

<strong>California Adopts Nation's First Standard to Prevent Repetitive Motion Injuries</strong><br>
On November 14, California's OSH Standards Boards adopted by unanimous vote a new regulation designed to minimize repetitive motion injuries.  The news standard exempts employers with nine or fewer workers and contains several other concessions to business representatives.  The final regulation is triggered only when two workers performing identical tasks at the same work site have been diagnosed with repetitive motion injuries within a 12 month period<p>

Adoption of the standard was intended to bring the board into compliance with a court-ordered deadline that came out of a lawsuit filed by the California Labor Federation.  But Tom Rankin, president of the state's Labor Federation, plans to file a challenge to the standard which he believes has been so watered down by the board as to be meaningless.<P>

<strong>Employer Bargaining Goals for 1997</strong><br>
According to the Bureau of National Affairs' latest annual survey of employers, the majority of firms negotiating contracts in 1997 will be seeking to hold wage adjustments between 2.0 percent and 3.9 percent per year.<P>
Collective bargaining agreements commonly provide for employer payment of a variety of insurance benefits. BNA's survey revealed that nearly all responding companies reported their current agreements include life insurance, hospital coverage, and surgical insurance provisions (88 percent each).  Most contracts (85 percent) also provide coverage for doctor visits, mental health care (82 percent), prescription drugs (81 percent), sickness and accident/short-term disability (80 percent), accidental death or dismemberment (79 percent), and dental care (77 percent).  In addition to their attempts to keep wage adjustments under 4 percent this year, 42 percent of the surveyed firms will seek to raise deductibles, co-payments, or employee premium contributions for some or all of their insurance benefits.<p>

Popular non-cost bargaining proposals will relate to policy and program proposals, many of which are affected by state and federal laws that prohibit "protected class" discrimination.  Among the most popular in negotiated agreements, BNA found the following:<P>

<strong>Machinists' Union Sues Disney for Libel</strong><br>
Actor Mel Gibson's on-screen tusssel with an airline mechanis' union in the movie "Ranson" has resulted in a libel suit against Walt Disney Co.   The International Association of Machinists ans Areospace Workers (IAM) is seeking compensatory damages of more that $50 million and punitive damages of more than $150 million for defamation in its portrayal of the union as a corrupt organization.<P>
In the film, Gibson playes a rogue airline executive whose son is kidnapped and held for a $2 million ransom. Efforts to get the boy back are complicated by the fact that Gibson's character is under investigation for bribing a top official of the "Machinists' Union" in order to win labor peace.<P>
John J. Walsh, an attorney for the Machinists, said the words "machinists' union" are widely known to refer to his client.

<center><H2>Tahitian Trade Unionists to Visit Hawai'i</H2></center>
Nineteen leaders of Tahiti's Labor Movement were arrested in 1995 for their protests of French nuclear testing in the Pacific.

According to Amnesty Internationl's web-site [<A HREF ="http://www.amnesty.se/aixweb96/29de.htm">http://www.amnesty.se/aixweb96/29de.htm </A>]:
<blockquote>
On 9 September 16 trade unionists were detained by members of the <em>gendarmerie nationale</em>. Officers in combat dress burst into the <em>A Tia I Mua</em> union headquarters shortly before a press conference. The authorities claimed that the arrests were in connection with the civil disturbances of 6 September at Faaaa airport. These followed mass protests and violence in Tahiti as a result of the nuclear testing at Mururoa.  The unions Secretary General, Hiro Tefaarere, claimed he was kicked and punched by the officers. Henri Temaititahio of the <em>Office des Postes et Telecommunications</em> was reportedly knocked unconscious with a truncheon. After his release later that day he collapsed and was hospitalized, suffering from a progressive paralysis of the left side of his body. All the detainees were handcuffed behind their backs and stacked face downwards in a military lorry which took them to the gendarmerie barracks. The detainees were then reportedly forced to kneel in the parking area of the barracks, still handcuffed behind their backs and their faces to the ground for approximately 45 minutes.</blockquote>

"A Tia I Mua" is a confederation representing primarily public sector unions in Tahiti, and "The Democratic and Independent Union Confederation of Polynesian Workers" is a private sector union that has organized hotels and supermarkets there.  From January 12 to the 19th, three representatives from these two Tahitian trade union confederations will be visiting O'ahu to meet with Labor union leadership here and discuss their plight.<p>  
Unable to afford financial support for this visit, CLEAR wishes to thank the following local unions for their generous support: HSTA, HGEA-AFSCME Local 152, UFCW Local 480, HERE Local 5,  Laborers Local 368, Carpenters Local 745, and Teamsters Local 996.<p>
A special series of public service TV commercials have been prepared and are now airing in Hawai'i to acquaint the general public with the issues at steak in their protest.  Labor groups that may be interested in meeting with the Tahitian visitors during their brief stay, may contact CLEAR at 956-7145 and leave a message for Dr. Boyd.

1996 marks the 50th year since the Great Hawai'i Sugar Strike that in large degree and forever changed Hawai'i economically, politically, and socially.  About twenty six thousand sugar workers and their families, 76 thousand people in all, began a 79-day strike on September 1, 1946 that completely shut down 33 of Hawai'i's 34 plantations. The 1946 sugar strike brought an end to Hawai'i's paternalistic labor relations ushering in a new era of participatory democracy both on the plantations and throughout Hawai'i's political  and social institutions.

 <blockquote>Let me give you a word on the philosophy of reform. The whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle. Find out just what people will submit to, and you have found the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them; and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.<br>

<strong>Clinton names Alexis Herman as Secretary of Labor</strong><br>
On Friday, December 20, President Bill Clinton named
Alexis  Herman as the new Secretary of Labor, replacing
Robert Reich.<P>

Alexis Herman was born in Mobile Alabama, graduated Xavier
University in 1969, worked for Catholic Charities, was
appointed national director of the National Minority
Women's Employment  Program in 1977.  She worked in the
Labor Department 1977-1981 as head of the Womens Bureau
the youngest person to hold that position. She has been very active in the Democratic Party, working closely with the late Ron Brown.  She was a deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee 1989-91 and worked on Pres. Clinton's 1992 transition team. She has worked in the White House since 1993 as director of the
Public Liason Office.<P>

As the only black woman in Clinton's new cabinet she received
the strong backing of Rev. Jesse Jackson and the National
Organization for Women.<P>

Hispanic groups had lobbied for Rep. Estaban Torres of California.
The AFL-CIO, which traditionally had some say in the choice
of Secretary of Labor in a Democratic Administration, had
argued for the appointment of former Sen. Harris Wofford,
whose liberal credentials go back to the Kennedy days.
They were not successful.<br>

He was instrumental in helping to pass the legislation that established the State's Civil Rghts Commission in 1988 and for over a year has served as a commissioner. He will now be the chief administrator in charge of the State's version of the EEOC. As a deferral State, Hawai'i's Civil Right s Commission is charged with the responsibility of enforcing State and Federal workplace discrimination laws.

<strong>New Jersey Enacts Genetic Privacy Law</strong><br>
New Jersey has just passed a law barring discrimination by insurers and employers based on a person's genetic characteristics.  The Genetic Privacy Act (S 695) "strikes an important balance between protecting privacy and preventing discrimination, while ensuring that scientific and medical research are not unduly inhibited or burdened"  according Governor Christine Todd Whitman.<P>
The measure prohibits group and individual health insurers in New Jersey from denying coverage or setting premiums based on an actual or expected health condition or genetic characteristic.  The bill also amends New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination to prohibit employment decisions based on genetic information or on a job applicant's or worker's refusal to submit to or disclose the results of a genetic test.  The law also establishes that genetic information about a person cannot be obtained or retained without that person's informed consent and must be destroyed upon the person's request, except under limited circumstances.

<strong>Job Applicant's Privacy Suit</strong><br>
A New York man who interviewed for a job with the U.S. Postal Service, but later said his provacy rights were violated when his interviewer did not honor his request not to call his current employer, can proceed on his Provacy Act claim, the U.S. District Court for Western New York ruled.<P>
The applicant had taken a civil service test wit the Postal Service in 1988, but as of 1993 was working as a management trainee for Lewis General Tires.  When he learned of a job opening at the Postal Service he submitted an application in 1994 and was interviewed.  He listed his current employer on the application form but checked the "no" in response to whether he wanted his current employer to be contacted by the Postal Service.  Nevertheless, the Postal Service interviewer called Lewis General Tires and told them of the application, after which the applicat was fired by the Tire Company.<P>
The court, on the other hand, rejected the applicant's attempt to hold the interviewer personally liable, which would have been possible if the court had held that his right to privacy derived from the Constitution.

<strong>California Adopts Nation's First Standard to Prevent Repetitive Motion Injuries</strong><br>
On November 14, California's OSH Standards Boards adopted by unanimous vote a new regulation designed to minimize repetitive motion injuries.  The news standard exempts employers with nine or fewer workers and contains several other concessions to business representatives.  The final regulation is triggered only when two workers performing identical tasks at the same work site have been diagnosed with repetitive motion injuries within a 12 month period<p>

Adoption of the standard was intended to bring the board into compliance with a court-ordered deadline that came out of a lawsuit filed by the California Labor Federation.  But Tom Rankin, president of the state's Labor Federation, plans to file a challenge to the standard which he believes has been so watered down by the board as to be meaningless.<P>

<strong>Employer Bargaining Goals for 1997</strong><br>
According to the Bureau of National Affairs' latest annual survey of employers, the majority of firms negotiating contracts in 1997 will be seeking to hold wage adjustments between 2.0 percent and 3.9 percent per year.<P>
Collective bargaining agreements commonly provide for employer payment of a variety of insurance benefits. BNA's survey revealed that nearly all responding companies reported their current agreements include life insurance, hospital coverage, and surgical insurance provisions (88 percent each).  Most contracts (85 percent) also provide coverage for doctor visits, mental health care (82 percent), prescription drugs (81 percent), sickness and accident/short-term disability (80 percent), accidental death or dismemberment (79 percent), and dental care (77 percent).  In addition to their attempts to keep wage adjustments under 4 percent this year, 42 percent of the surveyed firms will seek to raise deductibles, co-payments, or employee premium contributions for some or all of their insurance benefits.<p>

Popular non-cost bargaining proposals will relate to policy and program proposals, many of which are affected by state and federal laws that prohibit "protected class" discrimination.  Among the most popular in negotiated agreements, BNA found the following:<P>

<strong>Machinists' Union Sues Disney for Libel</strong><br>
Actor Mel Gibson's on-screen tusssel with an airline mechanis' union in the movie "Ranson" has resulted in a libel suit against Walt Disney Co.   The International Association of Machinists ans Areospace Workers (IAM) is seeking compensatory damages of more that $50 million and punitive damages of more than $150 million for defamation in its portrayal of the union as a corrupt organization.<P>
In the film, Gibson playes a rogue airline executive whose son is kidnapped and held for a $2 million ransom. Efforts to get the boy back are complicated by the fact that Gibson's character is under investigation for bribing a top official of the "Machinists' Union" in order to win labor peace.<P>
John J. Walsh, an attorney for the Machinists, said the words "machinists' union" are widely known to refer to his client.

<strong>WITHDRAWALS</strong><P>
 All withdrawal requests must be made in person or in writing to
CCECS, Office of Student Affairs (OSA), postmarked no later than the dates
specified. You should obtain the change of registration form and, if withdrawing
after Friday, June 14, a withdrawal justification form from the Office of
Student Affairs, Sakamaki C104. A course may be dropped through Friday, June 14,
without a "W" grade being indicated on your record. Complete withdrawals before
this date will have the withdrawal action but not the course registration noted
on your record. After that date and through Friday, July 12, a course may be
dropped for cause only with the written consent of the instructor and the
approval of your college student academic services Dean or designee. Thereafter,
no withdrawals (partial or complete) will be permitted except for unusual and
extenuating circumstance beyond your control in which case you must submit
supporting documents (e.g., military orders, doctor's statement, etc.) and
secure the initial approval of your college student academic services Dean. <strong>YOU
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR your OWN COURSE WITHDRAWAL(S)</strong>. If you <strong>STOP ATTENDING CLASS
WITHOUT OFFICIALLY WITHDRAWING, You MAY RECEIVE AN "F" OR "NC" GRADE. OBTAIN A
WITHDRAWAL FORM FROM SAKAMAKI C104.</strong>

AMERICAN STUDIES (AmSt)</h2><p>

AmSt 490B	WI/Topics in American StudiesEthnicity in American Film	(3

this class to understand how this dynamic works, to analyze films which are
either portrayals of ethnicity by non-ethnic creators, or ethnic self-portraits.
It will be our purpose to recognize how such films differ, both in form and in
content, and to place the works into the context which will explicate the
process of creative choices. Repeatable.<P>

<center><h3>Two New CLEAR Services Available</H3></center>
<strong>Facilitation and Strategic Planning Retreats</strong><br>
CLEAR is now able to provide facilitation services for union meetings or meetings between the union and management where a neutral outside party is needed. There are times when it is difficult for union leaders to both conduct a meeting and fully participate in discussing the issue, especially when they are also one of the stakeholders. Using an outside facilitator enables leaders to fully participate. For the same reason it may also be useful in some situations to use an outside facilitator for certain meetings between the union and management.<P>
If it is time for your union to do some serious long-range planning, assess your current objectives and define or refine your future goals, a strategic planning retreat may be the answer. Strategic planning is a proactive step designed to objectively assess and enhance the unions effectiveness as well as prepare for and hopefully sidestep crisis situations.<P>
For more information about either of these programs contact Adrienne Valdez at CLEAR, phone 956-7145 or <A HREF = "mailto:valdez@Serv1.arthum.Hawaii.edu"><IMG SRC="Images/CLEARmailButton.GIF"> valdez@Serv1.arthum.Hawaii.edu </A>

<strong>1946: THE GREAT HAWAII SUGAR STRIKE - Rice & Roses</strong> (1996, 60 min.)<BR>
About twenty six thousand sugar workers and their families, 76 thousand people in all, began a 79-day strike on September 1, 1946 that completely shut down 33 of Hawai'i's 34 plantations. The 1946 sugar strike brought an end to Hawai'i's paternalistic labor relations ushering in a new era of
participatory democracy both on the plantations and throughout Hawai'i's
political  and social institutions. This special hour-long <em>Rice & Roses</em> documentary produced for the 50th anniversary of the strike, includes interviews with surviving strikers and their relatives and friends from all the islands who organized the food-kitchens and support committees and an array of never-before-seen photos and artifacts from a two-year research project conducted by the Center for Labor Education and Research.<P>

<A NAME ="skin"><strong>BROTHERS UNDER THE SKIN - Rice & Roses</strong> (1986, 30 min.)<BR>
Produced by the Center for Labor Education and Research and directed by Chris Conybeare and Joy Chong, this is a documentary  look at the beginning of the modern labor era in Hawai'i and the longshoremen who organized the Hilo waterfront during the 30s. The motto, <em>brothers under the skin</em> used by Harry Kamoku, revealed their desire to form a truly inter-racial union movement in which they really lived by the belief that an injury to one is an injury to all. The second half of the program features the <A HREF =  "book1.html">Hilo Massacre</A> of August 1st, 1938, where peaceful demonstrators were gassed, hosed, then shot by police as they picketed in sympathy for their brother unionists from Honolulu.<P>

More than a re-enactment, this is a telling of the story with the temperament and psychological atmosphere of labor conditions in Hilo, Hawai`i in the 1930s. The play focuses on union organizer Harry Kamoku (played by Dennis Chun), a young Chinese-Hawaiian longshoreman who put together the Hilo Longshoremen`s Association. Against formidable resistance from the Big 5 business leaders, Kamoku and the Hilo unionists formed a strong inter-racial union that was destined to grow and change labor relations and politics in Hawai`i forever.<P>

The PBS biography of A. Philip Randolph (1889-1979) one of America's most brilliant leaders, a civil rights and labor activist who, for over 40 eventful years, provided much of the organizational energy behind the struggle for African American equality, believing that the struggle to achieve economic rights was the key to advancing civil rights as well as the labor movement.  He organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, a national union of railroad porters in the 1920s, and persuaded President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to bar racial discrimination in federal hiring programs created by the New Deal.  In 1963 he led the March on Washington at the age of 74. [Produced by WETA-TV, Washington D.C.]<P>


<strong>CHICANO!: THE STRUGGLE IN THE FIELDS</strong>  (1996, 57 min)<br>
Episode 2 of a four-part series on the history of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement, chronicling the efforts of farmworkers to form a national labor union.  Under the leadership of Cesar Chavez, farmworkers launched a strike against California grape-growers in 1965, demanding better working conditions and fair wages.  In 1970, they undertook a national table grape boycott that eventually led to the first union contract in farm labor history. <P>

<strong>HARLAN COUNTY, USA </strong> (1976, 103 min, V-19)<br>
Long after the mine workers` struggles depicted in John Sayles` <em>Matewan</em>, but just thirteen years before their industry-wide struggle with Pittston, miners were fighting for their union in Kentucky. Portraying this classic twentieth century conflict between mine workers, the coal company and the local police, this film chronicles the efforts of 180 coal mining families to win a United Mine Workers contract in Harlan County. In 1976 the film won an Academy Award for Best Documentary.<P>


<strong>IF YOU DON`T COME IN SUNDAY, DON`T COME IN MONDAY</strong> (1976, 59 min, V-23)<br>
Narrated by Alexander Scourby, this is a bicentennial program cosponsored by the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Department of Labor in which the history of American Labor is documented. Photographs, documents and original and historical film footage, some shot before the turn of the century, tell the story of American labor from the landing in Virginia in 1607 through the waves of immigrants and the development of an organized labor movement. The documentary is a sobering course in labor history and in the role of government in the failures and, as this century advanced, the accomplishments of working Americans.  [Also available in 16mm film]<P>

<strong>LABOR`S TURNING POINT </strong> (1981, 44 min, V-30)<br>
A history of the Teamsters` watershed Minneapolis truckers` strike of May 1934. Using old newsreel footage, period music, and contemporary interviews of survivors, the narrator pieces together the history of the most famous Teamster strike in that union`s history. Signing up unemployed workers and activating a women`s auxiliary, Minneapolis Local 574 of the Teamsters coordinated and organized a city-wide strike involving thousands of workers. Unsupported by national Teamster President Dan Tobin, and violently attacked by the police and deputized company goons, the strike nevertheless enjoyed popular support. Produced by John de Graaf, KTCA-TV, Minnesota and Twin Cities Public Television for the University of Minnesota, Labor Education Service.<P>

<STRONG>MATEWAN</STRONG>  (1987, John Sayles - feature film: 100 min, V-36)<BR>
Matewan, West Virginia, coal mining country, was the site of an infamous massacre in 1920, when striking miners clashed with the hired thugs of the Stone Mountain Coal Co. Chris Cooper plays the IWW union man, Joe Kenehan, sent to Matewan to organize the workers. The miners have gone on strike and the company has brought in scabs:  blacks from Alabama and Italians just off the boat. Joe is finally able to convince the three groups to work together so the company is forced to hire two gunmen to get rid of Joe and break the strike. A pacifist, Joe desperately tries to avoid the armed feud that eventually erupts savagely.<P>

<strong>NEW HARVEST, OLD SHAME</strong>  (1990, 60 min, V-40)<br>
A CPB Frontline update of Edward R. Murrow`s classic 1960 documentary Harvest of Shame that revisits the migrant farm workers who annually travel from Florida to the mid-West and back. From their decrepit housing and inadequate medical benefits to the substandard wages and lack of access to ordinary labor law protections, 800,000 migrants, thirty years after Murrow`s expose, still live in labor camps and suffer working conditions as bad, if not worse, in 1990 than they did in 1960. In 1986, the Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) organized Campbell`s migrant workers, but union organizers still cannot reach the majority of the workers. Many employers resort instead to illegal aliens to keep their costs down, creating racial tensions between Black Americans, Guatemalans and Haitians. Aired on public television on April17, 1990.<P>

<strong>P.O.V.: THE UPRISING OF `34</strong> (1995, 90 min.)<br>
A fledging textile workers` union attempted unsuccessfully in 1934 to organize garment workers in the South. Originally broadcast by the Public Braodcasting System on June 27, 1995, this documentary looks at one of the greatest social upheavals in the South since the Civil War and decades before the Civil Rights movement was able to take on the great industrial bastions of economic power in the South. <P>


<strong>THE RIVER RAN RED</strong> (1993, 58 min)<br>
Blair Brown narrates this gripping account of the Homestead Lockout.  In the summer of 1892, a bitter conflict erupted at the Carnegie Steel Works in Homestead, Pennsylvania.  The nation`s largest steel maker hired a small army of Pinkerton detective agency armed guards to invade Homestead and subdue the union men and their community supporters with devasting consequences.<P>

<strong>SALT OF THE EARTH </strong> (1954, Independant Prod. - feature film, 94 min, V46)<BR>
A strong pro-labor film with a particularly sympathetic interest in the Mexican-Americans with whom it deals. True, it frankly implies that the mine operators have taken advantage of the Mexican-born or descended laborers, have forced a <em>speed up</em> in their mining techniques and given them less respectable homes than provided the so-called Anglo laborers. It slaps at brutal police tactics in dealing with the strikers and it gets in some rough, sarcastic digs at the attitude of `the bosses` and the working of the Taft-Hartley Law. (from the New York Times review by Bosley Crowther, 3-15-54)<P>



<strong>SIT DOWN AND FIGHT: WALTER REUTHER AND THE RISE OF THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS UNION </strong> (1992, 60min)<BR>  A PBS documentary produced for The American Experience series introduced by David McCullough, narrated by Tresa Hughes, written & produced by Charlotte Mitchell Zwerin.<P>

Not all courses are recognized by the VA for educational benefits. Being accepted to take course work through CCECS does not necessarily mean that students are classified students.</li></ol><p>

<strong>WITHDRAWALS</strong><P>
WITHDRAWALS All withdrawal requests must be made in person or in writing to CCECS, Office of Student Affairs (OSA), postmarked no later than the dates specified. You should obtain the change of registration form and, if withdrawing after Friday, September 13, a withdrawal justification form from the Office of Student Affairs, Sakamaki C104. A course may be dropped through Friday, September 13, without a  <B>W</b>  grade being indicated on your record. Complete withdrawals before this date will have the withdrawal action but not the course registration noted on your record. After that date and through Friday, October 11, a course may be dropped for cause only with the written consent of the instructor and the approval of your college student academic services Dean or designee. Thereafter, no withdrawals (partial or complete) will be permitted except for unusual and extenuating circumstances beyond your control in which case you must submit supporting documents (e.g., military orders, doctor's statement, etc.) and secure the initial approval of your college student academic services Dean. <strong>You are responsible for your own course withdrawals(s)</strong>. If you <strong>STOP ATTENDING CLASS WITHOUT OFFICIALLY WITHDRAWING</strong>, you <strong>may receive an  <b>F </b>   or  <B>NC</B>  grade. Obtain a withdrawal form from Sakamaki C104.</strong>

<p>
<b>Objective l: Were the facilities and equipment adequate to conduct the study ?   </b><p>

<p>

This objective is usually met, and the attainment of the objective documented, by the following:
<p>

<p>

1. Obtaining accreditation for the animal facilities by the American Association for
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). (Details on the accreditation program can
be obtained from AAALAC, 9650 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20814, Tel: 301-564-5111,
Fax: 301-564 5643). Displaying a current certificate of accreditation in the animal care facilities
is adequate proof of compliance.<p>

<p>

2. The research facilities should be able to document that the necessary equipment and
instruments to conduct the planned research are on hand and in good working order. This is
usually done by establishing and maintaining a file containing an inventory of the general
laboratory equipment, as well as a list of any special equipment or instruments which are
necessary for each protocol. <p>

<p>

3. Equipment and instruments used for any study need to be calibrated and maintained properly.
Most facilities with only a single site choose to keep one central file which catalogs the common
research equipment and appends the calibration, maintenance, and repair records for each piece
of equipment. Individual study #is need to document that equipment that requires calibration
was, in fact, calibrated at the appropriate frequency. <p>

<p>

4. The environmental conditions in the facility including temperature, humidity, and duration of
the dark/light cycles to which the animals were exposed should be clearly specified in the
protocol and should be entered in the laboratory records. This factor is so important that a central
record for the laboratory is usually inadequate, and inclusion of a summary of the environmental
conditions in the records of the study is recommended. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>

<b>Objective 2:  Were the origin, identity, condition, and keeping of the animals adequately
specified?</b><p>

<p>

How this objective is met will vary with the study, since procedures appropriate to a large rodent
study with hundreds of animals may be inappropriate for an abuse liability study in which
handlers know each animal by name and have worked with them for years. Nevertheless, certain
basic principles apply: <p>

<p>

1. Laboratory animals need to be procured in an orderly, controlled, and well-documented
fashion, usually from a well established animal breeding facility or another laboratory. The
source, species, strain and date of receipt of each shipment of animals needs to be recorded. <p>

<p>

2. Laboratory animals obtained from an outside source should be kept in quarantine for 7- 14
days before inclusion in any study. During this period animals should be observed for any
clinical sign which may warn that the animal is ill or otherwise unsuitable for inclusion in a
specific experiment. <p>

<p>

3. Each animal must be uniquely identified in the records. This is best accomplished if upon
arrival, animals are numbered upon receipt and assigned to a specific study as soon as possible
after quarantine. Needless to say, the experimental data should carry that single unique number
for that animal across all treatments, observations, and protocols.  <p>

<p>

4. Basic information about the health and condition of each animal must be followed over the
entire course of the protocol. For example, the body weight of the animals should be determined
each time any drug under investigation is administered (to avoid inadvertently giving a different
dose as the animal gains or loses weight). Those animals which are used repeatedly for many
protocols (e.g. trained monkeys) should be weighed at a periodic rate, and their health condition
assessed periodically.<p>

<p>

5. Animals in ongoing protocols need to be protected against exposure to injury due to outside
influences. Protecting the health status of the procured animals is important to safeguard the
health of other animals in ongoing protocols in the same facilities. Animals should be treated
prophylactically with vaccines against diseases to which the particular species is most
susceptible. <p>

<p>

6. Diet should be controlled and standardized.  Written standing protocols should be kept for the
maintenance of each strain or species studied and a copy appended as appropriate to individual
study reports. This is so important in some cases that it is recommended that copies of the
procurement receipts for laboratory chows be maintained in the file with the dietary protocols. If
special diet is given to any batch of animals (i.e., to deplete a specific neurotransmitter to
examine its role on the development of drug seeking behavior), that batch of animals should not
be mixed with other animals receiving normal diet.  It is also highly recommended that the
handling facility have multiple redundant procedures such as putting a display in the handling
area identifying animals on special diets as well as labeling the chow and the individual cages.
<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Objective 3:  Was the protocol specific, unequivocal and complete prior to starting the
study?<p>

</b> <p>

This is the most critical area in evaluating a study. It is common for multiple versions of any
given protocol to circulate during the planning of any given experiment. By the start of the
experiment the principal investigator and the post-doctoral fellows and staff have all but
memorized the study and are extremely loath to write a detailed final version of the protocol. It is
essential to realize that it may be several years before the FDA staff receive the results of the
study, and the written protocol is the primary record against which the conduct of the study will
be judged. Therefore:<p>

<p>

1. Before conducting any study, it is necessary that a protocol of the experiment be complete.
The protocol should refer to the name and qualifications of the researchers and their supervisors,
number of animals per group, doses, controls and parameters to be evaluated. Every protocol
must identify a single principal investigator or study director who is personally and
professionally responsible for the conduct of the study. <p>

<p>

2. Researchers or technicians who will be conducting the study should read the protocol before
the experiment, and I is not inappropriate if they submit a signed copy of the final version of the
protocol as they understood and executed it as an appendix to the master file at the end of the
study.<p>

<p>

3. The final protocol should be specific. It should include the number of animals to be use for
each condition, the doses to be used, the parameters to be evaluated, the outcomes to be
measured, how the data will be collected, stored, checked for quality and analyzed.   If off-site
analyses are planned (i.e. blood will be drawn to relate the abuse potential with the plasma
levels), one should indicate how samples will be handled, analyzed, and their identity verified in
the protocol. It is advised that all preliminary experimental designs and protocols be discarded
prior to embarking on the study and that ONLY the final version of the protocol be retained in
the animal facility and on file. <p>

<p>

4. Plans for data management and analysis need to be specified in the protocol. If any animal has
been used in a previous study, appropriate reference should be made to that study. <p>

<p>

5. Any routine procedure that may affect the condition of the animals needs to be specified, (i.e.
procedures adopted for anesthesia) should be discussed in the protocol.  <p>

<p>

6. It is expected that no study ever goes as planned. Deviations from the protocol need to be
indicated in the laboratory data book in an imperishable format as described below.  <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Objective 4:  Were personnel qualified by training and experience to conduct the
experiment? <p>

</b><p>

All personnel who conduct scientific and clinical research should have academic credentials,
records of training, or evidence of experience appropriate to their duties. For example: <p>

<p>

1. It is assumed that the study director and the principal researchers are aware of the scientific
basis and methodologies applicable for the specific study. It is expected that all individuals
involved in the design or analysis of the study will have a curricula vitae indicating prior
experience in experimental and or clinical research relevant to the proposed study. <p>

<p>

2. Laboratories involved in training should have a designated individual responsible for each
individual in a training status (each junior must have a senior). If the data collected by an
individual in a training status is part of a submission for regulatory approval, such data should be
countersigned by the supervisor or mentor. No responsible senior may claim to supervise an
inappropriate number of individuals in a training status, and should be prepared to document
claims of personal supervision of more than five trainees.  <p>

<p>

3. All personnel, including trainees, should be acquainted with the protocol and experimental
procedures. If any protocol involves the use of hazardous materials, carcinogenic compounds,
biohazards, or radio tracers, personnel should have documented training, experience, or course
work to ensure proper handling of dangerous materials. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Objective 5:  Were adequate records kept of how the study was actually performed? 
</b><p>

 <p>

To review a study it is essential that the FDA scientific staff understand exactly what was done
in every particular. As has been mentioned, it is likely that few members of the original research
team will be available at the facility at the time of review. Therefore it is recommended that the
following records or their equivalent be maintained: <p>

<p>

1. All experimental data, animal procurement data, weight, gender, diet given, duration of
quarantine, animal room temperature, humidity, names of the researchers etc. need to be
recorded in an imperishable laboratory note book.  If computerized records are kept, hard copy
printouts should be made at regular intervals, verified, and attested to as described below. <p>

<p>

2. Upon completion of the data collection for each experiment, the principal investigator or study
director should verify the raw data with his signature and the date of that action. All data should
be recorded in duplicate and one copy should be kept by the study director and the other copy by
the researcher or technician who was most directly involved with the experiment.                          
  <p>

3. As a general rule, all study data should be reviewed and validated by at least two individuals,
both of whom are responsible for the scientific validity of the results. In the event the study
director is the principal investigator and conducts the experiment for himself, he or she should
validate the results with a peer of equal or superior academic position who is willing to attest to
the validity of the work. <p>

<p>

4. All records must be kept until reviewed.  If the data are submitted to the FDA for product
approval purpose (IND/NDA submission) such data and records should be made available to
FDA personnel for up to four years after approval of the submission.  <p>

<p>

5. Any submission of study results to the FDA in either an IND or an NDA should identify by
name and position the person who will be responsible for the custody of the study records and
will furnish the records upon request to agency personnel.   <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Objective 6:  Were medications and investigational drugs handled properly?</b>   <p>

<p>

Every investigator who has handled investigational or blinded medications in research knows of
the potential problems involved in mis-identification or contamination of research supplies. FDA
scientific staff need to be able to assure themselves, from the records, that the right drugs were
given to the correct animals in the right dose at the right time. Therefore: <p>

<p>

1. The research facility should keep and store sufficient amount of drugs needed for the research
while avoiding long-term storage of excess quantities. All investigational drugs should be
properly labeled and stored under recommended conditions and the label should include the
source of the drug (code # or lot #). <p>

<p>

2. A log book or file should be maintained for each investigational drug to indicate source, lot or
code number, and amount of the drug received for testing and the amount used for each
experiment.  Each time the drug substance is weighed for the purpose of the experiment, it
should be noted in the log book with signature of the person who weighed or used it and the date. 
Accounting for clinical supplies is an essential part of quality control and it is expected that the
amount used will be equivalent to the amount received after making due allowance for wastage.
<p>

 <p>

3. After each experiment the unused drug or its solution should be labeled and stored
appropriately if it has to be used for the next experiment, or discarded if it is unusable. The
investigator should obtain stability information for any drug or solution which is kept for
repeated use.<p>

<p>

4. If prepared drug or solution needs to be discarded, the approximate volume or amount should
be recorded in the log book.  Unless the solution is of known environmental hazard and/or
radioactive, it can be flushed under water into the sink (unless to do so is contrary to local law or
facility practices). Compounds which possess known abuse potential should be flushed in the
presence of a peer, the study director, or a designated person.  <p>

<p>

5. Radiolabelled or carcinogenic drugs, biohazards, solutions, tissues used with Radiolabelled
drug substance, spillage, and secretions should be discarded into specified containers in a
manner recommended for such disposal in appropriate regulations.  <p>

It is possible that many drugs which are candidates for abuse liability testing may have great
potential to induce addiction and chemical dependency. In order to ensure that these drugs do not
reach the population from the testing laboratories, appropriate measures need to be taken. These
may include:<p>

<p>


<ul>
  <li>    1.  Keeping the smallest practical quantity of the drug at the testing site.    </li>
  <li>    2.  Keeping the main clinical supply in a safe place and under lock and key.  (The keys
should
be made available only to the study director and the principal investigator).   </li>
  <li>    3.  Any individual engaged in research on abuse liability testing of already scheduled
drugs
(as comparator or controls) should follow the guidelines of 21 CFR 1300 on registration of
manufacturer, distributors and dispensers of controlled substances.  </li>
</ul>
<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Objective 7:  Were the responsibilities of each party for the work clearly attributed and
accepted? </b><p>

<p>

One purpose of this guideline is to help the investigator (or study director) assure a commercial
sponsor of a protocol that the FDA is likely to accept the results of a study for review. In the
GLP regulations there are specific requirements that toxicological studies be audited by a
reviewer independent of the organization who attests to the validity of the work.  This level of
independent review is not appropriate to properly conducted academic research, but both
sponsors and investigators have specific responsibilities for work that is to be submitted to the
FDA.<p>

<p>

The responsibility of the sponsor of the research is to select qualified investigators, provide them
with the information and material required to conduct an investigation properly, ensure proper
monitoring of the research, ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the
investigational plan and protocols, and that appropriate records are maintained and available for
studies conducted in support of submissions to the agency.  <p>

<p>

Specifically, sponsors are usually expected to:<p>
<p>
a.  Select only investigators qualified by training and experience to investigate the drug.  <p>

b.  Obtain the following before permitting an investigator to begin participation in an
investigation intended to support submissions to the agency:   <p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>    A signed statement with the name and address of the investigator;          </li>
  <li>    The name and address of any animal welfare agency, review board, committee or other
body tasked with oversight of animal research at the facility;        </li>
  <li>    The name and address of any research facility(ies) where the investigation(s) will be
conducted;     </li>
  <li>    A commitment by the investigator that he or she: </li>
</ol>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>(a) Will conduct the study(ies) in accordance with the relevant, current protocol(s) and will
only make changes in a protocol after notifying the sponsor, except when necessary to protect
safety of the animals or the investigators or the validity of the research; </li>
  <li>(b) Will personally conduct or supervise the described investigation(s); </li>
  <li>(c) Will report to the sponsor adverse experiences that occur in the course of the
investigation;</li>
  <li>(d) Will establish and maintain such records as are required to support the proposed study
in later submissions of the data to the FDA; </li>
  <li>(e) Will open the records of the study and the physical facility to inspection by
representatives of the sponsor and the FDA as required to support the validity of the data. </li>
</ul>
<p>

5.  Monitor the progress of all ongoing investigations being conducted that are intended to
support submissions to the agency. If a sponsor discovers by such monitoring that the
investigator is not complying with the research agreement, or is not properly conducting the
study, and such non-compliance cannot be resolved, the sponsor is expected to discontinue
shipment of drug and support of such research and notify the agency of this event. <p>

<p>

6.  Maintain adequate records of drug shipments to the investigator, verify the existence of
appropriate licenses for the possession and use of any controlled substances, verify the
appropriate return of disposal of investigational supplies, and retain such records for the
appropriate periods as elsewhere specified. <p>

<p>

7.  Maintain the records of the study and make them available to FDA inspectors or to review
personnel as appropriate.<p>

<p>

Although the majority of the burden for record-keeping and quality assurance usually rests with
a commercial sponsor who plans to use the data in support of a commercial application, all of the
duties of the sponsor as described above may be met by the investigator, if they have made
provision for independent monitoring of the study by a peer as described above. <p>

Nevertheless, it is a principle within the agency that a scientist assume personal responsibility for
the integrity and validity of his or her research. The principal investigator (or designated study
director) is responsible for the conduct of the study, the welfare of the animals, acquisition,
control and disposal of the investigational drug(s), submission of adequate progress reports to the
sponsor, immediate notification of any findings that may directly reflect on the safety of the drug
in human studies, and timely submission of the final report.  This may be accomplished in a
number of ways, but the most convenient is for the principal investigator, study director, or
independent peer to submit a properly completed copy of the enclosed "Good Research
Practices" checklist which includes a statement that he has personal custody of the raw data,
verified its scientific accuracy, and will maintain the data and make it available to the FDA for
the appropriate period. A copy of this checklist signed by the investigator, may be submitted to
the FDA along with the data, and provides substantial evidence of compliance with these
guidelines. <p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

<b>Objective 8:  Was the validity of the work confirmed by adequate supervision?   <p>

</b><p>

The validity of scientific results is usually determined by how well the findings withstand careful
scientific scrutiny. Unlike most general scientific research which is either confirmed or
disproved by future work by other scientists, most medication development work will never be
replicated (much of it may not even be published). This means that the FDA review is the only
substantive peer review such work will ever receive. Acceptance of this responsibility by the
agency has led to the establishment of a Division of Scientific Investigations that inspects the
facilities, records, and results of studies submitted to the FDA. Not all studies are selected for
audit but every site that conducts studies which will be submitted to the FDA in support of an
IND or NDA must allow inspection. At such an inspection the investigator will determine the
extent to which the research met the objectives of these guidelines.  In general, this will be
accomplished by: <p>
 <p>
<ol>
  <li>Examination of the facilities and verification of accreditation. </li>
  <li>Examination of animal procurement, quarantine and identification. </li>
  <li>Verification of proper housing, proper anesthesia and humane treatment.   </li>
  <li>Comparison of the protocol at the site against the last version filed with the FDA.  </li>
  <li>Inspection of the logbooks for compliance with the protocol. </li>
  <li>Determination of how frequently animals are entered in multiple protocols. </li>
  <li>Examination for evidence of adequate supervision by the principal investigator.  </li>
  <li>Evidence of good data handling, verification, and quality assurance procedures. </li>
  <li>Notification of the study director of any deficiencies.</li>
  <li>Issuance of a certificate of satisfaction for the study.</li>
</ol>
<p>

   Unlike the current GLP requirements, any research or testing done under these guidelines need
not be certified by an independent quality assurance unit, however, either the commercial
sponsor or the study director will verify the overall integrity, quality of the study and record
keeping as described above. <p>

<p>

Although it is extremely rare in academic faculties, there are occasions where such serious
deficiencies are found on inspection as to make it impossible to be certain of the validity of the
results produced by a given laboratory. In such cases the quality assurance unit of FDA will
report the deficiencies of the facilities and other identified problems related to the study to the
review division within FDA as well as to the study director, principal investigator, academic
institution, and sponsor. The responsible parties are required to respond within six months and
explain how the deficiencies with this and future studies will be addressed. Failure to provide
satisfactory response to the deficiency letters or to reach an agreement with the agency as to how
to correct the situation may disqualify the laboratory from conducting any studies intended for
submission to the FDA until the situation is resolved.  <p>

<p>

This guideline has been proposed to assure the high quality of research and testing in the
evaluation of the behavioral pharmacology or the abuse liability assessment of new medications
in academic settings. Any suggestions should be addressed to:   <p>

</CENTER>
<BR>         
On August 17, 1989, EPA published in the Federal Register revisions to the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPS) (54 FR
34052). This revision included changes that the Food and Drug Administration made to its GLPS
(September 4, 1987; 52 FR 33768) and expanded the scope of the regulations to include data
submissions which had previously not been under GLPS. The expansion of GLPS to include
field studies has brought many facilities under GLPS for the first time while also making the
standards applicable to entirely different types of testing environments than had previously been
the case.<P>
         
Since the publication of the revised rule in 1989, EPA has received many questions from persons
who wish clarification regarding the applicability of the rule to their activities. These questions
have ranged from simply asking whether the work they are doing is required to comply to
technical questions regarding how the standards should be applied in the context of field as
opposed to laboratory studies. Many written replies have been made to persons who have
submitted specific questions in writing to EPA. Copies of specific correspondence have been
provided upon request.<P>
         
Notwithstanding, the correspondence file is of limited usefulness to other persons since the
issues addressed are often specific to a particular situation. There have been requests for a
general guidance document regarding EPA's FIFRA GLP policy. The following questions and
answers have been prepared by the Policy and Grants Division of the Office of Compliance
Monitoring to serve as official written policy for the regulated community.<P>

<H4><B>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</H4></A>
</CENTER>
<BR>     
<H3>APPLICABILITY</H3>
<BR>         
<I>1. What is the applicability of GLPS to work in progress at the time that the rule
         became effective?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         The GLPS apply to all study-related work which is performed on or after the
         effective date of the rule. Studies in progress must be in compliance with GLPS
         from the effective date onward. A statement of compliance or non-compliance
         must accompany the final study report for such a study. This statement must
         either (1) state that the study was in compliance with GLPS, (2) describe in detail
         how it did not comply with GLPS, or (3) state that the submitter did not sponsor
         or conduct the study and does not know its compliance status. The statement
         must account for compliance or deviations with both the previous GLP rule
         (effective 1984), and the current rule (effective 1989), as applicable.<P>
         <BR>
<B><I>2.  If a study was in progress on October 16, 1989, must it have a protocol? What
         parts of the study should the protocol address?</I></B><P>
<BR>         
         All portions of the study performed on or after the effective date must be
         performed according to a written protocol as provided at 40 CFR 160.120. That
         protocol need only address those parts of the study performed on or after the
         effective date. Please note that if a study was subject to the 1984 GLPS, a
         protocol was required for all parts of the study conducted after the effective date
         of that rule. The compliance statement submitted with that study's report must
         specify in detail those study activities which were not performed in accordance
         with GLPS.<P>
         <BR>
<B><I> 3.  Current reregistration procedures involve submission of data that resulted from
         studies performed prior to the effective date of GLPS.  Do GLPS apply to such
         data, and if so, how?</I></B><P>
<BR>         
         Any data presently submitted in support of a pesticide research or marketing
         permit must be accompanied by a true and correct compliance statement as
         described at 40 CFR 160.12 regardless of when the study was performed.
         Therefore, data submitted to meet reregistration requirements are required to be
         accompanied with a true and correct compliance statement informing EPA in
         detail of all differences between the practices used in the study and those require~
         by GLPS. It is not unlawful to truthfully admit that studies supporting such
         submissions did not comply with GLPS, nor would such an admission necessarily
         lead to rejection of the data. The compliance statement will help the Agency to
         determine the reliability of the data based on current data requirements. Note
         that such an admission may nevertheless result in an enforcement action if they
         indicate that an unlawful act has occurred. For example, other regulations, i.e.,
         books and records as stated at 40 CFR 169.2(k), require retention of raw data
         generated in support of registered pesticides prior to the effective date of GLPS.
         Admitting to destruction of records would not exclude the Agency from taking
         enforcement actions for the books and records violation.<P>
<BR> 
<B><I>4. Do GLPS apply to data used to support tolerance petitions?</I></B><P>
<BR>
         Yes. The scope of the regulations as stated at 40 CFR 160.1 require that studies
         conducted to develop data pursuant to sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food,
         Drug, and Cosmetic Act be performed in accordance with GLPS.<P>
<BR>         
<B><I>5. Are studies conducted under the Interregional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4)
         program to support the registration of minor uses subject to the GLPS?</I></B><P>
<BR>         
         Yes.<P>
<BR>         
<B><I>6. Do GLPS apply to weather data and soil analysis data?</I></B><P>
<BR>         
         Any data which are collected as part of a study listed in 40 CFR 160.1 must be
         collected according to GLPS. This includes weather data and soil analyses which
         are collected as part of a larger study which must comply with GLPS. If non-study
         data such as local weather data are cited in a study report, and the study report
         clearly indicates that such data were not gathered as part of the study, GLPS
         would not apply to such data.<P>
<BR>         
<B><I>7. What applicability do GLPS have when State, Federal, or independent
        laboratories are used to provide soil or weather data for GLP studies?</I></B><P>
<BR>         
         GLPS are applicable in such circumstances if such data are gathered as part of a
         FIFRA study. Only where such data are gathered independently of the study, and
         the study report clearly indicates that such data were not gathered as part of the
         study, would GLPS not apply.<P>

<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME= def ><H3><B>DEFINITIONS</B></H3></A>
<BR>         
<B><I>8.  Will EPA issue separate GLP standards for field testing as opposed to laboratory
         testing?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         The expansion of GLPS to cover field studies was based on the need to assure
         identical standards for all data submitted to EPA under FIFRA, and on the
         determination that the GLPS are technically general enough to cover virtually any
         type of research environment. EPA does not intend to issue separate standards.<P>
         
<BR>         
<B><I>9.  Can an experiment be divided into more than one study, based on where or when
         the work is performed, or the phase of the experimental work?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         Under GLPS, the term "study" refers to an experiment to determine or predict the
         effects or characteristics of a test substance. EPA considers a study to be
         composed of all of the necessary elements of research which are performed in
         order to obtain the reported results. If the elements of research consist of several
         phases of work which must be taken in the context of each other to get
         meaningful results, they are all considered to be elements of the same study. An
         example of this would be where one laboratory treats a test system with a test
         substance and sends the treated test system to another laboratory for analysis.<P>
         
         If the experiment involves treatment of test systems in several different locations,
         the experiment may be considered to be composed of either one study
         encompassing all locations or several studies each involving one or more locations.
         In the latter case, however, it would be necessary that each separate study stand
         entirely by itself, i.e., meet all of the criteria of a study. There would have to be
         separate compliance statements for each, separate tracking on master schedules,
         separate quality assurance inspections, etc. Each study would have to have a
         study director (and only one study director), although it may be possible for the
         same study director to oversee several of such studies at the same time. Finally,
         where several studies are compiled for submission, the submission must include
         true and correct compliance statements for each study involved in the submission.<P>
         
<BR>         
<B><I>10. What is EPA's formal policy on certifying copies of raw data?  Must each page be
         signed and dated?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         EPA stated in the preamble to the August 17, 1989 rule (54 FR 34066) that
         acceptable alternatives to signing and dating each page may be devised and
         incorporated into standard operating procedures. EPA did not further elaborate
         in order to allow each testing facility flexibility in implementing SOPs that would
         provide adequate assurances within its facilities. Note that EPA may inspect the
         original records, which must be maintained by the registrant as provided at 40
         CFR 169.2(k), to assure that they have been kept and that the copies are correct.<P>
         
<BR>         
<B><I>11. Is it permissible to discard original raw data worksheets after exact copies have
         been made?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         Destruction of original raw data is prohibited. The registrant is responsible for
         maintaining all original raw data as specified at 40 CFR 169.2(k). Copies of data
         may be used to assure compliance with GLPS at the level of the testing facility,
         but EPA requires that the registrant maintain all original data that support a
         study.<P>
         
 <BR>         
<B><I>12. What type of sponsor-testing facility communication is considered to be raw data
         which must be archived at the end of the study?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         All records of sponsor-testing facility communication which occur as part of the
         activities of a study are considered to be raw data, as defined at 40 CFR 160.3.
         This includes memoranda, letters, and records of telephone conversations which
         occur during the course of the study. Communication conducted prior to the
         study (i.e., before the protocol is signed) or following the completion of the study
         (i.e., after the report is signed) would not normally be considered to be raw data.
         Note that certain records not specific to a particular study which are generated
         when the study is not in progress still need to be retained to prove that study's
         compliance with GLPS. Examples include records of a sponsor's notifying a
         facility of the need to comply with GLPS as required at 40 CFR 160.10, and
         records of facility documents such as standard operating procedures.<P>

 <BR>         
<B><I>13. Many field studies involve more than one technical phase, each involving different
         personnel and different methodologies, often by different contractors. Concern
         has been raised aver the difficulty for a single individual to physically oversee all
         phases and to be expert in all techniques involved. Within the same study, is it
         acceptable to assign a different study director to different phases?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         No. Each study must have a single study director who represents the single source
         of study control. This is explicitly stated in the GLPS at 40 CFR 160.33. A single
         point of control is necessary to the integrity of the study and to avoid the potential
         for conflicting instructions and confusion in study implementation.<P>
 <BR>         
<B><I>14. If there can only be one study director assigned to a study, is it acceptable to
         assign  field directors" and "analytical directors" to manage the work which
         involves different phases and/or locations?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         The assignment of responsibility for the study to the study director need not
         interfere with ordinary delegation of authority necessary for the performance of
         study duties. Any authority accepted by persons other than the study director
         does not reduce the study director's overall responsibility for the study.<P>

<BR>         
<B><I>15. Is it acceptable to inspect study-related procedures at a time other than when the
         study is ongoing?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         The GLPS state at 40 CFR 160.35(a) that a testing facility shall have a Quality
         Assurance Unit (QAU) that shall monitor each study to assure management that
         the facilities, equipment, personnel, methods, practices, records, and controls are
         in conformance with the GLPS. The GLPS further state at 40 CFR 160.35(b)(3)
         that the QAU shall inspect each study at intervals adequate to ensure the integrity
         of the study.<P>
         
         Clearly, the QAU must conduct inspections adequate to provide the assurances
         required at 40 CFR 160.35(a) and, in the course of so doing, must inspect each
         study at least once. All parameters must be verified adequate for each site, but it
         is acceptable to use inspections conducted during other studies to provide
         necessary assurances. It is also acceptable to use inspections conducted when no
         study is in progress to assure that methods, personnel, etc. at a particular site are
         in conformance with GLPS. However, acceptability of such inspections is
         contingent on assuring that the facilities, personnel, methods, etc., which are
         inspected are representative of those used in the study. Note that it is necessary
         to reinspect facilities periodically to account for changes in personnel, equipment
         etc. Finally, no matter how complete QAU inspectional coverage is regarding the
         sites involved in a study, it is still necessary to conduct at least one inspection of
         study activities while the study is in progress.<P>
<BR>         
<B><I>16. What would constitute adequate inspection of the ongoing study? Would an audit
         of the protocol or of data records be adequate?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         At least one inspection must be conducted while the study is in progress. Under
         GLPS, the QAU monitoring of protocols, data records, or other documentation
         phases of a study are important just as is directly observing the experimental
         phase of the study. However, the GLPS state at 40 CFR 160.35(b)(3) that
         inspections must be done at intervals adequate to ensure the integrity of the study,
         and further, at 40 CFR 160.35(b)(4), that periodic status reports noting problems
         and corrective actions be submitted to management.<P>
         
         An audit of a study protocol would be of very limited utility since the subsequent
         reporting would be to management which, in all likelihood, has already reviewed
         the protocol. Data record audits would also be of very limited utility since they
         may occur after all experimental work is completed -- in short, too late for any
         corrective actions to be taken. This problem also applies to protocol audits
         conducted after the experimental phase is completed. Thus, reliance solely on
         such types of audits would not meet the GLP requirements as stated at 40 CFR
         160.35.<P>

         As discussed at 40 CFR 160.47(b) test substance mixture storage areas must be
         stored in separate areas from the areas where test systems are kept. However,
         working quantities of test substance mixtures need not be stored in separate
         rooms from test systems. Separate areas within the same room may be designated
         for test substance mixture storage and test systems as long as the separation is
         adequate to preserve the integrity of the study and the identity, strength, purity
         and stability of the mixture.<P>

         <BR>
         
         Analytical standards are considered to be reference substances and are subject to

         <BR>
         
         Information developed by a supplier can be used to support characterization
         requirements, but the compliance statement for the overall study must state
         whether such data were developed under GLPS. Any data not developed under
         GLPS may be rejected by the Agency. Analyses must be performed to
         characterize the reference substance before it is used. In the case that a standard
         is used before it is analyzed, this is a violation of 40 CFR 160.105(a), which
         requires such determinations to be made before the standard is used in the study.<P>
         
<BR>         
<B><I>20. What documentation would apply to standards?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         Full characterization information as stated at 40 CFR 160.105 is required of
         standards. This section requires that any information that is appropriate for
         defining the standard, including identity, strength, purity, or composition, shall be
         determined for each batch before it is used. In the case of an analytical standard,
         for example, it is necessary to obtain analysis data documenting the identity,
         strength, and purity, for each batch. A labeled assay value, in and of itself, is
         insufficient.<P>

         field study?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         Yes, as provided at 40 CFR 160.105(c), storage containers for test substances shall
         be assigned for the duration of a study. This requirement is necessary to assure
         that test substances are stored in proper containers, and that the containers that
         are used can be accounted for during the study. At any time during the study, it
         must be possible to examine the containers to assure that this standard is met.
         However, requests for waivers involving large numbers of containers or safety
         concerns may be made to the Director, Policy and Grants Division (see question
         #23).<P>

         <BR>
         
         Yes, but only if written permission is obtained from the Director, Policy and
         Grants Division (see question # 23). The written letter authorizing disposal of
         containers will impose certain requirements that will ensure that the intent of the
         GLP standards are met.<P>

<B><I>23. How does one obtain such permission?</I></B><P>

         A request for permission must be submitted in writing to the Director, Policy and
         Grants Division, Office of Compliance Monitoring (EN-342), U.S. Environmental
         Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460. The request must
         identify the study for which permission is requested, the testing facility, the nature
         and quantity of containers involved, and the time and location(s) of the study.
         The request should also identify any special storage burdens or safety hazards
         which retention of the containers may pose.<P>

         <BR>
         
         EPA will request that sufficient documentation be available to assure that any
         containers which have been used for test substance storage during the course of a
         study are thoroughly accounted for from the time of receipt to disposal. This
         documentation would generally include such items as bills of lading, inventory
         records, receipts, use logs, and any other supportive records. In addition, the
         letter will stipulate that the Director of the Laboratory Data Integrity Assurance
         Division of OCM be notified of the location of such records in order that they be

<B><I>26. Can a "generic protocol  be used for obtaining sponsor approval?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         The GLPS require that the protocol be approved by the sponsor, and the date of
         approval must be included with the protocol; however the GLPS also provide
         flexibility in how this approval is obtained. A "generic protocol" approach may be
         acceptable for obtaining sponsor approval of certain protocol elements. In such a
         case, the testing facility which is drafting the protocol for a study would only need
         to obtain approval of those elements which were not included in the generic
         protocol. Please note that since the GLPS require protocols to include certain
         information that would not be included in a generic protocol, such as the test
         substance or the proposed start and termination dates, it would still be necessary
         to obtain sponsor approval for such information in addition to the approval of the

         protocol provisions given at 40 CFR 160.120(a)(6) and (7), as applicable.

         <BR>
         
         This requirement is intended to ensure that all information related to the study is
          included in the final report. Specifically, when individual scientists findings are
         part of the study effort, they are required to be included separately. Combined
         reports may in effect be consensus documents, and that would defeat the purpose
         of this requirement. Note that this requirement is not intended to require
         separate reports of all scientists participating in a study if such scientists are not,
         in fact, providing individual findings or opinions. For example, pathologist's
         reports are considered to be separate findings which must be reported separately.<P>

         after the end of the study to allow this to be done?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         Under GLPS, the study director is required to assure that all raw data,
         documentation, the protocol, specimens, and final reports are transferred to the
         archives during or at the close of the study (40 CFR 160.33(f)). Thus, there is no
         grace period. The study director must comply with this requirement prior to
         signing the compliance statement. This ensures that data are fully accounted for
         at the completion of the study.<P>

<BR>         
<B><I>30. How does EPA define "close of study" in regard to archiving?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         The term "at the close of the study" is strictly interpreted to mean that point of
         time at which the study director signs the final study report. The act of signing
         the final report is one of assurance by the study director that the report is a true
         representation of the data that support the report. At or prior to the time that
         the study report is signed, the study director must pass control of the raw data to
         the archives where their integrity will be maintained. Any delay in the transfer of
         data beyond the close of the study creates a lapse between the time that the study
         director assures that the raw data support the study report and the time that the
         data are secured from damage, misuse, or loss.<P>

         <BR>
         
         There is flexibility in the location of the archives of raw data and specimens. At
         40 CFR 160.190(b), the GLPS state that retention of records at alternate locations
         is acceptable, provided that there is specific reference to those locations in the
         archives. Such off-location archives must still meet the full requirements of 40
         CFR 160.190. Whether records are archived at the registrant's facility, at a
         contractor's central location, or at separate contractors' locations, the study
         director must assure that all raw data and specimens have been archived before
         the study report is signed. If the study director cannot assure that records at a
         particular location are archived correctly, he should not sign a compliance
         statement that indicates that this standard has been met. Note that, for the
         purpose of complying with GLPS, true copies may be archived at the close of the
         study. The original records will have to be maintained as well but need not be
         archived at the end of the study if this is impractical, for example where the
         original data constitutes a facility record shared by other studies still in progress at
         the close of the study.<P>

<B><I>32. Is it necessary to retain frozen tissue samples in archives, or may these be
         discarded after quality assurance verification?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         Under FIFRA GLPS, 40 CFR 160.195, frozen tissue samples are required to be
         retained in archives, and there are no specific allowances for their being discarded
         as there are for "specimens obtained from mutagenicity tests, specimens of soil,
         water, and plants, and wet specimens of blood, urine, feces, and biological fluids."
         The GLPS do not require specially prepared material to be retained beyond the
         period that it affords evaluation if such material is relatively fragile and differs
         markedly in stability or quality during storage. EPA does not believe that this is
         the case for many types of frozen tissues. The reason that tissues are frozen is to
         retain their utility for evaluation. Please note that, as provided at 40 CFR
         160.195(h), non-documentary material such as samples and specimens may be
         discarded after EPA has notified the sponsor or testing facility in writing that
         retention is no longer required.<P>

<B><I>33. Must field notebooks be archived during or at the close of a study?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         If a notebook contains raw data, the notebook or the raw data must be archived
         at the close of the study. Note that the registrant is responsible for the <U>original</U>
         records under 40 CFR 169.2(k) and section 8 of FIFRA, so it is inadvisable to

         <BR>
         
         Such preparations need not be retained beyond the period that they afford
         evaluation, as stated at 40 CFR 160.195(c). Generally, samples prepared for
         analysis have limited utility beyond the time of analysis and can be discarded.<P>

<B><I>35. How long must soil, water and plant specimens be retained?</I></B><P>

         jeopardize the integrity of the study, as provided at 40 CFR 160.190(a) and
         160.195(c). Please note that there may be study-specific sample retention
         requirements in addition to and independent of GLP requirements. Failure to

         Finally, it is unlawful under FIFRA section 12(a)(2)(B)(i) of FIFRA to refuse to

         Section 14(a) of FIFRA provides for maximum civil penalties of not more than
         $5000 per offense for violations of the Act by registrants, commercial applicators,
         wholesalers, dealers, retailers, or other distributors, and of not more than $1000
         per offense for other persons. For knowing violations of the Act, FIFRA section
         14(b) provides for maximum criminal penalties of not more than $50,000 and/or 1
         year imprisonment for producers, registrants, or applicants for registration and of
         not more than $25,000 and/or 1 year imprisonment for other knowing violators.<P>

<B><I>39. Will civil or criminal penalties be imposed for all GLP violations?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         No. Section 9(c)(3) of FIFRA allows a written notice of warning to be issued for
         a minor violation, if such warning is determined to be adequate to serve the public
         interest. Section 14(a)(4) of the Act further provides that in determining the size
         of a penalty EPA may issue a warning in the case that a violation occurred despite
         exercise of due caution or did not cause significant harm to health or the
         environment. Finally, section 14(a)(2) of FIFRA provides that persons other than
         registrants, commercial applicators, wholesalers, dealers, retailers or other
         distributors who violate any provision of the Act may be assessed a civil penalty
         only subsequent to receiving a written warning for a prior violation. Thus, persons
         who only perform testing and are not engaged in the distribution and sale of
         pesticides will not be assessed civil penalties for their first offense. This does not
         extend to criminal penalties as described at section 14(b)(2) of FIFRA.<P>
         
<BR>         
<B><I>40. Can EPA reject studies not conducted in accordance with GLPS?</I></B><P>
         <BR>
         
         Yes. The regulations specifically provide for this at 40 CFR 160.17(a), which
         states that "EPA may refuse to consider reliable ... any data from a study which
         [is] not conducted in accordance with [GLPS]." GLP violations associated with a
         study submitted to EPA may also result in enforcement actions whether or not a
         study is rejected.<P>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of November 20, 1991.  In that letter you described an
ongoing
oncogenicity study, sponsored by the ________.  As you have indicated, the study will require the
maintenance of a fairly large number of _____ cylinders.  The Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)
regulations (40 CFR &amp; 792.1 <u>et seq.</u>) require, among other things, that each storage
container for
a test, control, or reference substance be assigned to a particular substance for the duration of
the study (40 CFR section 792.105(c)).<p>

     EPA believes that the provision for the assignment of storage containers for the duration
of a
study is a logical and necessary provision of the GLP regulations.  In most cases this
requirement provides accountability of test material in a manner which poses no unusual burden. 
However, due to unstable and potentially hazardous nature of the substance in question
_________, this GLP requirement may present an unusual burden to the laboratory as well as a
potentially hazardous situation.<p>

     In granting previous exemptions to this provision of the GLP regulations, EPA has
established
stringent recordkeeping requirements as an alternate method of accounting for storage
containers in lieu of actual storage for the duration of the study.  For the purposes of exemption
from the assignment requirements for this study, EPA will require that the following
documentation be retained for the duration of the study: 1) purchase and shipping receipts for all
______ storage containers received at the laboratory (certified copies dated and signed by
responsible persons will be considered adequate); and 2) records of the final destination of the
storage containers such as receipts from the recycler or reclaimer (again, dated and signed
certified copies will be adequate).<p>

     Additionally, this exemption from the assignment requirements for the above study is
conditional
on the following:<p>

1)  for this study, a statement shall be included with the statement of compliance or
noncompliance required at 40 CFR section 792.12(b) explaining that this exception to the Good
Laboratory Practices regulations is in accordance with the requirements provided in this
letter;<p>

2)  an inventory shall be prepared for all empty containers before disposal, including sufficient
information to uniquely identify containers.  This inventory shall be maintained in an up-to-date
manner, recording all shipments of empty containers and their disposal.  This record shall be
maintained for the duration of the study;<p>

3)  identification of the locations of the facilities where test material is stored, where empty
containers are stored prior to disposal or recycling, where records of shipment of containers are
maintained, and where the test substance is used in the study (i.e. testing facility).  Within two
weeks of receipt of this letter, the location of each of these facilities shall be reported to:<p>

          David Dull, Director<p>

Laboratory Data Integrity Assurance Division <br>
Office of Compliance Monitoring (EN-342)<br>
Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances<br>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency<br>
401 M Street SW<br>          
Washington, DC 20460<p>

     Should these conditions not be fully met, the provisions of 40 CFR &amp; 8792.105(c)
shall apply.<p>

     In addition, the _________ is reminded that storage, disposal or recycling of containers
must be
done in a manner pursuant to all applicable Federal, State, County or local laws.<p>

Keywords: Archives, Final Report Signatures, Study Director Responsibilities<p>

<hr>
</b><p>

Dear<p>

     This is in reply to your letter of June 5, 1991 in which you requested clarification on
several
issues involving the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  Your questions were related to archiving requirements,
test and reference substance characterization testing, and the separation of GLP work from non
GLP work in a testing facility.<p>

     Your first question was in reference to the archiving requirements for final reports and
protocols
at the end of a study.  You cited two of the EPA's responses (numbers 12 and 28) in the Draft
Question and Answer document distributed on December 5, 1990, and two additional responses
to direct inquiries which have been released as "advisory" documents (numbers 9 and 12).  You
are concerned with the EPA statements regarding the timing of the transfer of material to
archives.  EPA had stated that the archiving, which is required at 40 CFR 160.33 to be
accomplished "during or at the close of the study", must be done before the compliance
statement and the final report are signed.  Your specific concern was that this appeared to cause
problems since the signed documents (i.e., the compliance statement and the final report) are
among the items that are required to be archived, and they must be archived after they are
signed.  Thus, it does not seem possible to complete all archiving before the compliance
statement and study report are signed.  Tangentially, you asked whether the requirement that "all
... protocols, ... and final reports" for a study be archived was inconsistent with the regulations
since there should be only one protocol and final report for a study.<p>

     You are correct in assuming that a copy of the signed study report including the signed
compliance statement are among the materials that must be archived during or at the close of
the study.  EPA agrees that such archiving is technically unfeasible until after these documents
have been signed.  Consequently, the requirement at 40 CFR 160.33 that archiving occur "during
or at the close" of the study must be interpreted as requiring that copies of the compliance
statement and study report must be archived immediately upon being signed by the study
director.  There is no substantial difference between the order in which these documents are
signed; the study director is accountable for the truth and accuracy of these documents in any
case.  There is also no inconsistency with the compliance statement being included in the final
report for submission to the EPA.<p>

     In reply to your query about the pluralization of the terms "protocol" and "final report" in
regards to
the archiving needs for a study (i.e., at 40 CFR 160.33 and 160.190), you are correct in noting
that having more than one protocol and study report would be inconsistent with the GLPS. 
However, the issue dealt with in question number 28 was the retention of documents, which is
specifically addressed at 40 CFR 160.190(a).  The language from that section, which includes
pluralization of the terms "protocol" and "report" even though the reference is to a single study,
was copied directly into the Question and Answer document.  In the regulation, the pluralization
of these terms assures that all protocols and reports from numerous studies, as well as
amendments and interim reports for any given study, must be kept.  This is admittedly confusing
in the limited context of the question which you cited, and we therefore intend to change these
terms to the singular tense in the final draft of the Question and Answer document.<p>

<p>

Your second question referred to 40 CFR 160.105 which requires test, reference and control
substances to be adequately characterized before use in a study.  Your specific concern was
whether there were problems when characterization has been done as a part of a different study,
i.e., to meet the data requirements for registration as stated at 40 CFR Part 258.  You felt that a
person citing such a characterization study in order to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 160.105
would not be able to assure GLP compliance since the characterization was performed by
somebody else.<p>

     You may be confusing the characterization study requirements of 40 CFR Part 158 with
the GLP
characterization requirements at 40 CFR 160.105.  These are not identical.  The data
requirements under 40 CFR 160.105 fulfil an entirely different purpose from the chemical
characterization requirements under 40 CFR Part 158.  The GLP characterization requirements
are batch-specific, and deal with the specific material used in the study.  They also include data
on control and reference as well as on the test substance, and require only that information
stated at &amp;160.105.  The Part 158 requirements are general to the product and do not supply
appropriately detailed information for characterizing that test substance which is used in a
specific study.<p>

     In your third question you asked for comment on the situation where a facility performs
both GLP
and non-GLP studies.  You suggested that such a facility might have standard operating
procedures in place which are active only during GLP studies.  For example, the standard
operating procedures (SOPs) might state that they are only active during GLP studies.<p>

     There is no problem with having both GLP and non-GLP studies performed at the same
facility
as long as there is no interference with the performance of the studies required to be under
GLPS.  For example, when facilities are shared between different studies, this may affect the
availability of personnel or facility resources.  Section 160.29(c) states that "there shall be a
sufficient number of personnel..." and section 160.41 states that "each testing facility shall be of
suitable size..." and "...shall be designed so that there is a degree of separation that will prevent
any function or activity from having an adverse effect on the study."  In order to document that
these sections were complied with, it would be necessary to document non-GLP activities that
GLP personnel are also engaged in, and it would be necessary to document that non-GLP
research does not interfere with available space for GLP studies or interfere with test system,
e.g., quarantine, requirements.  It is also necessary to assure that equipment "...be of
appropriate design and adequate capacity..." (40 CFR 160.61) and "...be
adequately...maintained...tested, calibrated and/or standardized..." (40 CFR 160.63).  This
means that non-GLP work performed on equipment used for GLP studies must be documented
to indicate that the equipment's capacity is not exceeded and to assure that maintenance and
calibration requirements are met.  (It may be necessary to perform certain maintenance or
calibration procedures after so many hours of operation, number of analyses, etc.)<p>

     If SOPs include a statement indicating that such SOPs need only be followed in the case
that a
study is under GLPS, this would cause problems if there were inadequate procedures to
differentiate (i.e., at the technician level) GLP studies from non-GLP studies.  If a study were
incorrectly identified as non-GLP during the execution of a particular procedure, it would result in
non-compliance.  There should be no problems if there are procedures in place to clearly indicate
at all times when a study is under GLPS.<p>

     If you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my
staff at
(703) 308-8290.<p>

<p>

Dear:<p>

This is in response to your letter of January 31, 1991, in which you described your company's
approach to performing pesticide field residue studies in support of marketing permits under the
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).<p>

You described this approach as incorporating all phases of experimental work from field
application to final reporting as a single study.  You further stated that it is your company's policy
to treat separate field trials of the same crop and product as separate studies when different
sites are involved.  In your program, each trial is regarded as a full study requiring compliance
with all study-specific requirements of the FIFRA Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS),
including having a single study director, a separate protocol, and meeting quality assurance unit
(QAU) inspectional requirements.  You mentioned that the application phase and analytical
phase of a study are considered part of the same study.<p>

The approach that you described does not conflict with the requirements of the GLPS, since the
residue results of a single location can be considered to demonstrate properties of the pesticide
independently of trial performed at other locations.  Thus the single location trial is definable
under 40 CFR 160.3 as a study.  Your described approach of assuring that all aspects of each
trial are considered together for that trial is essential since the separate parts of a study no not in
themselves demonstrate any properties of the test substance and hence cannot be defined as
studies under GLPS.  In separately treating each trial as a study you are correct in assigning
each trial its own protocol and study directory and assuring that each trial (i.e., study) meets QAU
inspection requirements separately.<p>

Please note that the approach that you describe is not the only method available to meet GLPS. 
There is latitude to combine trials performed at several locations into a single study protocol. 
The choice is purely one of administrative discretion on the part of the persons responsible for
the study. Regardless of how many field sites are involved in a study, however, analytical work
must remain part of the same study, and only one study director can be assigned.  Thus if a
person opted to include several field trials in one study only one study director could be assigned
to oversee all sites.<p>

Again, the approach that you described does not appear to conflict with GLP compliance.  If you
have any questions regarding this response, please contact Steve Howie of my staff at (703)
308-8290.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in reply to your letter of March 2, 1992 to Dr. David Dull of the Laboratory Data
Integrity
Assurance Division.  Your letter was referred to my office for response.<p>

     You requested information regarding compliance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,
and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  Specifically, you
requested information regarding acceptable practices for archiving of raw data under GLPS and
the circumstances under which copies can be used.<p>

     Your practices include recording data from several studies in one bound notebook.  At the
completion of each study you photocopy and stamp as true copies the data for that study and
transfer the copies to archives.  You then continue to use the notebook for additional studies until
it is full, at which point it too is archived.<p>

     You asked whether these practices comply with GLPS, since you had heard that copies
can only
be used to replace data on non-permanent media such as decomposing or light sensitive paper,
or to provide back-ups for audit purposes.  You had also heard that the GLP archiving
requirements referred to original data, and that photocopies could not be used to meet the need
to archive data at or before the completion of each study.<p>

     At 40 CFR 160.3 the GLPS provide that "In the event that exact transcripts of raw data
have
been prepared...the exact copy...may be substituted for the original source as raw data." 
Further, the GLPS provide, at 40 CFR 160.195(i) [Retention of records], that "Records required
by this part may be retained either as original records or as true copies such as photocopies,
microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions of the original records."<p>

     Clearly, there are provisions within the GLPS for the substitution of true copies for
original
records.  These provisions allow for the use of such copies to meet GLP archiving requirements. 
Thus, archiving of "true copies" complies with GLPS as long as the true copies are placed in
archives before or immediately at the time the study report is signed by the study director.<p>

     However, the "true copy" provisions under GLPS are limited entirely to GLP compliance
and do
not extend to regulatory requirements elsewhere in FIFRA.  Specifically, the FIFRA section 8
(book and records) regulations at 40 CFR 169.2(k) require retention of all raw data, such as
original laboratory notebooks.  These requirements are met by your procedures of archiving the
original laboratory notebooks (from which true copies have been archived for GLP purposes)
after the completion of several studies per notebook.<p>

     In summary, the procedures which you described appear to be adequate to meet the
separate
requirements of GLPS and FIFRA section 8.  If you have any questions concerning this
response, please contact Steve Howie of my staff at (703) 308-8290.<p>

</b><p>

Dear Mr.<p>

     This is in reply to your letter of October 7, 1991, to Mr. Steve Howie of my staff.  In your
letter you
requested clarification regarding whether a treated seed would be considered the "test
substance" when a field residue trial is being conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory
Practice Standards (GLPS) with such seed.  You stated that you have regarded treated seed as
an "extension of the test substance" and have required chain of custody, secure storage, and
receipt, use and disposition logs.  I am presuming that your request for clarification was in
reference to required testing under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA).<p>

     Under FIFRA GLPS, at 40 CFR 160.3, the term "test substance" is defined as:<p>

          "...a substance or mixture administered or added to a test system in a study, which
substance or
mixture:<p>

               (1)  Is the subject of an application for a research or marketing permit
supported by the study, or
is the contemplated subject of such an application; or<p>

               (2)  Is an ingredient, impurity, degradation product, metabolite, or
radioactive isotope of a
substance described by paragraph (1) of this definition, or some other substance related to a
substance described by that paragraph, which is used in the study to assist in characterizing the
toxicity, metabolism, or other characteristics of a substance described by that paragraph."<p>

     According to this definition, treated seeds would be considered test substances under
FIFRA
GLPS only if the treated seeds themselves are the subject of or intended to be the subject of a
research or marketing application (i.e., a pesticide registration).  Thus, it is the pesticide which is
used to treat the seed which would normally be considered to be the test substance under GLPS. 
Test substance requirements, such as retention of containers, would therefore not apply to
seeds.  While the control measures that you identified, i.e., chain of custody, secure storage,
receipt, use, and distribution logs, are not actually required of the treated seeds, their
implementation will not conflict with the requirements of GLPS and may very well contribute to
the overall integrity of the study.<p>

     Seeds which are not considered to be the test substance would still be considered part of
the
test system as defined in the FIFRA GLPS.  The seeds would thus be subject to all GLP
standards applicable to test systems.<p>

     Please note, finally, that if a seed product should become or it is intended to become the
subject
of a research or marketing permit under FIFRA, the seed would then be the test substance as
defined under the FIFRA GLPS.  In that case, the seed would be subject to the GLP
requirements that apply to test substances instead of those that apply to test systems.<p>

     If you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my
staff at
(703) 308-8290.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of March 3, 1992 in which you requested clarification of
certain
issues covered by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory
Practice Standards (GLPS).  You requested clarification regarding the definition of a testing
facility as
described at 40 CFR 160.3 and the responsibilities of the testing facility management as described
at
40 CFR 160.31.<p>

     You stated that your company oversees a number of field trials which involve a number of
independent contractors in different locations around the country.  Your company coordinates
between subcontractors and the sponsor.  The tasks performed by individual contractors is limited
to
cover application of test substances, sample collection, and sample shipment.  Separate analytical
laboratories are responsible for analyzing samples.  Each contractor employs a principal
investigator
who reports to the Study Director, who is usually an employee of your company designated by
your
management.<p>

     There were several questions which you asked in relation to the above scenario.  These
questions
concerned determination of who is the "testing facility" and who is "testing facility management"
when
actual use of the test substance in the test system is by field cooperators, while facility
management
responsibilities as defined at 40 CFR 160.31 are assumed by your company and/or by the study
sponsor.  You asked: (1) whether actual conduct of the study at the field cooperators is consistent
with "testing facility management" being at your company; (2) if management duties at 40 CFR
160.31
could be performed in part by the sponsor (such as designating the study director) and in part by
your
company; (3) whether the "testing facility" is only the field cooperator when management duties
are
carried out elsewhere; (4) how can management duties at 40 CFR 160.31 be performed in the
case of
field cooperators being "testing facilities"; (5) whether all field cooperators are "testing facilities"
or
whether your company should be defined as the testing facility; and (6) whether it is necessary for
copies of the final report to be maintained by each field cooperator.<p>

     These questions are largely answered by understanding that there is only one "testing
facility" for any
given study regardless of how many organizational subunits, i.e., subcontractors, are involved in
its
performance.  Hence, if a study's performance involves you company and several subcontractors,
all
of the portions of the different organizations which perform study activities are considered
together to
be the testing facility.  The address of the testing facility in such a situation is assumed to be the
address where testing facility management and overall study coordination is located.  Note that
since
there is only one "testing facility" it is not necessary for each subcontractor involved in a study to
retain a copy of the final report.<p>

     "Testing facility management" consists simply of the organizational entity or subunit(s)
which provides
the assurances required at 40 CFR 160.31.  It is not at all inconsistent for testing facility
management
responsibilities to be centralized at your company while technical performance is conducted by a
number of field cooperators.  Note, however, that the GLPS clearly state that certain tasks such
as
designation of the director are responsibilities of the testing facility management.  Therefore the
sponsor could designate the study director only if acting in the role of testing facility
management.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of February 11, 1992, to Dr. David Dull, which was
referred to
my office for reply.  In your letter you requested clarification on self-carbonized paper and
whether carbonized copies (i.e., second and third copies on carbonized paper) would suffice for
the raw data.  The letter stated that the carbonized pages are "exact", and stamped as such.<p>

     Under 40 CFR 160.195(i), exact copies, which could be carbon copies, can be used to
meet
certain Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) data archiving requirements.  For example, such exact
copies may suffice for audit purposes, or for meeting data archiving time constraints.  However,
original records (top original) must be kept to meet the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act section 8 books and records requirements as stated at 40 CFR 169.2(k).  These
regulations require the producer/sponsor to maintain <u>all</u> underlying raw data, which
means that
originals must be kept.<p>

referred
to the requirements for studies performed in accordance with Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  You specifically

     The requirements for the QAU are clearly stated at 40 CFR 160.35.  As this section states,
there
are a number of specific duties that the QAU must perform, and the QAU must be entirely

Dear<p>

     This is in reply to your letter of April 7, 1992 in which you requested clarification
regarding certain
studies being performed by __________ currently and in the near future.  Your questions had to
do with drafting protocols and reporting study results when there are two different active
ingredients which are co-applied in field dissipation studies.<p>

     Specifically, you stated that _____ was contracted by two task forces, the _____ and the
_____
task Force II to conduct field dissipation and plant residue trials for the active ingredients _____
and _____.  At the request of your clients the two actives were applied as a single formulation,
but the two task forces have each requested that the other task force not receive its data.  You
stated that you believed that since the two actives were co-applied for each trial under a single
protocol, that a single study report should be written to encompass the results concerning both
actives.  However, the meet your clients needs, it would not be acceptable to submit a single
report covering both actives to each of your clients.<p>

     You proposed separating the data to protect the sensitive information for each active, i.e.,
the
analytical data for each active, from disclosure to the client concerned with the other active
ingredient.  To enable you to do this, your clients agreed to a reporting format involving three
volumes: Volume 1 would involve field data results common to both studies; Volume 2 would
involve analytical data results resources involving _____ and Volume 3 would involve analytical
data results involving _____.  EPA would receive all three volumes while the _____ would
receive Volumes 1 and 3 and the _____ Task Force II would receive Volumes 1 and 2.  As
described in your letter, all of the work involving both active ingredients (combined for
application
in a single formulation) would be considered a single study and would be submitted to EPA as
such.<p>

     You clarified several points in a discussion with Steve Howie, of my staff on May 5, 1992. 
In that
conversation you stated that this format would be used initially for the field dissipation trial and
repeated separately (i.e., three additional volumes) for the plant residue trial.  You also stated
that it was the intent of the  _____ and the _____ to be represented by a single sponsor in
supporting each study concerning both actives.  You also stated that it was your understanding
that the co-application of these actives with the subsequent reporting of results concerning both
actives in combined study reports (i.e., one field dissipation study and report for both actives, and
one plant residue study and report for both actives) was the technical approach preferred by the
EPA program office which would be reviewing the data.<p>

     The two potential areas of conflict between the GLP regulations and your plan for study
administration lie in (1) definition of work involving two actives as a single study under the
definition provided in the GLP regulations and (2) assuring that study sponsor responsibilities are
properly executed.  Our office has reviewed your plan and, contingent on your meeting those two
concerns, sees no conflict with performing this study in full compliance with GLPS.<p>

<p>

     The plan for including experimental work involving two actives within a single study
appears to be
sound in this case since the two actives (one is a synergist for the other) are normally marketed
for co-application, and data regarding their characteristics when they are co-applied are needed
for Agency decision making.  The alternative of drafting separate study documentation in order to
identify a separate "study" for each active would be unnecessarily duplicative.  Hence, the
performance of this work under a single study protocol for each experiment covering both actives
(one protocol for the combined field dissipation test and one protocol for the combined plant
residue test) is acceptable.<p>

     The plan of identifying a single sponsor with overall responsibility for the study would be
in
accordance with the GLPS provided that this person complies with the definition of sponsor as
provided at 40 CFR 160.3, i.e., such person "(1)...initiates or supports [the study], by provision of
financial or other resources; (2) ...submits [the] study to EPA in support of an application for a
research or marketing permit; or (3) [is the] testing facility, if it both initiates and actually
conducts
the study."  Also, this person must perform <u>all</u> sponsor related activities under GLPS
including
approving the protocol (40 CFR 160.120(a)(14) 0, signing the study compliance statement (40
CFR 160.12), and maintaining a copy of the final report (40 CFR 160.185(d) ).<p>

Dear<p>

This is in reply to your letter of April 13, 1992.  In that letter you requested clarification regarding
the requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).<p>

You were specifically interested in the sample retention requirements for certain test substances
used in studies performed under GLPS.  The test substances in question are various fungal and
bacterial cultures which, according to your letter, are relatively fragile.  You asked whether it
would be permissible to dispose of such samples after quality assurance verification as provided
at 40 CFR 160.195(c), or whether it would instead be necessary to first obtain notification from
EPA as provided at 40 CFR 160.195(h).<p>

The provisions of 40 CFR 160.195(c) apply to those types of non-documentary materials which
the EPA believes can be disposed of without significant harm to the integrity of the study.  As
stated in this subsection, certain materials (i.e., wet specimens, samples of test substances, etc.,
which are relatively fragile and differ markedly in stability and quality during storage) need to be
retained only as long as the quality of the preparation affords evaluation.  Other materials (i.e.,
specimens obtained from mutagenicity tests, etc.) may be disposed of at any time after quality
assurance verification.<p>

The provisions of 40 CFR 160.195(h) are intended to provide a means for disposal of certain
materials which are not covered by 40 CFR 160.195(c).  Thus, materials which are covered by
the provisions of 40 CFR 160.195(c) do not need to meet the Agency notification provisions of
40
CFR 160.195(h) before they are discarded.<p>

The bacterial and fungal culture material that you describe may be of a nature that would allow
disposal under the provisions of 40 CFR 160.195(c).  For this to be the case it is necessary to
document that the material is relatively fragile and otherwise does not afford evaluation.  Without
such documentation the provisions of 40 CFR 160.195(h) requiring EPA notification would
apply. 
Assuming that such documentation exists, and that quality assurance verification is obtained
prior to sample disposal, there is no need for EPA notification prior to disposal.<p>

In the case that materials are discarded under the provisions of either 40 CFR 160.195(c) or (h),
documentation relevant to the disposal of such samples must be retained for the duration of time
applicable to sample retention at 40 CFR 160.195(b).  Such records must identify the discarded
material and provide the required support for any decisions regarding sample disposal.  Finally,
please note that all other applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing waste
disposal must be complied with when any materials are discarded.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of July 29, 1992 in which you requested relief from
certain
requirements under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  Specifically, you requested relief from the requirement
under these standards for the retention of tests substance storage containers for the duration of
a study, as provided at 40 CFR 160.105(c).<p>

     Your request was restricted to your study number ____             Banana Fruit Magnitude
of
residue study.  You described this study as involving ____       liquid formulation, batch number
____ .  It is to involve six sites in five foreign countries:  Guatemala (1035 liters); Honduras
(1035
liters); Costa Rica, site 1 (1295 liters); Costa Rica, site 2 (1295 liters); Panama (1550 liters); and
Colombia (1035 liters).  The test substance is packaged in 10 liter containers, 2 per box.<p>

     You stated that long-term retention of containers would represent a safety hazard that
may
conflict with the regulations in the countries involved in the study.<p>

     Our staff has reviewed your request in light of the need to provide complete accountability
of test
material and the potential burden involved in storing and accounting for over 700 containers in
six different locations in five countries.  It is our opinion that certain recordkeeping steps could
provide a basis for establishing an acceptable alternate method for the accounting of test
substance storage containers in lieu of actual storage of the containers for the duration of this
study, and are willing to allow a conditional exception to this requirement.<p>

     This exception is applicable to the study that you cited in your letter, and is conditional on
the
following:<p>

1) ______  shall assure the following records are maintained as raw data for this study: (a)
information of shipments pertaining to each container leaving the storage sites (examples of
such records are shipping request records, bills of lading, carrier bills, and monthly inventories of
warehouse activity); (b) test article receipt records at each testing facility; (c) complete use logs
of material taken from containers; (d) a record of the final destination of the container, including
the place and date of disposal or reclaiming, and any appropriate receipts.<p>

2)  A statement shall be included with the statement of compliance or noncompliance required at
40 CFR 160.12 describing that this exception to Good Laboratory Practices is in accordance with
the conditions provided in this letter.<p>

3) _______ shall prepare an inventory of empty containers before disposal, including sufficient
information to uniquely identify containers, and shall maintain this inventory in an up-to-date
manner recording all arrivals of empty containers and their disposal.  This record shall be
maintained as raw data for this study.<p>

4) ________ shall identify the locations of facilities: where test material is stored; where empty
containers are stored prior to disposal; where records of use, shipment, and disposal of
containers are maintained; and where the test substance is used in studies (i.e., testing facility). 
Within two weeks of receipt of notification of any pending inspection involving this study,  
__________ shall report the location of each of these facilities to:<p>

Pesticides and Toxic Substances<p>

TO:       David L. Dull, Director <br>
      Laboratory Data Integrity Assurance Division<p>

     My office has received your August 24, 1992 memorandum in which you request a legal
opinion
as to the appropriate functions of the Quality Assurance Unit under the God Laboratory Practice
regulations at 40 CFR 160.35.  Specifically, you asked whether any of the activities of study
director, quality assurance unit and testing facility management can be conducted by the same
person.<p>

     40 CFR 160.35(a) sets forth that, "[f]or any given study, the quality assurance unit shall be
entirely separate from and independent of the personnel engaged in the direction and conduct of
that study."  The regulations do not place a similar restriction upon the roles of testing facility
management nor study director.<p>

     It is our position that the regulation allows the study director and/or the testing facility
management to have more than one role.  For example, a study director who is also the
president of the company is not in violation of the regulation.  However, we feel that the
regulation prohibits the personnel assigned to the quality assurance unit from performing any
other function at the testing facility which may impact a study.  Therefore, members of the quality
assurance unit cannot work on any aspect of a study, even in an advisory capacity; cannot be a
study director; cannot be part of testing facility management.<p>

     In your memorandum you raise a question concerning the compliance status of a testing
facility
where the quality assurance employee is married to the study director or the president of the
company.  You are justified in suspecting a possible violation of 40 CFR 160.35(a).  This
situation, however, is not a violation of the regulation per se.  The regulation only requires the
quality assurance unit to maintain independence and separateness for <u>any given study</u>. 
Therefore, the inspector should try to document the steps taken by the testing facility to insure
compliance with the quality assurance unit requirement of independence and separateness.  For
example, request a copy of an SOP which states that Husband cannot perform quality assurance
functions for any given study conducted by Wife.  Then follow-up this SO by requesting
documentation as to the employees who worked on any given study to make sure that they are
adhering to the SOP.<p>

     If you have any further questions concerning the proper roles of the quality assurance unit,
study
director or testing facility management do not hesitate to contact Helene Ambrosino of my staff at
(202) 260-0239.<p>

Dear<p>

This is in response to your letter of September 3, 1992 in which you asked for clarification
regarding the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory
Practice Standards (GLPS).  Specifically, you wished to know if the requirement that the final
report be signed and dated by the study director (40 CFR 160.185(b)) means that the study
director's signature must be personally dated.  You asked whether this standard could instead be
met by including a printed date on the cover page of the study final report.<p>

Since the GLPS do not explicitly state how the report be dated, mechanical means of dating are
acceptable.  This could include, as you suggested, a dated cover page for the study final report,
provided that is the date that the study director actually signed the report.  Please note that the
date that the study director signs the full report is defined in the regulations as the study
completion date (40 CFR 160.3).  If the cover page date is not the date the report was signed,
and the signature itself is not dated, this would be a violation of the GLPS.<p>

Therefore, you are advised that, while various means of dating the final report may be used,
problems arise if the actual date that the study director signs the report is not indicated.  It would
appear that the simplest way to assure compliance with this provision would be for the study
director to personally date his or her signature.  If you have any questions concerning this
response, please contact Steve Howie of my staff at (703) 308-8290.<p>

This is in reply to your letter of July 24, 1992, in which you requested clarification regarding the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice
Standards
(GLPS) requirements.  Specifically, you wrote to ask whether archiving requirements apply to
analytical standards used in GLPS.  If so, you wanted to know whether a single aliquot of the
pure material or, alternatively, whether an aliquot of each preparation would need to be kept. 
Your question was prompted by question number 18 of the May 12, 1992 FIFRA GLP Questions
and Answers (Q&amp;A) document which stated that analytical standards are considered to be
reference materials under GLPS.<p>

As stated in the May 12 Q&amp;A document, analytical standards are considered to be reference
substances.  As such, all GLP standards that apply to reference substances apply to the
analytical standards.  Therefore, as stated at 40 CFR 160.105(d), if a study is of greater than four
weeks experimental duration, a reserve sample must be maintained for the duration of time
provided at 40 CFR 160.195.<p>

This requirement applies to the pure analytical standard that is used in the study.  If more than
one batch of standard is used, a reserve sample of each batch must be kept.  A single reserve
sample (of each batch) would ordinarily be adequate.  It is not necessary to keep samples of
preparations made using the standard.<p>

Dear<p>

This is in reply to your letter of August 3, 1992, in which you requested clarification concerning
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice
Standards (GLPS).  In your letter you raised three questions related to test, control, and
reference substance characterization requirements.  Your Questions are presented and
responded to separately below.<p>

1.  Samples of the dosage forms, administered to animals on GLP studies, are sent to analytical
laboratories for determination of concentration and uniformity as required at 40 CFR 160.113(a)
(1).  Must these analyses be conducted under <u>full</u> GLP compliance (i.e., 40 CFR
160.135(a)) or
under <u>limited</u> GLP compliance (i.e., 40 CFR 160.135(b))?<p>

When mixtures of test substances in carriers must be analyzed in order to meet the requirements
of 40 CFR 160.113(a) (1), such analyses must be preformed under GLPS.  However, this is
because these analyses are being performed as part of a greater study which is under GLPS. 
The analyses themselves are not "studies" and hence the distinctions provided at 40 CFR
160.135 for physical and chemical characterization studies do not apply.<p>

Since the analysis is part of a larger study, all of the GLP requirements relevant to that study
apply to the analytical work.  However, where those requirements are compiled with by the
"greater study" it may not be necessary to duplicate compliance in detail for each analysis.<p>

2.  On occasion, a large container (10 kg or more) of a particular compound is received in an
individual container.  For ease of handling, the bulk compound is transferred to smaller
containers.  Compound is then taken from these containers (designated one container at a time)
to supply "working bottles" for individual studies.  Must all of these "storage" containers be
retained for the duration of the study <u>or</u> is it only necessary to retain the "working
bottles" which
are assigned to individual studies?<p>

The regulations at 40 CFR 160.105(c) state that "storage containers shall be assigned to a
particular test substance for the duration of the study."  This requirement refers to all which is
used in the study.  If an adequate, smaller test substance storage container is assigned before
the study commences, and that container is where all of the test substance used in the study is
stored throughout the study, the container retention requirements would apply to that container. 
It would be necessary to retain this container throughout the study but it would not be necessary
to keep larger bulk containers from which material was transferred before the study began.<p>

Note that if a larger container is used to refill the smaller container during the study, that larger
container would be considered to be a test substance storage container for that study. Similarly,
if test substance is drawn from the smaller container for use in additional studies, the smaller
container would be required to meet retention requirements for all such studies (i.e., it must be
retained until the last study is completed.) The requirements at 40 CFR 160.105(c) are not
intended to apply to "working bottles" which are used only for direct use in the study.  However,
if
such "working bottles" are in fact used for test substance storage they must comply with the
requirements at 40 CFR 160.105(c).  If there is any doubt concerning the status of such working
bottles, presume that compliance is required.  Note that this would not preclude refilling working
bottles during the study from the preliminary storage container.<p>

3.  Must the analytical methods used to determine stability, concentration, and uniformity of
mixtures <u>or</u> to characterize test, control, or reference substances be validated?<p>

The GLPS require that certain analyses be performed for characterizing test, control, and
reference substances and for characterizing mixtures.  To the extent that such analyses must be
required under a particular study, they must comply with all relevant GLP standards. While
"method validation" is not a specific regulatory requirement under the GLPS, if there is
insufficient documentation to support study characterization requirements, including inadequate
documentation supporting the validity of the methods used, the characterization data may be
considered invalid or incomplete.<p>

Dear<p>

This is in response to your letter of September 17, 1992, in which you requested an exemption
for the TSCA Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) requirement at 40 CFR 792.105(c) for a
two-year
inhalation study with hydrochlorofluorocarbon HCFC-124.  In that letter you explained that due
to
the large quantity of test material (73,000 kg), and the large size and high cost of the four ISO
containers to be used, the laboratory would incur a substantial financial burden if required to
assign each container to the test substance for the duration of the study.  Instead, you plan to
recycle the containers during the course of the study to reduce storage costs, that is, the test
facility would have two containers on-site, a supply container of test material, and a recovery
container of spent material which when full would be returned to the material supplier for
recycling.  The empty supply container would then serve as the replacement recovery container,
and a recycled supply container would be shipped to the facility from the supplier.  Based on this
description, EPA assumes that the 4 ISO containers would be dedicated to this study, and that
no material other than HCFC-124 or the material recovered from its use would be stored in the
containers.<p>

You have proposed to keep the following documentation with the study records to track the
movement of the ISO containers:<p>

(1)  Receipt documents of each ISO container including the bill of lading and carrier bill.<p>

(2)  Test material tracking form.<p>

(3)  Shipping documents for return of each ISO container to the supplier, including the shipping
request, bill of lading, and carrier bill.<p>

The assignment requirement at 792.105(c)m is important and normally poses no significant
burden.  However, given the cost information provided in your letter, and the large volume of
material you plan to use, we believe that an exemption is warranted in your case.  In granting
previous exemptions, EPA has established stringent recordkeeping requirements as an alternate
method of assigning storage containers in lieu of compliance with 792.105(c).  In addition to the 
documentation you have proposed to maintain in your study records, this exemption from the
requirements for the subject study is conditional on the following:<p>

(1)  The receipt documents for the ISO containers shall be signed and dated by the responsible
parties;<p>

(2)  Retain signed and dated records of the origin and final destination of the ISO containers,
such as receipts from the supplier, recycler, or reclaimer;<p>

(3)  For this study, include a statement under 40 CFR 792.12(b) explaining that this exception to
the regulations is in accordance with the conditions of this letter;<p>

(4)  Within two weeks of receipt of this letter, report to the following person the identity and
locations of (1) the facilities storing the test material, (2) the facility storing empty containers
prior
to recycling or return to the supplier, and the recycling or supplier's facility, (3) the facility
maintaining the records of shipment, and (4) the test facility using the substance in the study:<p>

Keywords: Raw Data retention from superceded studies, cancelled studies<p>

<hr>
</b><p>

Dear<p>

This letter is in reply to a question that you asked at the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS) Conference which our
office held in Arlington, Virginia on September 9 and 10 of this year.  Your question dealt with
the
issue of raw data retention requirements under section 8 of FIFRA.<p>

Specifically, you wanted to know whether underlying raw data for a study is required to be
maintained after the performance of a new study which supersedes it.  This situation could arise
if new research is performed to determine a pesticide active ingredient's effects.  In the case that
the old study's results are no longer used in Agency decision making, you wanted to know
whether it is still necessary to retain the raw data which support that study.<p>

As stated at 40 CFR 169.2(k), in the regulation titled "books and Records for Pesticide Producers
and Distributors", pesticide procedures are required to maintain records of all underlying raw data
from research relating to registered pesticides.  This requirement is not limited to data which are
actively being used for regulatory decision making, and, hence, does apply to studies which have
been superseded.  Such research may still contain valuable information, and discarding the
underlying raw data would compromise the integrity of the research findings.  Hence, underlying
raw data for older, superseded studies must still be maintained.<p>

The FIFRA section 8 regulations state that these records, as with any other research data, must
be maintained for as long as the pesticide is registered and the producer is in business.  It is
unlawful for the producer to discard raw data-related to a registered pesticide within this time
period.<p>

Please note that GLPS may require data retention for periods of time exceeding the period of
time stated at 40 CFR 169.2(k).  In order to comply with the GLP data retention requirements at
40 CFR 160.195(b), raw data must be retained for whichever period of time is longest: (1) the
period during which the sponsor holds the research or marketing permit (i.e., registration) to
which the study is pertinent; (2) five years following the date the data are submitted to EPA; or
(3) in cases where the data re not submitted, 2 years following the date the study was
completed, discontinued, or terminated.  As with data retention requirements stated at 40 CFR
160.2(k), these requirements are not affected by the performance of additional studies.<p>

If you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my staff at
(703) 308-8290.<p>

<p>

Dear:<p>

This is in reply to your request for clarification regarding the responsibilities of the Interregional
Research Project No. 4 (IR-4) and pesticide registrants for data development by IR-4 in support
of minor uses.  You specifically wanted to know whether responsibility for compliance with the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice
Standards
(GLPS) applied to the pesticide registrants when IR-4 was sponsoring tests and submitting the
final reports to EPA.<p>

As you are aware, any study intended to be submitted in support of an application for a pesticide
research or marketing permit must be conducted in accordance with FIFRA GLPS.  Among other
things, this includes studies in support of tolerance petitions under section 408 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  When any such study is submitted, it must be accompanied by a
true and accurate statement of compliance or noncompliance of the type described at 40 CFR
160.12 signed by the study director, the study sponsor and the applicant.<p>

If the IR-4 sponsors a study and submits the data to the Agency for the purposes of registration
of minor uses or obtaining a related tolerance, the IR-4 assumes responsibility for assuring the
compliance status of the study and an authorized representative of the IR-4 must sign the
statement of compliance or noncompliance.  The study director, who may also be with IR-4, must
also sign this statement.  It is permissible for one individual to fill both of these functions as long
as he or she is clearly identified as such on the statement.<p>

When IR-4 acts as a testing facility and/or sponsor, it is responsible for compliance with GLPS
including the provisions for retention of records at 40 CFR 160.195.<p>

In addition to these requirements, when data are submitted in support of the registration of a
particular product, for example, in response to a data call in under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B), the
registrant/producer is responsible for maintaining the supporting raw data records pursuant to
FIFRA section 8 and the related regulations at 40 CFR 169.2(k).  Please note that producers are
not required to physically possess such records as long as the location of the records is known,
and they can make available the records when requested.  Therefore, as long as such records
remain accessible and producers can make them available, they may be maintained at any
location including at IR-4 facilities.<p>

If you have any questions, please give me a call at (202) 260-7824.<p>

</b><p>

Dear<p>

This is in response to your letter of December 18, 1992, to Dr. David Dull in which you requested
clarification of issues related to compliance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice Standards ((GLPS).  Your letter was
referred
to my office for reply.<p>

Specifically you asked for clarification regarding the allowable relationship of a study director to
management during the conduct of a GLP study.  You stated that within your company you
represent the single point of control for all operations conducted by personnel, including financial
and technical oversight.  Your company___________, is about to conduct field studies program
sponsored by an industry Task Force, and has been requested to provide the study director for
the program.  Industry representatives have expressed to you the belief that the top management
person (i.e., the CEO, or yourself) of a management company cannot act as the study director. 
You asked whether it is necessary for you to assign a subordinate to the role of study director
rather than assume the responsibility yourself.<p>

You proposed an organizational structure whereby: (1) a representative of the sponsoring
company or the Task Force would serve as [testing facility] management, as defined at 40 CFR
160.31; (2) you would serve as study director, as defined at 40 CFR 160.33; (3)    QA [quality
assurance] officer would report to you (as study director) and to the sponsoring company or the
Task Force representative (as management).  All field testing facility QA Units would follow the
same reporting structure; and (4) while you would delegate authority for many of the day-to-day
field or analytical activities, you would remain the single point of control for each study.  You
would approve the protocol for each study as well as all amendments or deviations within a given
study [and] would sign the final study report.<p>

The scenario that you proposed would not achieve full compliance with GLPS.  As you appear to
be aware, there are compliance problems that result from testing facility management
responsibilities being assumed by the individual who is also the study director.  These problems
are not completely solved by your proposed approach.<p>

Since you stated in your letter that you are responsible for all activities at        it appears that,
despite the proposed organizational structure, you retain significant testing facility management
responsibilities.  In particular this creates problems with 40 CFR 160.35 since the QA unit's
independence from study personnel is compromised.  It is also not clear how the responsibilities
at 40 CFR 160.31(g) are met.<p>

These conflicts cannot be solved simply be designating the sponsor as testing facility
management.  "Management" of a testing facility spanning several organization may need to
include management components of the different organizations, including in this case both the
sponsor organization and when this occurs, it is critical that the responsibilities of each
management component are known.  In your scenario the division of management functions
between the sponsor and _______      are not clearly defined.<p>

<p>

Several modifications or clarifications would need to be made to the framework you proposed to
resolve the problems mentioned above.<p>

First, it would be necessary to use a QA Unit which is external to ________            a QA Unit
which is employed by the study director is not independent from the study director, even if a
separate external "management" entity is interposed for the duration of the study.<p>

Second, it must be made clear that "management" consists of both sponsor and components. 
Certain duties must be assumed at a level above ____      such as the responsibility to designate
or replace, as necessary, the study director (40 CFR 160.31(a) and (b)), and the responsibility to
designate the QA Unit (40 CFR 160.31(c)).  On the other hand, other duties must be assumed by
individuals responsible for on-site management, such as assuring that resources are available as
scheduled (40 CFR 160.31(c)).  This appears to require that ____        personnel (in this case,
the study director) assume certain testing facility management duties.<p>

Third, there must be clear documentation indicating which persons are responsible for executing
which duties.  The facility's standard operating procedures must accurately reflect the divisions of
duties.  A historical file of such standard operating procedures must be maintained as stated at
40 CFR 160.81(d).<p>

Finally, there is a technical correction needed for some of the language in your proposal.  Your
scenario provided for the study director to approve the protocol and all amendments or
deviations to it.  Please note that it is the sponsor's duty, not the study director's, to approve the
protocol including amendments.  The study director is responsible for signing and dating the
approved protocol as well as all changes in or revisions to the protocol, but is not empowered
under the regulations to "approve" the protocol or any changes to it.<p>

If you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my staff at
(703) 308-8290.<p>

     Test substance storage container retention<p>

</b><p>

Dear<p>

This is in reply to your letter of March 19, 1993, in which you requested a waiver for certain
requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).<p>

Specifically, you requested that the retention requirement for test substance storage containers,
as provided at 40 CFR 160.105(c) be waived with respect to a study (identified by your
identification code as _____) which you are performing.  The study in question is an applicator
exposure study which your company is conducting in conjunction with the California Department
of Pesticide Regulations.<p>

You stated in your request that the number of replicates (40), the amount of test substance
(400,000 to 700,000 pounds), and the size of the containers (1280 pound bags) creates a
logistical dilemma with respect to container retention.  You also stated that as part of your
company's environmental stewardship, all commercial containers are recycled.<p>

In a telephone discussion on May 18, 1993, with Steve Howie of my staff, you further identified
the test substance as "Ordram 10-G," (10%n granular), EPA Registration No. 10182-174,
Establishment No. 10182-CA-2.  You described the study as a worker exposure study which
began (protocol signature date) on April 19,1993, with applications of the test substance to the
test system occurring during the period of May 1 - June 15,1993.<p>

EPA believes that the provision for assignment of storage containers for the duration of the study
at 40 CFR 160.105(c) is a logical and necessary standard.  In most cases this provision provides
accountability of test material in a manner that imposes no unusual burden.  In this particular
case we agree that the number of containers may pose unusual encumbrance problems.<p>

Our staff has reviewed this request and proposal in view of the need to provide complete
accountability for the test material and the potential burden involved in storing and accounting for
the number of containers mentioned described above.  It is our opinion that certain
recordkeeping steps could provide a basis for establishing an acceptable alternate method for
the accounting of test substance storage containers in lieu of actual storage of the containers for
the duration of this study.  We are willing to allow _________     a conditional exception to this
requirement.<p>

This exception is applicable to the study that you cited in your letter and described above
_________ and is conditional on the following:<p>

1)  ____________ shall assure the following records are maintained as raw data for this study: 
(a) information of shipments pertaining to each container leaving the storage site (examples of
such records are shipping request records, bills of lading, carrier bills, and monthly inventories of
warehouse activity); (b) test article receipt records at each testing facility; (c) complete use logs
of material taken from containers; (d) a record of the final destination of the container, including
the place and date of disposal or reclaiming, and any appropriate receipts.<p>

2)  A statement shall be included with the statement of compliance or noncompliance required at
40 CFR 160.12 describing that this exception to Good Laboratory Practices is in accordance with
the conditions provided in this letter.<p>

3)  _____________ shall prepare an inventory of empty containers before disposal, including
sufficient information to uniquely identify containers, and shall maintain this inventory in an
up-to-date manner recording all arrivals of empty containers and their disposal.  This record shall
be
maintained as raw data for this study.<p>

4)  ____________ shall identify the locations of facilities: where test material is stored; where
empty containers are stored prior to disposal; where records of use, shipment, and disposal of
containers are maintained; and where the test substance is used in studies (i.e., testing facility). 
Within two weeks of receipt of notification of any pending inspection involving this study,
________________ shall report the location of each of these facilities to:<p>

<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter to Steve Howie, dated, March 17, 1989, concerning
FIFRA
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) compliance in 90-day feeding studies.  In that letter you
described a proposed setup where mixed feeds would be stored in the same rooms as the
feeding studies, following preparation elsewhere.  You requested clarification concerning the
acceptability of your procedures in relation to FIFRA GLP standards.<p>

<p>

     Your procedures include storage of the unmixed test material in a separate, locked room,
while
preparation of the mixtures is performed in another separate room on a weekly basis.  Storage of
each mixture is in protected containers (double bagged, tied, in a separate covered, labelled
container) on a non-wooden pallet covered with plastic sheeting in a far corner of the animal
room.  The animal room, as described in your letter, is designated to that study only.<p>

<p>

     The GLPs at 40 CFR 160.47(a) require separate areas for test and control substance
receipt and
storage, mixing, and mixture storage.  At 40 CFR 160.47(b), the storage areas for test and
control substances and mixtures are required to be separate from areas housing the test
systems, as well as adequate to preserve the identity, strength, purity, and stability of the
substances and mixtures.<p>

<p>

     There is a need to exercise judgement, since there is no specific definition of separate area
or of
the time frame intended by the term storage.  Consideration must be given to the use of animal
testing rooms primarily as testing rooms and not as storage rooms.  EPA interprets the rule as
allowing working quantities only of a mixture to be kept in the room housing the test system. 
Working quantities of a feed mix are typically considered to consist of a one to two-week supply. 
It would not normally be acceptable to store longer-term supplies of mixtures in a room that is
dedicated to housing test systems.  It would in any case be necessary to follow procedures that
assure that the placing of working quantities of the mixture in the test room does not compromise
the integrity of the mixture or otherwise jeopardize the study.<p>

<p>

     The procedures that you described in your letter are in accordance with our interpretation
of 40
CFR 160.47 and would thus be considered by our office to comply with the FIFRA GLP rule.  If
you have any questions concerning this response, please call Steve Howie of my staff at (202)

<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in reply to your letter of April 25, 1990, in which you requested interpretations of
Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice standards
(GLPs). 
Specifically, your letter addressed the issue of the study director, as required at 40 CFR 160.33. 
According to your letter, when conducting studies on pesticides for hps, you find it difficult to
comply with the requirements that each study have a single study director.<p>

<p>

     An approach which uses more than one study director per study would not comply with
the
GLPs.  The requirement at 40 CFR 160.33 states that the study director represents the single
point of study control, and is responsible for the overall conduct of the study.  Dividing a
technical
effort into multiple studies creates multiple points of control, and means that there is no individual
with overall responsibility.  The accountability provided by a single study director (who plans,
oversees, and controls the interpretation, analysis, documentation, and reporting of the results) is
one of the most important aspects of the GLP standards.  In addition, the GLPs define a study as
a complete experimental effort.  The definition does not suggest that separate phases either by
location or type of work performed (i.e. analytical versus field) constitute separate studies.<p>

<p>

     A single study director may take overall responsibility for adequate completion of the
study, but
does not have to be directly involved in performance of each technical effort.  For projects
coordinated by _____ the study director would oversee the performance of on-site technical
directors who are responsible for the individuals carrying out field and analytical duties.<p>

<p>

     In order to further explain these issues we are enclosing recent correspondence which
address
the study director issue.  If you have any questions concerning this response or would like to set
up a meeting, please contact Steve Howie of my staff at (202 475-7786.<p>

<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of April 10, 1990, requesting clarification of certain
requirements
of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice
Standards (GLPs).  Specifically, you asked whether the requirements stated at 40 CFR
160.105(e) require that analyses be performed during a study to verify stability of the test,
control, or reference substances under storage conditions at the test site, or, alternatively,
whether stability studies performed prior to the study could obviate the need for such additional
analyses.<p>

<p>

     The GLPs state at 40 CFR 106.105(e) that the stability of test, control, and reference
substances
under storage conditions at the test site must be known for all studies.  In a situation where
stability testing has been previously performed under GLPs and such testing demonstrates
stability under the storage conditions at the test site (i.e., comparable duration, temperature, etc.)
then it is not necessary to retest for stability to comply with GLPs.<p>

<p>

     Where the stability is determined prior to the study under certain conditions, it is necessary
to
know that those conditions apply to the study in question.  If such conditions are not known, or if
stability data are otherwise insufficient, (e.g., not done under GLPs), it is necessary to reaffirm by
either completing stability testing under GLPs before the start of the study or concomitant testing
during the study.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of April 18, 1990 regarding the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide,
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs).  Your letter was
referred to my office for reply.<p>

<p>

     Specifically you requested a waiver of the requirement under GLPs that test substance
storage
containers be retained until the end of a study.  Your request was in specific reference to a study
that involves apply two formulations of ______ to 28 golf courses.  You point out that this study
will involve up to a total of 10,000 test substance containers.  In your letter you request that you
be allowed to dispose of fully used containers and that you be allowed to transfer control of
partially used containers to the cooperating golf course.<p>

<p>

     Our staff has reviewed your request in light of the need to provide complete accountability
of test
material and the potential burden involved in storing and accounting for up to 10,000 containers
in 28 different locations.  We would like to suggest considering the quantities of pesticide
involved in these studies, that use of bulk shipping containers may be a preferable means of
supplying the test substance for these studies.  While it would still be necessary to identify and
keep records of each shipment of test substance, the use of bulk shipping containers would
significantly reduce the number of containers required.<p>

<p>

     However, should bulk containers not be a viable alternative, it is our opinion that certain
recordkeeping steps could provide a basis for establishing an acceptable alternate method for
the accounting of test substance storage containers in lieu of actual storage of the containers for
the duration of this study.  We are willing to allow a conditional exception to this requirement,
provided you notify this office of your intent to adhere to the conditions outlined in this letter.<p>

<p>

     This exception is applicable to the study that you cited in your letter _____ terrestrial field
study
per guideline reference 71-5 using ______ and ____ and is conditional on the following:<p>

<p>

1)   _________ shall maintain records fully accounting for each container and its contents,
from
receipt of the test substance to the ultimate disposition (i.e., disposal, reclamation, or recycling)
of the container.  These records shall be maintained as raw data to this study.  These records
shall include, but not be limited to: (a) information on shipments pertaining to each container
leaving the storage site (examples of such records are shipping request records, bills of lading,
carrier bills, and monthly inventories of warehouse activity); (b) test substance receipt records at
the testing facility and/or testing site(s); (c) complete use logs of material taken from containers,
including quantitation of amounts; (d) a record of the disposition of the container, including the
place, date, and any appropriate receipts<p>

<p>

2)   A statement certifying that all the conditions outlined in this letter were compiled with
shall be
included with the statement of compliance or noncompliance required at 40 CFR 160.12.<p>

<p>

3)   A copy of this letter and a statement certifying that all the conditions outlined in this letter
are
being complied with shall be maintained as raw data for this study and shall be presented upon
any inspection involving this study.<p>

<p>

4)   _______ shall maintain complete records of the transfer of any partially used containers to
a
cooperator or any other person, including identification and amount of the material transferred,
the type of container, and the date of the transfer.<p>

<p>

5)   ________ shall identify the locations of facilities: where test substance is stored; where
empty
containers are stored prior to disposition; where records of use, shipment, and disposition of
containers are maintained; and where the test substance is used in studies (i.e., testing site(s)). 
Within two weeks of receipt of notification of any pending inspection involving this study, ____

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of June 26, 1990.  In that letter, you requested a waiver
of the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practices  (FLP)
requirements at 40 CFR part 160.105(c), which require the assignment of test substance storage
containers for the duration of a study.  Your request is in reference to a forest dissipation study
using triclopyr and picloram.<p>

<p>

     According to your letter, this study will involve approximately 200 2.5 gallon containers
(500
gallons).  You requested the waiver because: (1) all products of each compound are from the
same lot number; (2) each product has been assayed for composition; (3) the requirement would
cause storage and transportation problems; and (4) the day 0 application dose will be monitored
by pre-application tank samples, field-exposed filters, and post application soil samples.<p>

<p>

     The purpose of 40 CFR 160.105(c) is to assure that test substances are stored in proper
containers, and that the containers that are used can be accounted for during the study. 
Normally, retention of the containers (i.e., assignment for the duration of the study), provides
these assurances in a manner that is not a great burden.<p>

<p>

     Our staff has reviewed your request in light of the need to provide complete accountability
of test
substance and the potential burden involved in storing and accounting for approximately 200 2.5

     This exception is applicable to the study that you cited in your letter and is conditional on
the
following:<p>

<p>

1)   _____ shall maintain records fully accounting for each container, and its contents, from
receipt of
the test substance to the ultimate disposition (i.e., disposal, reclamation, or recycling) of the

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of March 15, 1990.  In that letter, you requested a waiver
of the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practices  (FLP)
requirements at 40 CFR part 160.105(c), which require the assignment of test substance storage
containers for the duration of a study.  Your request is in reference to terrestrial and aquatic field
studies where large amounts of pesticide may be used as part of the study.<p>

<p>

     In your letter you stated that conforming to this standard could cause safety hazards and
potential violations of state and local laws.  You listed the amounts required of seven pesticides
being applied to a total of 11 sites, ranging from 120 gallons (in 5 gallon cans) at one site to
121,000 lbs (in 50 lb bags) at another, and listed an additional pesticide and site for which the
precise amount to be used was not yet known.  You requested a general waiver for these
studies, and for any others in 1990 where more than 20 gallons or 50 pounds of pesticide are to
be used.  Finally, you included a draft copy of your chain of custody standard operating
procedures and forms to be used to document receipt, use, storage and disposition of test
substances during field studies.<p>

<p>

     Our staff has reviewed your request in light of the need to provide complete accountability
of test
material and the potential burden involved in storing and accounting for over 2400 containers in
twelve different locations.  It is our opinion that certain recordkeeping steps could provide a basis
for establishing an acceptable alternate method for the accounting of test substance storage
containers in lieu of actual storage of the containers for the duration of this study, and are willing
to allow a conditional exception to this requirement.<p>

<p>

     This exception is applicable to the studies that you cited in your letter, except for the
_____
study, which will require a separate waiver request when the precise amount of pesticide and
number of containers is known, and is conditional on the following:<p>

<p>

1)   _____ shall maintain records fully accounting for each container, and its contents, from
receipt of
the test substance to the ultimate disposition (i.e., disposal, reclamation, or recycling) of the

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of June 7, 1990, to Dr. David Dull, regarding EPA policy
regarding the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory
Practice standards (GLPs).  This letter was referred to my office for reply.<p>

<p>

     Specifically, you asked about the standard at 40 CFR 160.105(c) which requires test
substance
storage containers to be assigned for the duration of a study.  You described this as causing
problems during residue field trials, where the standard may result in the retention of many empty
or near-empty containers for a substantial period of time; this could result in space and safety
problems.  As a solution you proposed that a photograph of the container (label intact, and
punctured or otherwise rendered unusable) be kept in study files throughout the study.  You
stated that this would satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 160.105(c) by providing documented
evidence that the container was only used for that particular substance for the duration of the
study.<p>

<p>

     Assignment of test substance containers for the duration of a study can best be assured by
container retention, which is normally not a great burden.  On several occasions, persons
conducting or sponsoring studies have written EPA do explain that, in the case of a specific
study which they were conducting or planning to conduct, the retention of empty containers
would cause encumbrance or safety problems.  We have reviewed such cases and made
exceptions on an individual basis, with conditions to assure container accountability.<p>

<p>

     We are presently continuing our policy of individual review of such cases.  Your
suggested
approach of using photographic evidence may be useful as a supplemental condition to assure
container accountability, but only in the case that it is in conjunction with and under the
conditions provided for a specific, approved exception.  We currently consider 40 CFR
160.105(c) as requiring retention of test substance storage containers unless such an individual
exception is made.<p>

<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of February 4, 1991, to Connie Musgrove.  In that letter
you
requested written guidance regarding the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs).<p>

<p>

     Specifically, you requested guidance regarding the applicability of GLPs to certain product
performance (efficacy) studies.  You stated that it was your understanding that GLPs do not
apply to horn fly and tick control on cattle, ked control on sheep, lice control on swine, flea
control
on dogs, etc., during the research phase prior to submission for registration and product
approval.  You further stated that you did not believe that there could be subsequent imposition
of GLPs to such studies "after the fact" if the EPA calls in such data after product
registration.<p>

<p>

     The GLPs state that 40 CFR 160.3 under the definition of the term "study" that it applies
to
efficacy studies as required at 40 CFR 158.640.  The table at 40 CFR 158.640 lists only
antimicrobial agents, nematicides and fungicides, and vertebrate control agents.  It does not
currently include herbicides or insecticides, and hence does not cover the testing you mentioned,
except when specific requests for such data are made under FIFRA 3(c)(2)(B).<p>

<p>

     If EPA specifically requires an efficacy study to be submitted, it is considered to be
required
under 40 CFR 158.640 which states: "The Agency reserves the right to require, on a case-by-case
basis, submission of efficacy data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for
registration."  Even though such data may not be explicitly listed in the data requirement table of
that section, and may involve an insecticide or herbicide, it must be accompanied by a statement
of compliance or non-compliance.<p>

<p>

     Where GLPs were not required at the time that a study was performed (e.g., the study was
not
performed specifically to meet the requirements of a data call in), the EPA does not expect to
find such study in total conformity with GLPs after the fact, and will not automatically reject the
data submission for failure to comply.  However, the EPA reserves the right to determine the
adequacy of such data, including whether it can be reconstructed, and to reject data of
questionable or known integrity.  A non-GLP study submitted without a statement (i.e., as
specified at 40 CFR 160.12) which states whether or not the study did meet all GLP
requirements or which identifies all discrepancies with GLPs may be rejected as not providing
sufficient information for the Agency to make an informed decision.  Finally, deviations from the
GLPs may in fact result in rejection of the study as insufficient to meet the data requirement.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of December 12, 1990, in which you requested
clarification
regarding applicability of Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs) to certain data submissions required to support pesticide
registrations held by _____.  Specifically, you asked: (1) whether an analytical method submitted
under 40 CFR 158.120 (guideline 62-3) or under 40 CFR 158.240 (guideline 171-4)is considered
a study; and (2) if so, how GLP protocol and quality assurance unit (QAU) recordkeeping and
inspection requirements apply when the "data" is developmental in nature.<p>

<p>

     The GLPs as stated at 40 CFR 160.1 apply to the conduct of all studies which support, or
are
intended to support, pesticide registrations.  When test method verification work is performed per
the cited guidelines for submission to EPA it must be conducted according to GLPs.  However,
as defined under the FIFRA GLPs, the term "study" does not apply to basic exploratory studies
performed "to determine whether...a test method has any potential utility."  Therefore data which
are developmental in nature would not be under GLP protocol and QAU requirements.<p>

<p>

     Please note that <u>Federal Register</u> of May 14,1988, (53 FR 15952) recodified
certain data
requirements.  The enforcement analytical method requirement, previously located at 40 CFR
158.120, is now located at 40 CFR 158.180.  The residue chemistry method requirement is still
located at 40 CFR 158.240.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of February 23, 1990, to David Dull requesting
clarification
concerning Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs) under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).  Your letter was referred to my office.<p>

     In your letter you specifically requested clarification concerning mixtures of substances
with
carriers, for which the FIFRA GLP requirements are stipulated at 40 CFR 160.113.  You stated
that this standard appears to require that an analytical chemistry analysis be performed each
time that a disinfectant is diluted for efficacy testing under the GLPs.  You suggested that this is
impractical due to the capabilities of laboratories that normally perform such testing and the fact
that such dilutions must be prepared fresh for each test<p>

     The GLPs state at 40 CFR 160.113(a) that for each test, control, or reference substance
that is
mixed with a carrier, tests by appropriate methods shall be conducted to determine,
"...periodically, the concentration of the test, control, or reference substance in the mixture."  This
requirement clearly applies to dilutions of disinfectants used in efficacy testing, just as it would for
dilutions of agricultural pesticides used in studies involving field application.<p>

     However, this requirement does not apply to each batch of mixture prepared.  The term
"mixture"
means a particular combination of ingredients, but is not restricted to mean only a particular
batch or preparation involving those ingredients.  Therefore, requirements regarding a mixture
used in a particular test may be met by testing any preparation or batch of the mixture involving
the same combination of ingredients.  This testing must be sufficient to assure that the
parameters stated in 40 CFR 160.113 are adequately supported, but need not be repeated for
each batch or preparation unless there is a special reason to do so.  Further, there is flexibility
concerning where, when and by whom such testing is performed, except that solubility and
stability testing have time constraints as specified at 40 CFR 160.113(a) (2) and (3).<p>

<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of December 11, 1989, to Dr. David Dull regarding
Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP standards.  That letter was transmitted to my office for reply.<p>

     In your letter you raised questions regarding: (1) the time-frame allowed for archiving raw
data at
the close of studies: (2) EPA's interpretation of the meaning of "four week duration," in reference
to sections 160.105(d) and 792.105(d); and (3) what EPA's plans are concerning making
compilations of interpretations and clarifications available to the public.<p>

     Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory
Practice
standards (GLPs), there must be archives for orderly storage and expedient retrieval of all raw
data, documentation, protocols, specimens, and interim and final reports (40 CFR 160.190(b)). 
Further, the study director is required to assure that all such records are transferred to the
archives during or at the close of the study (40 CFR 160.33(f)).  This ensures that data are fully
accounted for at the completion of the study.  This must be completed prior to signing the
compliance statement.<p>

     There is flexibility in the location of the archives of raw data and specimens.  At 40 CFR
160.190(b), the GLPs state that retention of records at alternate locations is acceptable, provided
that there is specific reference to those locations in the archives.  Such off-location archives
must still meet the full requirements of 40 CFR 160.190.  Whether records are archived at a
central location or at separate contractors' locations, the study director must assure that all raw
data and specimens have been archived before the study report is signed.  In the case that the
study director cannot assure that records at a particular location are archived correctly, he cannot
sign a compliance statement that indicates that this standard has been met.<p>

     The sponsor is ultimately responsible for the raw data supporting the study (e.g., 40 CFR
169.2(k)), and may request archived records to be shipped to the sponsor's archives at some
date following a study.  Alternatively, a testing facility may wish to consolidate archives at one
location during or after a study.  Such transfers of archives do not present a problem if the
records are properly accounted for and the testing facility maintains records of the archive
location(s) at all times.<p>

     Please note that this position regarding archiving also applies to the TSCA GLP standards
at 40
CFR Part 792.<p>

     As you indicated in your letter, the term "four week experimental duration" is tied to the
experimental start and termination dates.  This is clarified in the preambles to the August 17,
1989 rules amending the FIFRA GLPs (54 FR 34052, 34061) and the TSCA GLPs (54 FR
34034,
34040).  These dates are clearly defined, and are not limited to the period of administration of the
test substance.<p>

     Finally, EPA is preparing a question and answer document to improve communication of
interpretations regarding GLPs to the regulated community.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of February 27,1991.  In that letter you described an
oncogenicity study, sponsored by the _____, currently being conducted at the _____.  As you
have indicated, the study will require an anticipated 24 fifty-five gallon drums of _____.  The
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations (40 CFR &amp; 792.1 <u>et seg</u>) require,
among other
things, that each storage container for a test, control, or reference substance be assigned to a
particular substance for the duration of the study (40 CFR section 792.105(c)).<p>

     EPA believes that the provision for the assignment of storage containers for the duration
of a
study is a logical and necessary provision of the GLP regulations.  In most cases this
requirement provides accountability of test material in a manner which poses no unusual burden. 
However, due to the limited storage facilities at the _____, and the highly volatile and flammable
nature of the substance in question _____ this GLP requirement may present an unusual burden
to the _____, as well as a potentially hazardous situation.<p>

     In granting previous exemptions to this provision of the GLP regulations, EPA has
established
stringent recordkeeping requirements as an alternate method of accounting for the storage
containers in lieu of actual storage for the duration of the study.  For the purposes of exemption
from the assignment requirements for this study, EPA will require that the following
documentation be retained for the duration of the study: 1) purchase and shipping receipts for all
_____ storage containers received at the _____ (certified copies dated and signed by
responsible persons will be considered adequate); and 2) records of the final destination of the
storage containers such as receipts from the recycler or reclaimer (again, dated and signed
certified copies will be adequate).<p>

     Additionally, this exemption from the assignment requirements for the above study is
conditional
on the following:<p>

1)   for this study, a statement shall be included with the statement of compliance or
noncompliance
required at 40 CFR section 792.12(b) explaining that this exception to the Good Laboratory
Practices regulations is in accordance with the requirements provided in this letter;<p>

2)   an inventory shall be prepared of all empty containers before disposal, including sufficient
information to uniquely identify containers.  This inventory shall be maintained in an up-to-date
manner, recording all shipments of empty containers and their disposal.  This record shall be
maintained for the duration of the study;<p>

3)   identification of the locations of the facilities where test material is stored, where empty
containers are stored prior to disposal or recycling, where records of shipment of containers are
maintained, and where the test substance is used in the study (i.e. testing facility).  Within two
weeks of receipt of this letter, the location of each of these facilities shall be reported to:<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter dated April 28, 1991.  In that letter, you repeated a
request for
exemption from one of the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Good
Laboratory Practices regulations (GLPs) for a study being conducted at the _____.  The letter
containing your initial request was dated February 27, 1991.  Our response to that inquiry was
issued May 16, 1991.<p>

     Your April 28 letter raises one question regarding your request.  In that letter, which you
said was
to correct your February letter, you changed the citation of the regulation from which you have
requested an exemption.  In the first letter you cited the TSCA GLP provision (40 CFR &amp;
792.105(c)).  Your second letter, however, cites the same requirement for the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) GLPs (40 CFR % 160.105(c)).  As you
mentioned TSCA in both of your letters, I assume that you are seeking a TSCA exemption, and
the second (FIFRA) citation was incorrect.  Please contact me at (202) 382-7825 if there is any
further confusion in this matter or if you have not received our original response.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of June 10, 1990, to Mr. Steve Howie, of my staff.  In
that letter
you requested clarification on Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practices standard (GLPs) with respect to analytical method development and
validation.<p>

     You asked whether a company must revalidate a method under GLPs in the case where it
had
established the analytical methodology and included validation data in an EPA study submitted
prior to the effective date of the GLPs requirements.<p>

     The GLPs do not specifically require that each method used in a study be revalidated
under
GLPs.  However, there are certain cases where such method validation, or the gathering of data
to support method validation, would be required to be performed under GLPs:<p>

(1)  If the protocol of the study includes method validation, this information must be gathered
under
GLPs.<p>

(2)  Regardless of whether a separate validation study is performed, calibration data must be
gathered and maintained under GLPs, and any other applicable portions of GLPs must also be
adhered to, i.e. maintenance and calibration of equipment, standard operating procedures, etc.<p>

(3)  If the EPA determines that revalidation of a particular method must be performed as part
of a
study, or for subsequent use in studies, that would be under GLPs regardless of whether a
previous study had been submitted.<p>

     If there is a question concerning the acceptability of an analytical method, i.e., whether
further
validation is required, it is appropriate to contact the Office of Pesticides Programs.<p>

     If you have any questions please call Steve Howie of my staff at (703) 308-8290.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of July 18, 1990, regarding questions on Federal
Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs).  Your questions
restated and answered below:<p>

     1.a.  Where a subcontractor with an independent quality assurance unit is performing work
and
generating a report for a sponsor, is a compliance statement required for the analytical report?<p>

     Response: Under GLPs there is no requirement to have a compliance statement in
each subunit of the
overall study such as an analytical report.  However, assurance of compliance may be needed by
the sponsor or study director, so that they can truthfully sign the compliance statement. 
Arrangement for such assurances must be worked out between the subcontractor, the study
director and the sponsor.<p>

     1.b.  Do the GLPs mandate that the quality assurance inspections conducted at the
subcontractor's facility be reported to both the study director and the "management"?  Should
management include management at both the sponsor and subcontractor facilities?<p>

     Response: The GLPs require at 40 CFR 160.35(b)(4) that status reports be
periodically submitted to both
the study director and management.  "Management" refers to testing facility management, i.e.,
the person whose responsibilities are stated under 40 CFR 160.31.  It is not necessary under
GLPs for the QAU to submit multiple management reports, i.e., to both the sponsor and
subcontractor management, as long as reports are submitted to the correct person to discharge
the duties specified at 40 CFR 160.31.<p>

     2.  The preamble of the GLPs regulations states at 160.35(b)(3) that each study, no matter
how
short, must be inspected at least once while in progress.  To what extent would the following fulfil
this requirement: a) a protocol audit; b) a raw data audit; or c) a draft report review including
confirmation the report reflects the raw data?<p>

     Response: All of these types of audits may be useful.  But please note that there must
be enough coverage
for a given facility during all audits and inspections so that all aspects of testing are covered.  As
stated at 40 CFR 160.35(a), the coverage must include facilities, equipment, protocols,
personnel, methods, practices, records, and controls.  It is not necessary to separately address
all of these aspects for each study, as long as overall coverage, that is, the sum of all
inspections, is balanced to include all aspects.  Therefore, protocol audits, raw data audits, and
draft report reviews must not be the sole focus of inspections.<p>

Dear<p>

This is in response to your letter of March 20, 1990, to David Dull in which you raised questions
on EPA's policy regarding retention of raw data as required under section 8 of the Federal
Insecticide Fungicide, Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).  Specifically, you addressed the regulatory
requirements for the retention of all underlying raw data at 40 CFR 169.2(k) and the Good
Laboraory Practice standards (GLPs) definition of  "raw data" at 40 CFR 160.3 and records
retention requirement at 40 CFR 160.195(i).<p>

It was your contention that these requirements do not conflict since: (1) FIFRA section 8(a)
provides that the Administrtor may prescribe regulations requiring retention of records; (2)
although registrants are required at 40 CFR 169.2 (k) to retain all underlying raw data, the term
"raw data" is not therein defined; (3) "raw data is defined in the GLPs at 40 CFR 1603 which
provides that "exact copies" of transcripts of raw data may be substituted for original rawdata;
and (4) it is stated further under GLPs at 40 CFR 160.195(i), that records "required by this part
may be ...true copies..."; that it is permissible for persons to substitute exact copies for original
records to meet all regulatory needs for raw data retention.  You further state that, since the term
"exact copy" is not in itself defined, companies must set their own policy regarding what
consitutes an "exact copy" and be prepared to defend it.<p>

Please note that GLPs include specific archiving requirements for raw data, e.g. indexing for
retrieval, minimization of deterioration, protected access, etc.  Certain procedures may not be
practicable with original records.  For example, heat sensitive papers may deteriorate with time,
while oversized charts and tape-recorded voice records may be difficult to index for expedient
retrieval.  After copies are made to assure compliance with GLP archiving requirements, the
original records must still be retained to assure compliance with 40 CFR 169.2(k).<p>

We agree that there is no conflict between GLPs and FIFRA section 8 regulations.  However,
GLPs must not be viewed as superseding the records retention requirements stated at 40 CFR
169.2(k), or of providing regulatory clarification of terminology used in 40 CFR 169.2(k). 
Consequently, compliance with GLPs may be accomplished through retention of copies of raw
data, but the destruction of original records would still be a violation of the provisions stated at 40
CFR 169.2(k).<p>

I hope this answers your questions.  If you have further questions please contact Steve Howie of
my staff at (703) 308-8290.<p>

     This is in response to your letter of January 15, 1991, requesting information on the EPA
interpretation of current Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPs) with respect to retention of
mutagenicity test specimens.  You asked for a formal determination of whether your client's
mutagenicity specimens need to be retained.<p>

     Specifically, your client, _____, was archiving 782 petri dishes and 362 slides in
conjunction with
three mutagenicity tests.  Final reports were submitted to EPA on July 27, 1988.  You stated that
the only response to the submission of the data to date has been the EPA acknowledgement that
the data passed the formatting screen and had been assigned MRID numbers.<p>

     Please refer to the preamble of the final rule amending the GLPs (54 FR 34066, August
17,
1989, enclosed).  A commenter had asked what the term "quality assurance verification" meant. 
EPA responded that specimens must be retained until the quality assurance unit assures that
discarding the specimens does not negatively impact the integrity of the study.  Therefore, once
the testing facility quality assurance unit determines that the discarding of the specimens will not
negatively impact the integrity of the study, the materials in question may be discarded.  There is
no need to await the final EPA approval of the report or EPA inspection, under current EPA GLP
requirements.<p>

Dear<p>

     This letter is in response to your October 29, 1991 letter to me requesting a waiver of the
GLP
requirement to retain the original container of _____ which will be used in a worker exposure
study.  In your letter you state that the original container will be a railroad car or a large tanker
truck.  The test material will be pumped from the tanker trucks directly to nurse tanks for
application.  To further clarify this point, you stated to Dan Helfgott of my staff in a telephone
conversation on October 310, 1991, that the material is going directly from the railroad car or
tank truck to the application device and that there will be no intermediate storage of the
product.<p>

     If there will be no intermediate storage of the test substance, _____ will not be required to
meet
the requirement of 40 CFR 160.105(c) which states that storage containers shall be assigned to
a particular test substance for the duration of the study.  However, the Statement of Compliance
required by 40 CFR 160.12, which must be submitted with the study, must reflect this deviation
from the GLPs.  It would also be beneficial to include an explanation of why you were unable to
meet this requirement.<p>

     In lieu of the requirement of 40 CFR 160.105(c), you will need to take additional steps to
document that the substance used in the study was the material delivered from the rail car or
tank truck.  Therefore, _____ must maintain as raw data the records of delivery, and the identity
and net contents of the material delivered.  Such documentation may be in the form of the bill of
lading or carrier bills, and a copy of the pesticide label.  The use of photographs of the railroad
car or tanker trucks, as you suggested in your letter, is also a good idea.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in reply to your letter of October 29, 1991 in which you requested clarification
regarding
the Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  Specifically, you asked whether the GLPS
allow responsibility for archive maintenance to be assigned to members of a testing facility's
quality assurance unit (AQU).  You are interested in assigning the archive responsibilities to the
Quality Assurance Officer of one of your satellite facilities.<p>

<p>

     The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) GLPs state at 40 CFR
160.190(c) that "...an individual shall be identified as responsible for the archives."  As you have
correctly determined, the regulations do not prohibit assignment of archive responsibilities to a
member of the QAU.  Please note, however, that the regulations are clear that a single individual
must be identified as responsible for archives.  If you were to generically designate an
organizational subunit (i.e., the QAU) as responsible for archives you would not meet this
requirement.<p>

<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of May 21, 1991, to David Dull regarding Good
Laboratory
Practice Standards (GLPS).  That letter was referred to me for reply.  Although not specifically
described, it is assumed that you are interested in an interpretation regarding the GLPS
regulations promulgated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA).<p>

     In your letter you asked whether your facility would be in compliance with GLPS when
using a
generic protocol system.  Specifically, a generic protocol describing certain requirements
common to similar studies would be transmitted to a sponsor for review and approval.  The
approved generic protocol would be transmitted back to your facility and copies would be
maintained at both your facility and the sponsor's facility.  For each specific study, a letter of
authorization would be additionally obtained from the sponsor.  The letter of authorization
references the generic protocol, the study name, and the test substance.  Presumably the
authorization letter will include the proposed experimental start and termination dates, and any
other protocol requirements not covered by the generic protocol.<p>

     The type of approach described above could be an acceptable mechanism to obtain
sponsor
approval of the study-specific protocol, as is required at 40 CFR 160.120(a)(14).  Note that a
study protocol must still be drafted for each study which is signed by the study director.  That
study protocol would be considered "approved" by the sponsor if and only if it contains just those
elements contained in the approved generic protocol and the letter of authorization.  It may
contain such elements by referencing the appropriate approved documents, but only if the
documents are themselves maintained and available and the references are clear and
unambiguous.  If there are any elements included in the study protocol which are either not
stated in, are altered from, or are in addition to the elements contained in the approved generic
protocol and/or the letter of authorization, these changes must be additionally approved by the
sponsor and the date(s) of approval maintained with the protocol.<p>

     Records of the approval of the generic protocol and the letter of authorization, as well as
records
of all approved changes or revisions to the protocol must be maintained with the study protocol
and signed and dated by the study director.  It is presumed that instructions from the sponsor to
alter an existing protocol constitute approval of protocol changes.<p>

Keywords: Test Substance Storage Container Retention<p>

<hr>
</b><p>

<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of November 11, 1991.  In your letter you requested a
waiver of
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practices
(GLP) requirement at 40 CFR part 160.105(c), which require the assignment of test substance
storage containers for the duration of a study.<p>

     Your request is in reference to your 1991/1992 terrestrial field study where large amounts
of
pesticide are in use as part of the study, with applications in October 10 1991 and March of 1992. 
You stated that there would be a large number of containers and that the long term retention and
storage of these containers would represent a safety hazard and potential conflicts with state and
local regulations.  You proposed to perform certain steps to assure container accountability in
lieu of retaining the actual containers for the duration of the study.<p>

     EPA believes that the provision for assignment of storage containers for the duration of
the study
at 40 CFR 160.105(c) is a logical and necessary provision that in most cases provides
accountability of test material in a manner that imposes no unusual burden.  In your particular
case, however, the number of containers may pose unusual safety and encumbrance problems.<p>

     Our staff has reviewed your request in light of the need to provide complete accountability
of test
material and the potential burden involved in storing and accounting for approximately 1600
containers.  It is our opinion that certain recordkeeping steps could provide a basis for
establishing an acceptable alternate method for the accounting of test substance storage
containers in lieu of actual storage of the containers for the duration of this study, and willing to
allow a conditional exception to this requirement.<p>

     This exception is applicable only to the study that you described in the confidential
attachment to
your letter of November 11, 1991, and is conditional on the following:<p>

1)   _____________ shall assure the following records are maintained as raw data for this
study: (a)
information of shipments pertaining to each container leaving the storage site (examples of such
records are shipping request records, bills of lading, carrier bills, and monthly inventories of
warehouse activity); (b) test article receipt records at each testing facility; (c) complete use logs
of material taken from containers: (d) a record of the final destination of the container, including
the place and date of disposal or reclaiming, and any appropriate receipts.<p>

2)   A statement shall be included with the statement of compliance or noncompliance required
at 40
CFR 160.12 describing that this exception to Good Laboratory Practices is in accordance with
the conditions provided in this letter.<p>

3)   ____________ shall prepare an inventory of empty containers before disposal, including
sufficient information to uniquely identify containers, and shall maintain this inventory in an
up-to-date manner recording all arrivals of empty containers and their disposal.  This record shall
be
maintained as raw data for this study.<p>

4)   ____________ shall identify the locations of facilities: where test material is stored; where
empty
containers are stored prior to disposal; where records of use, shipment, and disposal of
containers are maintained; and where the test substance is used in studies (i.e., testing facility). 
Within two weeks of receipt of notification of any pending inspection involving this study,
Terrestrial Field Studies, Inc. shall report the location of each of these facilities to:<p>

          David Dull, Director<p>

401 M Street SW <br>

     Should these conditions not be fully met, all of the provisions of 40 CFR 160 (GLPs),
including
assignment of storage containers for the duration of the study, apply.<p>

     In addition, ____________ is reminded that storage, disposal, or recycling of containers
must be
done in a manner pursuant to all applicable Federal, State, County or local laws.<p>

<BR>
<HR3>REPORT OF QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES</HR3></B><P>
         
 On July 21, 1994 the SQA Regulatory Review Committee met with Dr. David Dull and Ms.
Francisca Liem of the EPA Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. Dr. Dull and Ms.
Liem were asked various questions that had been submitted by the RRC members.<P>
         
The following report on this meeting contains the questions asked as well as a summary of the
responses. This report is being provided to the SQA membership to help keep everyone informed
and up-to-date on current GLP issues.<P>
         
Please note the responses are Dr. Dull's and Ms. Liem's reported opinions and interpretations on
the issues. They should not be considered as official EPA policy, such as Advisories. These
responses like Advisories, may depend on individual circumstances and should be evaluated
carefully to determine if they are applicable to a situation.  In many cases, there is more than one
way to accomplish compliance with GLP regulations.<P>

<A NAME= rrb5-1">
<B>GENERAL<P>
<I>QUESTION 1:  </I>Would you please give us an update on the status of current EPA
activities<P>
<UL>
<LI>  reorganization, EPA reporting structure<BR>
<LI>  current inspection program initiatives and emphasis<BR>
<LI>  planning and strategies<BR>
<LI>  what inspection results are indicating to EPA, current trends<BR>
<LI>  status of the MOUs between the US EPA and the European countries/OECD and
Japan<BR>
<LI>  current budgetary constraints</B><P>
</UL>
         
<B><I>ANSWER 1:</I></B>  The reorganization is complete. The new Office of Enforcement
and Compliance Assurance (OECA) has been established. The head is Steven Herman. formerly
with the Department of Justice who brings strong enforcement credentials. The OECA is divided
into the Office of Criminal Enforcement (OCE). Office of Regulatory Enforcement (ORE),
Office of Compliance (OC) and National Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC). ORE is
responsible for issues related to water, air, hazardous waste, and pesticides and toxic substances
and is the office where enforcement cases will be developed. The Office of Compliance will
focus on nontraditional methods of assuring compliance, such as fostering compliance through
compliance assistance and outreach. The position of Director of OC is held by Elaine Stanley.
The OC is divided into divisions which include Enforcement Planning. Manufacturing, Chemical
(waste), and Agricultural and Ecosystems Sector (AE or AES) Divisions. Dr. Dull was appointed
Associate Director of the AE Division and currently is the Acting Director. The AE is further
divided into the Laboratory Data Integrity Branch (Ms. Liem, Branch Chief), Analytical
Laboratory and Compliance Evaluation Branch (Dean Hill, Branch Chief), and the Agriculture
Branch (Phyllis Flaherty, Branch Chief). The Agriculture Branch will be responsible for FIFRA
pesticide use and compliance plus new programs in ecosystems compliance. The position of
Director of AE has been "posted" but it will probably take months to fill.<P>
         
         There are currently severe budget constraints for salary and travel. There are too many
people for the amount of salary dollars. Since travel money and salary money come from the
same account, EPA is currently using the account to pay salaries. The last EPA inspection was
conducted in the end of March 1994. Recently there has been a small allocation of travel money
under the new OECA to be used from June I - Oct. 1, 1994. EPA will only conduct a few
inspections for the rest of the year and the main focus will be on tips and complaints inspections
and requests from OPP. There are not expected to be any routine neutral scheme targeted
inspections, although some may be conducted at the end of the fiscal year.<P>
         
         Because of the numerous reorganization changes, the OECA has been in a transition
process. Most of OECA's upper management structure is new to the programs and is not familiar
with GLPs. Fiscal year planning for 1995 is in progress and the Agricultural and Ecosystems
Division is competing with 3 other divisions for travel money. Though OECA's role has been
recognized in assuring data quality, there is a need to educate people regarding the GLP
program. It is difficult to obtain support for a program that is not well-recognized. Currently it is
difficult to plan, but it appears that the program will take on an expanded role. Ms. Liem will
have a part in assuring environmental lab compliance under the Resource Conservation
Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA). Inspectors will be conducting
multimedia inspections, (e.g., going into labs that do GLP and environmental testing and
assessing compliance of both areas). In the future, an assessment will be made whether the EPA
GLP program needs to be reoriented based on significantly reduced resources. A new approach
may be required.<P>
         
         There are currently four bilateral MOUs (Japan, Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands) in
place. The MOU with the United Kingdom has expired but EPA and the UK Department of
Health are continuing the full range of actions that were performed under the MOU. EPA is in
the discussion process with Canada regarding a MOU. There have been three formal European
Union (EU) discussions. They were held 6/93 in Washington DC, 4/94 in Brussels, and 6/94 in
Washington DC. The EU wants a blanket MOU covering all 12 member states. However, the
difficulty is recognition of all 12 programs because only a few meet EPA's standards of
acceptability. For this reason, EPA does not want a blanket agreement recognizing all of the
programs.<P>
         
         Last June an OECD field inspector training course was held in San Francisco. This will
help further the goal toward harmonization related to field studies. Next on the horizon for
OECD is a computer guidance document. A meeting will be held soon for discussion of this
topic. OECD will be deciding whether the OECD GLP principles need to be updated but this
decision will not come before Nov. 1994.<P>
         
         Regarding inspection trends, there is still a fair amount of non-compliance. EPA is
expected to have another GLP case initiative this year. Ms. Liem has previously conducted an
analysis of results of field study inspections. The most frequent issues of concern were Study
Director and QA not doing their jobs.<P>
         
         An audience member asked the differences between documents that EPA issues. Dr. Dull
indicated that the GLP regulations are fundamental (law of land), and that nothing else fits into
this category.  Advisories and the Question and Answer document are only interpretative
guidance, and have quasi regulatory status.<P>
<HR>
<BR>
<A NAME= rrb5-2">
<B><I>QUESTION 2:</I> What can sponsors, contract facilities, project management facilities,
and QA do to improve their compliance programs?</B><P>
         
<B><I>ANSWER 2:</I></B>   Spend more money to produce quality studies (e.g., QA).
Sponsors should take more responsibility for all aspects of the study. EPA is concerned about
Project Management Companies acting as buffers. For example, when the Study Director is at
the sponsor level but the Project Manager runs everything this is a problem because the Study
Director does not have overall control. EPA wonders in these cases what the Study Director
does. There is also concern about reporting lines in some facilities, especially QA and study
personnel reporting line conflict issues. It is a key GLP concept that an independent QAU exist. 
According to advisory 72, the person who QA reports to cannot be involved in any part of the
study (even acting as a technician). In these situations, it is EPA's opinion that the facility must
use independent contract QA. The question was then asked regarding situations where some of
these type facilities are setting up a QAU independently on the side but the QA may only
contract with that facility. Dr. Dull responded that EPA will look at what is the "reality" to assess
the situation, not how things look on paper. 

         <P>EPA will also look at good faith efforts to keep walls up for independence. An RRC
member indicated that the key is that we need clear documentation of how we are functioning as
QA and that management is responding and taking necessary corrective action. Dr. Dull
indicated that EPA may be changing emphasis, in the future, by paying more attention to Project
Management Companies and reporting structures.

<A NAME= rrb5-3">
<B><I>QUESTION 3:</I>  Does the OECA have plans to revise 40 CFR Part 160 to
incorporate current interpretations, i.e., the GLP advisories?</B><P>
         
<B><I>ANSWER 3:  </I></B>No. Advisories serve a useful purpose, but are written in
response to specific situations. Problems are sometimes created when people try to use them for
other situations, but the basic principles are good.  There are less advisories currently being
requested than in the past. Requests for advisories should now be sent to the Acting Director of
the Agricultural and Ecosystems Division, Dr. Dull.<P>

<A NAME= rrb5-4">
<B><I>QUESTION 4:</I>    Are there any efforts currently to further harmonize the US EPA
GLPs and the OECD GLPs?</B><P>
 <B><I>ANSWER 4:</I></B>  An "expert group" will discuss harmonization next year. The
focus will be on record keeping and field studies.  Dian Turnheim at OECD is currently doing
side by side comparisons of the regulations.<P>

<A NAME= rrb5-5">
<B><I> QUESTION 5:</I>  Is there any initiative to provide US laboratories with GLP
certification or accreditation similar to that provided by the Japanese and some European
countries?</B><P>
 <B><I>ANSWER 5:  </I></B>This is a complicated issue but Lynn Goodman has become a
firm advocate of lab accreditation. She wants the US program to look more like European
programs (e.g., stamp of approval, approved list).  Elaine Stanley is currently the key person in
charge of the program. Representatives of SQA have met with Elaine Stanley to relay the SQA
position on the subject.<P>

<A NAME= rrb5-6">
<B><I>QUESTION 6: </I> When a study is performed in the USA with the intention of
submitting the study to the EEC for European tolerances, is it acceptable to conduct the study
under US EPA FIFRA GLPs?</B><P>
 <B><I> ANSWER 6:  </I></B>If the study is submitted to the European Economic Community
(EEC) countries that have an MOU regarding GLP compliance, then it is acceptable to follow
US EPA GLP regulations. For other situations there are no formal agreements.<P>
<HR>
<BR>  
<A NAME= rrb5-7">
<B><I> QUESTION 7: </I> During an inspection, would a company be cited for
non-compliance if company policy differed from interpretation given in an advisory, yet
company policy was still compliant with the company's interpretation of the GLP regulations?
Also, is it permissible to petition the Agency to review or reevaluate the interpretation given in
an advisory? If so, what would be the proper procedure to follow?</B><P>
 <B><I>  ANSWER 7: </I></B> The company's interpretation of GLPs could be totally wrong
according to EPA interpretation. If company interpretation differed, EPA would have to look at
the facts and make a judgment.  Advisories represent the Agency's opinion on what the
regulations mean in certain factual situations.  Any reanalysis would have to be done based on
different facts for a different situation. A letter can be sent to Dr. Dull to ask to have an advisory
revisited.<P>
<HR>
<BR>  
<A NAME= rrb5-8">
<B><I>QUESTION 8:</I>  Amending the GLP compliance statement may occasionally be
necessary for various reasons (e.g., at report signing the Study Director was under one
impression and was later informed differently, or for typos). Many items apparently required on
the compliance statement may seem trivial. Does the Agency (according to advisory 71) really
want industry to contact Dr. Dull every time a compliance statement is amended, even for trivial
issues? If so, how should this contact be made?</B><P>
 <B><I> ANSWER 8: </I></B> Regarding submitting a new compliance statement, if it is a
truly trivial situation then perhaps an important enforcement situation does not exist. In this case,
maybe just send OPP the revised compliance statement in an amended report. If the difference is
not trivial and could impact the quality and integrity of the study, then the appropriate action will
be different. The Agency encourages self confessors.  Submitters can call Dr. Dull or write and
ask for meeting to discuss any changes to compliance statements.<P>
<HR>
<BR>  
<A NAME= rrb5-9">
<B><I> QUESTION 9:  </I>What are your recommendations for handling Study Director duties
during absences (e.g., signing final reports)?</B><P>
 <B><I> ANSWER 9:</I></B>  Dr. Dull's view is that EPA recognizes that the Study Director
may not always be available. A sponsor may need to appoint a "Deputy Director" to cover
responsibilities during Study Director sickness or travel.  EPA feels that someone should be left
in charge. However it is Dr. Dull's opinion that signing the protocol (including amendments and
deviations) and final reports cannot be delegated.   Dr. Dull stated that no one else (including
Study Director's management) can sign these items. It is best to assign a new Study Director,
where warranted. Any other approach weakens the Study Director's role.<P>

<B>COMPUTER<P>
<I>         
QUESTION 10: </I> What is the status of the EPA SOP for inspection of computer systems? If
complete, how can a copy be obtained?</B><P>
 <B><I> ANSWER 10:</I></B>  The computer systems inspection SOP is in draft format. It
should be finalized in several months. Copies will then be available from Ms. Liem upon
request.<P>
<HR>
<BR>  
<A NAME= rrb5-11">
<B><I> QUESTION 11:</I>  When, or if, the GALPs are finalized, what does OECA plan to do
with the GALPs document? Also, is EPA conducting any inspections of computer
systems?</B><P>
 <B><I> ANSWER 11: </I></B> Good Automated Laboratory Practice standards (GALPs)
provide valuable guidance but specific terms cannot be enforced. The document has agency wide
approval. If the GLPs are amended in the future, it is likely that parts of the GALPs may be
added. Richard Cooney of the Agricultural and Ecosystems Division, is the "computer expert"
and has been doing some facility inspections of computer systems.<P>

<A NAME= rrb5-12">
QUESTION 12:</I>  It has been indicated by personnel in the Biological and Economic
Analysis Division (BEAD) of the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP), that product performance
testing (efficacy testing) of pesticides will be considered as requiring GLP compliance. Do you
support this? If this is true, how imminent is this? Has EPA considered the economic impact on
the pesticide industry? Will there be opportunity for comment by industry prior to
implementation of such a change? How will the change be implemented?</B><P>
 <B><I>
         
ANSWER 12: </I></B> OPP met recently to discuss amending 40 CFR Part 158 (Herbicide
comparative product performance testing). OPP does not want these studies covered by GLPs
and the Agriculture and Ecosystems Division (AED) has tentatively agreed to this. However,
human health impact efficacy studies may have to be done under GLPs. Once revised. the
document will go to a Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP). Comments will be incorporated, the
document finalized and comments will become part of the preamble. It is estimated that this will
be done by March 1995. A proposed rulemaking will be issued.<P>

<A NAME= rrb5-13">
QUESTION 13:</I>  Regarding full reporting requirements for terminated studies (advisory 70),
many developmental compounds are discontinued prior to seeking a product registration. There
is little reason to spend additional money for writing a report for a study that will never be used
to support a registration. What approach would be recommended for handling these types of
situations?</B><P>
 <B><I>ANSWER 13: </I></B> Advisory 70 clearly stated that a final report must be written
regardless of whether the study will be submitted. The question was asked whether an
amendment could be written indicating that the study is terminated and a report will not be
written. Dr. Dull stated that he did not know what the rationale was for that provision in the
regulations but that a report must be written. An audience member asked how to handle a
situation where the Study Director of a terminated study resides at a contract lab, but the sponsor
decides not to pay to have a final report written. Ms. Liem indicated that it is ultimately the
sponsor s responsibility.<P>

QUESTION 14:</I>  If temperature data for storage locations is documented on forms with
preprinted dates and dates are not "hand-entered" with each entry, does this meet the
requirements of 40 CFR Part 160.130(e) for data being dated on the day of entry? According to
some interpretations as long as the preprinted date matches the date of entry this is in
compliance. If the date does not match, the correct date is hand entered.</B><P>
 <B><I>ANSWER 14:</I></B>  A preprinted date can be a reminder, but there still needs to be
hand entered initials and date. All data entered needs to be initialed and dated.<P>

dilution are prepared daily and the preparation recorded on a form. Is it acceptable to use a form
with preprinted "constant" information if concentrations, volumes and dilutions are
constant?</B><P>
 <B><I>ANSWER 15:</I></B>  It is acceptable to use a preprinted form as long as the entries

<B><I>QUESTION 16:</I>  In the conduct of certain written analytical methods the amount of
sample to be measured is clearly specified (e.g., 250 mL, 20.0 g ). There is no provision for any
amount other than as specified except as a deviation or preapproved modification to the method.
Is it necessary to record the volume or weight for each individual sample as the measurement is
performed or is it sufficient for the analyst to initial and date that this operation of the method
was conducted on a specified group of samples on a given date when the operation for the set is
completed?</B><P>
 <B><I>ANSWER 16:</I></B>  Ms. Liem indicated that the exact amount weighed or
measured needs to be recorded for each sample. It is not acceptable to just record that method
"X' was followed on a certain date. Ms. Liem stated that it is acceptable to use a preprinted form
but each measurement must be documented (i.e., cannot just reference SOP or method).<P>

inspection reports to be sent directly to the QAU at the Sponsor or Project Management Firm for
subsequent forwarding to the Study Director and testing facility management?</B><P>
 <B><I> ANSWER 18: </I></B> Ms. Liem questioned why this intermediate step would be
considered necessary. Audience members gave examples of Sponsor or Project Management
QAU's having overall responsibility (clearly defined) for the study and cases where the QAU is
responsible for tracking the inspections. Ms. Liem indicated that if the purpose is for tracking
then it is acceptable. Ms. Liem stated that EPA wants QA reports to go directly to the Study
Director and Study Director's management but if there if an alternate system at the sponsor QA
then EPA will judge acceptability based on how quickly the report gets to the Study Director.

<B><I> QUESTION 19: </I> Does EPA feel that study inspection reports must be submitted to
the Study Director and testing facility management simultaneously if there is a system in place
(e.g., signatures of both on inspection report or corresponding cover letter) to document that they
have both reviewed the report? What if there is no such system in place but the report or cover
letter includes a review routing request?</B><P>
 <B><I> ANSWER 19:</I></B>  It is EPA's opinion that the Study Director and Study
Director's management need to have separate copies of inspections and that the inspection
reports cannot be routed to management through the Study Director.  The audience members
offered several reasons why the routing procedures were preferred (e.g.,  management knows
issues were addressed by Study Director). It appeared that EPA's greatest concern was that
reports with problems (especially if related to the Study Director not fulfilling responsibilities)
would sit on the Study Director's desk rather than being routed in a timely manner. The audience
members assured Dr. Dull that any problems likely to affect the study integrity are reported by
QA immediately to the Study Director and management (per 40 CFR Part 160.35). The
discussion was eventually dropped without agreement on the issue. Dr. Dull indicated that
further dialog may be necessary.<P>

both the principal investigator and QA, does this meet the requirement of 40 CFR Part 160.35
which requires QA to maintain a copy of the protocol? Also, how about archiving if the QA and
study archives are in the same location?</B><P>
 <B><I> ANSWER 20: </I></B> The acceptability of this situation depends upon who has
possession of the protocol. As long as QA maintains the protocol per 160.35, this practice is
acceptable and the protocol can be shared (e.g., PI, study personnel). This would be judged on a
case by case basis (e.g., is the protocol in QA files).<P>

be used to ensure compliance and still remain in business (e.g., contract facility where QA owns
or helps run the company)? Also, does this interpretation only relate to the "Study Director's
management" or to the management of the various contracted facilities involved in the
study?</B><P>
 <B><I> ANSWER 21: </I></B> EPA cannot dictate how to run a company. It is up to each
company regarding who will do QA. As long as QA has someone to report to, the system is
acceptable (i.e., QA can be on the Board of Directors as long as QA reports to a person who is

distribution, is there a required standard for compliance? Since certified copies of raw data can

<hr>
<p>

</b><p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     I have reviewed the points that you expressed in your letter to Willa Garner dated
November 16,
1988.  Please note that the responses below reflect current Agency policy in these areas.<p>

<p>

     <u>1.  Solubility</u><p>

<p>

     As you pointed out, section 160.135 of the 1987 proposed IFRA Good Laboratory
Practice (GLP)
standards does not distinguish between organic solvent and water solubility studies.  Since there
is no distinction in the regulations, you must assume that any solubility study, including organic
solvent solubility, is subject to the full regulations.<p>

<p>

     <u>2.  Identification of Impurities</u><p>

<p>

     Section 160.105(a) of the GLPs require adequate test, reference, and control substance
characterization to be performed and documented <u>before</u> study initiation.  "Adequate"
characterization, e.g., specific level of impurities, is study-specific and hence not defined further
in the GLPs.  It is appropriate to consult with the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) to
determine if there are characterization requirements beyond those that your laboratory believes
are sufficient.  A decision to reject a study may be made by OPP independently of GLP
compliance.  Documentation as to when the levels of impurities were identified should be
included in your submission to OPP.<p>

<p>

     <u>3.  Computer Validation of Analytical Results</u><p>

<p>

     Design and use of an automated data collection system falls under GLPs if the system is
used in
the generation of raw data as defined in 160.3 and/or in the conduct of the study as addressed
in 160.130(e).  In such cases, the equipment must be of "appropriate design" and adequate
capacity" as specified in 160.61, and be "adequately tested, calibrated and/or standardized, "
maintained, and records kept for, as specified in 160.63.  Written SOPs are required for this
equipment.  No distinction is made between the automated data collection equipment and other
analytical instrumentation, so the same standards must be interpreted to apply to both.<p>

<p>

     As long as the data capture system meets these criteria, there is latitude in its design. 
Again, the
testing facility will be expected to provide documentation in the form of SOPs and other written
records to support the validity of the system however it is designed.<p>

<p>

     I hope this provides adequate clarification to enable you to proceed with the development
of
your GLP compliance plan.  Should you have further questions about these or other GLP
concerns,
please contact me.<p>

<p>

                                   Sincerely,  Phyllis E. Flaherty<p>

Keywords: Exploratory studies, Master Schedule, Sample retention<p>
<hr>
</b><p>

Dear  Dr.<p>

<p>

     This is in reply to your October 26, 1989 letter to David Dull as a follow-up to an October
2
meeting at EPA. Your letter was referred to my office for reply.  In your letter you listed several
points
regarding the interpretation of the Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs).  I have listed the
four
points presented in your letter and followed each with a response.<p>

<p>

     1.   Basic exploratory studies are those involved in method development, such as the
development and validation of analytical methods.<p>

<p>

     Response:  The term "exploratory studies" does not have the regulatory meaning as
suggested.  Certain method development and validation studies could be exploratory, but others
may
be required in support of registrations.  Also, some exploratory studies may have nothing to do
with
method development.  Basically, studies being performed for submission to EPA should be
regarded
as being subject to the GLPs, while studies performed entirely for internal use would not require
compliance.<p>

<p>

     2.   Master schedule sheets are maintained by the quality assurance units of the testing
facilities as a record of all studies conducted at the facilities.  The main purpose of
these sheets is to facilitate audits by EPA or FDA.<p>

<p>

     Response:  Master schedule sheets are required by the regulations as described.  However,
we do not believe that your statement is accurate in describing the main purpose of the master
schedule as facilitating audits by the Agency.  EPA uses the master schedule to determine the
adequacy of the testing facility, i.e., whether the facility is sufficient size and has sufficient
personnel
to perform the studies that are listed.  Finally, the master schedule is presumed to be necessary to
the testing facility itself, e.g., for use by the QAU to assist in tracking of studies and scheduling of
internal audits.<p>

<p>

     3.   Retention of records and samples is largely dictated by the study protocol.  In
metabolism studies only the major metabolites need be retained as reference sample. 
Samples analyzed during stability studies need not be retained.<p>

<p>

     Response:  Retention of records and samples is required by the regulations, which cannot
be superseded by the protocol.  The protocol will largely determine what records and samples are
generated during the course of the study, and all such raw data must be retained.  The GLPs do
allow that certain samples need not be retained longer than they afford evaluation, and that certain
specimens need not be retained after quality assurance verification (sections 160.195(c) and
792.195(c)).  These provisions are made to allow the discarding of certain samples or specimens
whose retention would not provide useful data integrity assurance.<p>

<p>

     4.   GLPs do not apply to routine manufacture or to starting materials used.<p>

<p>

     Response:  this is true where such processes are not performed as studies intended for
submission to EPA. Should the submission of such data be required by EPA, it would be subject
to
the regulations.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter dated October 19, 1989 to David Dull.  That letter was
referred to my office for response.  In your letter you requested clarification on the flowing two
points
regarding the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory 
Practice
standards (GLPs) and the Toxic substances control act (TSCA) GLPs.  Your questions concerned
the need for quality assurance unit inspections as required at 40 CFR 160.35(b) (FIFRA GLPs)
and
40 CFR 792.35(b) (TSCA GLPs).  Specifically, you asked whether the preamble discussions to
the
August 17, 1989 publications of these rules stating that each study must be inspected at least once
excluded the possibility of "interval inspections" as allowed by FDA and how this related to
screening
pilot and range-finding studies.  You also asked what would be considered appropriate to review
short-term repetitive studies if random inspection  programs are considered inappropriate.  We
have
reviewed your questions and offer the following guidance.<p>

<p>

     The GLPs state in sections 160.35(b) and 792..35(b) that the QAU "inspect each study at
intervals adequate to ensure the integrity of the study".  While this does not specify the number of
intervals we believe that in any case where a study is not inspected, i.e. at least once, there is a
clear GLP violation.  Our preamble statement concerning random inspections was directed at the
concept of allowing random selection of some studies for inspection, instead of inspecting all
studies.  For the reasons already stated, we do not believe that the regulations allow this.<p>

<p>

     Finally, we do not view range-finding pilot or screening studies as requiring GLP
compliance
unless they are being performed either as a study or as part of a study (i.e., specified in the
protocol
of a study) that is to be submitted to EPA.  There is no specific regulatory requirement that each
pilot, etc., study performed as part of a larger study be inspected by the QAU as long as each
larger
study is inspected as required.  The QAU may find it necessary to inspect some pilot, etc., studies
to assure the integrity of data from these portions of the studies.<p>

to my office for response.  In that letter, you requested clarification on the following issues related
to Good
Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs) under the federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
act
(FIFRA) at 40 CFR Part 160.  I have listed your questions and followed each by a response.<p>

<p>

     1.   Does GLP cover only the quality and integrity of study data generated and not the
science
of the study?<p>

<p>

     Response:  GLPs are primarily intended to ensure data quality and integrity.  Insofar as
scientific
methodologies affect this, e.g. instrument calibration, test article characterization, etc., they are
subject
to the GLPs.  Also, a GLP violation would occur if a protocol was not followed.  Please note that
EPA has
regulations and guidelines besides GLPs which determine what studies are required and how such
studies are to be conducted.<p>

<p>

     2.   In relation to multiple study locations, can a study director be designated for
individual
locations?  Also, can a single study director be designated for multiple locations?<p>

<p>

     Response:  The GLPs state at section 160.33 that the study director represents the single
point
of study control.  The GLPs also define the term study as an experiment conducted "at one or
more
locations."  We interpret this as meaning that no more than one study director shall be assigned to
a
given study, and that study director may, by definition, be responsible for more than one location
of
experimental work.  Testing facility management is still responsible to assure that adequate
personnel
are available at all locations, as stated at section 160.31(e).  <p>

<p>

     3.   When contracting field residue studies, can the sponsor define the contractor's
location as
a facility?<p>

<p>

     Response:  The GLPs define the testing facility as "the person who actually conducts the
study". 
This includes a contractor who performs the experimental work involved in the study.  Please
note that
the term "testing facility" will include more than one physical location, if the study is performed at
multiple
locations.  It will also include more than one organizational unit if more than one organizational
unit is
involved in the study's conduct.<p>

<p>

     4.   Will it be necessary to submit copies of individual field trial notebooks as part of a
multiple
trial data submission, or may summaries of raw data on test conditions for each location
be submitted?<p>

<p>

     Response:  Under GLPs, a summary and analysis of the raw data are required in the study
report
(section 160.185(a)(11)), but not a complete copy of raw data.  Program-specific guidelines that
indicate
a need for submission of raw data should be referenced to determine whether a copy of raw data,
i.e. field
records, is required in the report.  In any case, the original<p>

raw data would need to be archived at the completion of the study, and the location of the
archives listed
in the final report.<p>

<p>

<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of February 19, 1990.  In that letter, you requested a
waiver
of the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) requirements at 40 CFR part 160.105(c), which require
the
assignment of test substance storage containers for the duration of a study.  Your request is in
reference to a worker exposure study with<p>

<p>

     In your letter you stated that the study, conducted at 20 different sites throughout the
country,
would require about 1100 containers of the product, and that saving these for the 6-9 months of
the
study would present storage problems.  You also mentioned that all of the product used would be
from the same batch, with analysis of material done prior to study initiation.<p>

<p>

     EPA believes that the provision for assignment of storage containers for the duration of
the
study at 40 CFR 160.105(c) is a logical and necessary provision that in most cases provides
accountability of test material in a manner that imposes no unusual burden.  In this particular case,
however, the number of containers may pose unusual encumbrance problems.<p>

<p>

     Our staff has reviewed your request in light of the need to provide complete accountability
of test material and the potential burden involved in storing and accounting for 1100 containers in
twenty different locations.  It is our opinion that certain recordkeeping steps could provide a basis
for establishing an acceptable alternate method for the accounting of test substance storage
containers in lieu of actual storage of the containers for the duration of this study, and are willing
to
allow a conditional exception to this requirement.<p>

<p>

     This exception is applicable to the specific case of the approximately 1100 containers of
test substance used for the  worker exposure study  and is conditional
on the following:<p>

<p>

1) _________ shall assure the following records are maintained as raw data for this study: (a)
information of shipments pertaining to each container leaving the storage site (examples of
such records are shipping request records, bills of lading, carrier bills, and monthly
inventories of warehouse activity); (b) test article receipt records at each testing facility: (c)
complete use logs of material taken from containers; (d) a record of the final destination of
the container, including the place and date of disposal or reclaiming, and any appropriate
receipts.<p>

<p>

2)   A statement shall be included with the statement of compliance or noncompliance required
at 40 CFR 160.12 describing that this exception to Good Laboratory Practices is in
accordance with the conditions provided in this letter.<p>

<p>

3) _________ shall prepare an inventory of empty containers before disposal, including
sufficient information to uniquely identify containers, and shall maintain this inventory in an
up-to-date manner recording all arrivals of empty containers and their disposal..  This record
shall be maintained as raw data for this study.<p>

<p>

4) ________ shall identify the locations of facilities:  where test material is stored; where
empty containers are stored prior to disposal; where records of use, shipment, and disposal
of containers are maintained; and where the test substance is used in studies (i.e., testing
facility).  Within two weeks of receipt of notification of any pending inspection involving this
study, _________ shall report the location of each of these facilities to:<p>

          David Dull, Director<br>
          Laboratory Data Integrity Assurance Division<br>

          402 M street SW<br>
          Washington, DC 20460<br>

<p>

     Should these conditions not be fully met, all of the provisions of 40 CFR 160 (GLPs),
including assignment of storage containers for the duration of the study, apply.<p>

<p>

     In addition, ___________ is reminded that storage, disposal, or recycling of containers
must
be done in a manner pursuant to all applicable federal, state, county, or local laws.<p>

Keywords: Definitions, study, study director, residue studies, environmental fate studies<p>

<hr>
</b><p>

<p>
Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of February 22, 1990, to Steve Howie regarding
compliance
with federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice
standards
(GLPs).  In your letter you requested clarification regarding what may constitute a study under
GLPs.<p>

<p>

     You proposed that in residue and environmental fate studies that the field portions and
analytical laboratory portions of such studies be allowed to be considered as separate studies (i.e.,
analytical studies and field application studies) for the purpose of GLPs.  You pointed out that
there
would be practical benefits in localizing study control in terms of standard operating procedures
and
the responsibilities of the testing facility management, the study director, and the quality assurance
unit (QAU).  A study monitor at the sponsor facility would oversee the work performed by the
study
directors.  Finally, reports submitted to EPA would be formatted to comply with PR 86-5.<p>

<p>

     It is our belief that this approach does not meet GLP requirements.  The term "study," as
defined at 40 CFR 160.3, is an experiment "in which a test substance is studied in a test system ...
to determine or help predict its effects ..."  The coverage of portions of studies (analytical phases
or
field application phases) as complete and separate studies under this definition is problematic.<p>

<p>

     The term study director is defined as the individual responsible for the overall conduct of
the
study.  At 40 CFR 160.33, it is further explained that the study director is the single point in study
control and is responsible for the interpretation, analysis, documentation and reporting of results. 
This clearly indicates that a need is perceived for an individual who has overall responsibilities that
would encompass all technical aspects of a study.  When a study is submitted to EPA, it is
assumed
that there was one study director responsible for the overall conduct of the study.<p>

<p>

     Some technical difficulties arise from the breaking of studies into component parts
identified
separately as studies.  For example, there could be difficulty in assessing who has responsibility
during certain critical phases of studies, such as the transfer of sample material from application
sites following analysis, and the archiving of data.  The study directors of each unit of such a
subdivided study would also have the authority to account for protocol changes as provided in 40
CFR 160.120(b).  This would be expedient, but there would be a loss of assurance that such
changes conform to the overall purpose of the study.<p>

<p>

     Subdividing a study could also increase the overall burden associated with performing the
study.  It would be necessary to address the entire GLP standard from the viewpoint of each
subunit
that is described as a study.  For example, cooperators involved in application of agricultural
chemicals would have to address test substance characterization as required at 40 CFR 160.105
if the application work is a separate study.  Each time that a subunit exceeds 4 weeks duration,
the
affected contracting testing facility would also be responsible for assuring that a reserve sample of
the test substance is retained.  reporting requirements at 40 CFR 160.185 would have to be met
for
each unit.  And since EPA interprets 40 CFR 160.35(b) (3) to require a QAU inspection of each
study, each subdivision would require at least one QAU inspection.<p>

<p>

     It should be possible to accommodate entire field residue or environmental fate
experiments
as single studies under GLPs.  The testing facility that is involved in such studies would
encompass
all organizational entities involved in conducting the actual work.  Testing facility management
duties
may be predominantly assumed by the sponsor facility or by a lead contracting laboratory,
depending
on needs and capabilities.  Certain overall responsibilities, such as that of the study director to
assure that the study is conducted according to GLPs, must be centralized and cannot be
delegated. 
However, the study could be divided into units based on practical considerations, with many
technical details and the responsibility of monitoring these details delegated as is seen fit by
management.  Thus, study project directors, or other appropriately identified individuals, may be
responsible for assuring that day-to-day operations are carried out.<p>

<p>

     Please note that the testing facility management is responsible for designating the study
director and making the appropriate assurances as specified at 40 CFR 160.31 (e.g., that there is
a QAU, etc.).  The regulations do not state that the testing facility management actually performs
the
duties it is providing assurances for under this section; consequently, there is considerable
flexibility
for contracted persons to provide their own standard operating procedures, QAUs, or other
requirements, provided that the overall testing facility management (i.e., at the sponsor, or
perhaps
at the prime contractor) can provide assurance that compliance with GLPs occurred.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of March 14, 1990, to Dr. David Dull requesting
clarification
of the federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice
standards (GLPs) requirements involving field dissipation studies.  Specifically you asked me how
long soil, water, and plant samples analyzed for pesticide content as part of these studies need to
be retained.<p>

<p>

     The GLPs state at 40 CFR 160.190(a) that specimens of soil, water, and plants do not
need
to be retained after quality assurance verification.  The preamble to the rule published on August
17,
1989 (54 FR 34052) states that this means that such samples shall be retained until the quality
assurance unit assures that their discarding does not negatively impact the integrity of the study. 
Unless such assurance is provided, such samples must be retained for the period of time specified
under 40 CFR 160.195.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of March 15, 1990, in which you requested clarification
of
several points regarding the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) good
Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs).  Specifically, you stated that you believed that technical
work
performed at separate laboratories constitute separate studies which should each have their own
protocol, final report, and study director.  You stated that this is important to assure proper
oversight
of study activities.<p>

<p>

     This approach does not meet the GLP requirements.  The term "study", as defined at 40
CFR
160.3, is an experiment "in which a test substance is studied in a test system ... to determine or

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of December 1, 1989 to David Dull, requesting
information
concerning the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory
Practice standards (GLPs).  That letter was referred to my office for response.  Specifically, you
asked for clarification on the following four points:<p>

<p>

1.   What is the definition of "quality assurance verification" at 40 CFR 160.190(a)?  Can this
be
met through SOPs that are periodically inspected by the quality assurance unit (QAU)?<p>

<p>

2a.  Must the compliance statement required at 40 CFR 160.12 be one sheet, or can the
sponsor
and applicant sign one sheet, with the study director signing the overall report containing a
section on compliance?  Can there be separate statements, and are three signatures
required if the sponsor and applicant are the same?<p>

<p>

2b.  Can the sponsor sign the study report after the study director?<p>

<p>

3.   Since test substances, as defined at 40 CFR 160.3 include degradation products or
metabolites, is it necessary to include metabolites and reference substances to determine
metabolites to the protocol?<p>

<p>

     Our staff has examined your questions and offer the following clarifications.<p>

<p>

1.   In the August 17, 1989 GLP rule, 54 FR 34052, EPA clarified that quality assurance
verification means that the material needs to be retained until the QAU assures that its
discarding does not negatively affect the quality of the study.  This clearly implies that the
verification is a duty of the QAU, not the study personnel.  It is not appropriate for the QAU
to delegate its responsibilities to the personnel performing the study through SOPs or any
other mechanism.  Thus, the suggestion that verification be through SOPs periodically
checked by the QAU is unacceptable.<p>

<p>

2.a. EPA views the compliance statements as an important document, and does not believe
that
it fulfils its intended function unless it is signed by all parties as specified at 40 CFR 160.12. 
The regulations also specify at 40 CFR 160.185(b) that the study director must sign and date
the study report.  While it is clear that the regulations intend that both the compliance
statement and the study report be signed by the study director, this could be accomplished
by including the compliance statement on the same page of the final report that the study
director signs.<p>

<p>

     Regarding those situations where the sponsor and applicant are the same person, that
person need sign only once, provided that person is clearly identified on the compliance
statement as both sponsor and applicant.<p>

<p>

     In response to your question on whether the individuals signing the compliance statement
may sign separate copies, the answer is yes.  Where the sponsor, applicant, or study director
sign separate copies of the compliance statement, each copy must be identical in content
and must be included in the study report with the appropriate signature.<p>

<p>

2.b. The purpose of the study director's signature is to assure accountability for the contents of
the final report.  Thus, any amendments to the final report that reflect work that the study
director is accountable for require the study director's signature.  However, EPA has clarified,
at 160.185(c), that reformatting or other modifications to conform with EPA's submission
requirements (e.g., to conform with PR Notice 86-5) do not constitute amendments that
require study director signature.  Insofar as the sponsor-signed items included in the final
report do not constitute products intrinsically related to the performance of the study, EPA
sees no reason to require that the submission of the report be delayed to acquire the study
director's signature.  Such contents should be clearly identified as non-data items, and the
signature should be clearly identified as the sponsor signature.<p>

<p>

3.   The term "test substance", as defined in section 160.2, does include any degradation
product
or metabolite which is used in a study to assist in characterizing the toxicity, metabolism or
other characteristics of a substance that is the subject of an application for a research or
marketing permit.  However, in the case that determining metabolites or degradation
products is the stated objective of the study, such determination constitutes the characteristic
that is being determined.  Thus, in such a study metabolites or degradation products do not
constitute the test substance.  However, any reference substances intended to characterize
such metabolites and degradation products should be identified in the protocol, by
amendment if necessary.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of February 9, 1990, to David Dull of the Laboratory
Data
Integrity Assurance Division.  In your letter you requested clarification concerning the application
of
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice
(GLP)
standards during the preparation and transmission of test substances to be used in studies
performed under GLP's.<p>

<p>

     The FIFRA GLP standards are intended to provide assurance that laboratory conduct
during
the performance of studies to be submitted to EPA is such that it does not jeopardize the integrity
of the data generated.  At 40 CFR 160.105, the GLPs specify that there must be determinations of
the identity, purity, strength, composition, or other appropriate characteristics of test, control, or
reference substance before its use in a study.  Since these determinations must be made in the
direct context of the use of the material in the study, they are part of study performance and must
comply with GLPs.  Further, there are provisions at 40 CFR 160.107 that procedures assuring
proper
storage, distribution, identification, and receipt of the test, control, and reference substances be
followed.  This includes handling and after the time that the substance is characterized.<p>

<p>

     However, the methods of synthesis, fabrication, or derivation of the test, control, or
reference
substance need only be documented before the start of the study, and the location of
documentation
specified.  The actual synthesis, fabrication, or derivation need not be performed under GLPs.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of February 26, 1990, to Steve Howie of my staff.  In
that
letter, you requested guidance regarding EPA's interpretation of the Federal insecticide,
Fungicide,
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs) in regard to field
residue
studies.  Specifically, you asked if weather data and soil analyses required GLP compliance when
used to support GLP studies, and what statement of compliance would be required when State,
Federal, or independent laboratories are used for residue studies.<p>

<p>

     Any study performed in support of a FIFRA research or marketing permit must be in
accordance with applicable GLP standards.  If soil analyses or weather measurements are made
as part of such a study, they must comply with the GLPs.  In the case that non-study information
is
referenced, e.g., local weather data, the data generation need not be under GLPs as long as it is
clear that a reference to such data is being made.  Finally, the statement of compliance or
noncompliance is necessary regardless of the affiliation(s) of testing laboratories employed in the
study.<p>

<p>

<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of January 18, 1990, requesting clarification of your
obligations regarding archiving of raw data.  In your letter you stated that you are a contract
laboratory, and that many of your clients prefer to archive original data generated by you.  You
asked
whether you were required to archive authenticated copies.  You explained that, due to the large
amount of data often generated, it becomes difficult to archive data immediately at the completion
of a study, and you asked whether it would be acceptable to archive within 30 days of report
completion.<p>

<p>

     Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory
Practice standards (GLPs), there must be archives for orderly storage and expedient retrieval of
all
raw data, documentation, protocols, specimens, and interim and final reports (40 CFR
160.190(b)).
Further, the study director is required to assure that all such records are transferred to the
archives
during or at the close of the study (40 CFR 160.33(f)).  This ensures that data are fully accounted
for at the completion of the study.  This must be completed prior to the signing of the compliance
statement by the study director.<p>

<p>

     There is flexibility in the location of the archives of raw data and specimens.  At 40 CFR
160.190(b), the GLPs state that retention of records at alternate locations is acceptable, provided
that there is specific reference to those locations in the archives.  Such off-location archives must
still meet the full requirements of 40 CFR 160.190.  Whether records are archived at the
registrant's
facility, at a contactor's central location, or at separate contractors' locations, the study director
must
assure that all raw data and specimens have been achieved before the study report is signed. If the
study director cannot assure that records at a particular location are archived correctly, he cannot
sign a compliance statement that indicates that this standard has been met.<p>

<p>

     The sponsor is ultimately responsible for the raw data supporting the study (40 CFR
169.2(k))
and may require archived records to be shipped to the sponsor's archives at some date following
a study.  Alternatively, a testing facility may wish to consolidate archives at one location during or
after a study.  Such transfers of archives do not present a problem if the records are properly
accounted for and the testing facility maintains records of the archive location(s) at all times.<p>

<p>
Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in reply to your letter of March 21, 1990, in which you requested clarification
regarding
the Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs).  Specifically, you requested guidance regarding
Quality Assurance Unit (QAU) inspections, and what inspectional frequency would be considered
to be "adequate to insure the integrity of the study, "when a study involves multiple sites, narrow
crop
windows, and field cooperators that have no QAU's.  Since your letter referenced field studies and
crops, this reply is being made in the context of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA) GLPs.<p>

<p>

     The GLPs state at 40 CFR 160.35(a) that a testing facility shall have a QAU that shall
monitor
each study to assure management that the facilities, equipment, personnel, methods, practices,
records, and controls are in conformance with the GLPs. The GLPs further state that 40 CFR
160.35(b)(3) that the QAU shall inspect each study at intervals adequate to ensure that integrity
of
the study.<p>

<p>

     Clearly, the QAU must conduct inspections adequate to provide the assurances required at
40 CFR 160.35(a) and, in the course of so doing, must inspect each study at least once.  All
parameters must be verified adequate for each site, but it is acceptable to use inspections
conducted during other studies to provide necessary assurances.  It is also acceptable to use
inspections conducted when no study is in progress to assure that methods, personnel, etc. at a
particular site are in conformance with GLPs.  However, acceptability of such inspections is
contingent on assuring that the facilities, personnel, methods, etc., which are inspected are
representative of those used in the study.  Please note that it is necessary to reinspect facilities
periodically to account for changes in personnel, equipment, etc.<p>

<p>

     Finally, no matter ho complete QAU inspectional coverage is regarding the sites involved
in
a study, it is still necessary to conduct at least one inspection of study activities while the study is
in progress.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of May 17, 1990, to Dr. David Dull, in which you asked
for
clarification regarding the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs).  Your letter was referred to my office for response.<p>

<p>

     Specifically, you asked whether GLP compliance is required of an independent
confirmatory
method trial performed to gather data for a petition involving new analytical methods for
determining
pesticide residues in agricultural commodities or processed foods.  You further asked for
guidance
for determining the point at which basic exploratory work may develop into a study that must be
performed under GLP compliance.<p>

<p>

     The scope of the FIFRA GLP requirements covers studies conducted to support tolerance
petitions.  As such, the confirmatory method trials fall under the scope of GLP requirements.<p>

<p>

     The FIFRA GLPs are explicit in stating that "basic exploratory studies carried out to
determine
whether a test substance or test method has any potential utility" do not fall under the definition of
"study" and consequently are not under GLPs.  Confirmatory method trials are not basic
exploratory
studies since it is assumed that their potential utility has been established by the time that such
trials
are performed.<p>

<p>

     General guidance regarding the point at which an "exploratory" study should be regarded
as
potentially requiring GLP compliance is provided directly by the GLP regulation.  At 40 CFR
160.1
the standards state that GLPs are prescribed for the conduct of studies "intended to support
applications for research or marketing permits..."  Thus, at any time where it is known that study
data
are intended to be submitted to EPA under the scope and definition given in the regulation, that
study must be performed according to GLPs.  However, we would advise that at any time that it
is
known that the data from  a study <u>may</u> be submitted to EPA under the scope and
definition given in
the regulation, that study should also be conducted according to GLPs.  Such data, if later
reported
to EPA, would be required to be accompanied by a valid compliance statement.  The data
submission may be rejected if the compliance statement indicates GLPs were not followed
regardless of whether the data were intended for submission to EPA at the time that the study was
performed.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of May 14, 1990, to Mr. A.E. Contory II in which you
requested an opinion regarding the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs).  Your letter was referred to me for reply.<p>

<p>

     Specifically, you requested clarification regarding the duties of the quality assurance unit
(QAU) and the study director under GLPs in the situation where contract laboratories are
cooperating
on studies.  You suggested that a study director employed by a competitor with whom you are
cooperating on a GLP study would be in a position to gain access to confidential business
information.  This would occur through QAU reports as required by GLPs and through
inspections
by such study director of your facilities.  You also suggested that practical difficulties that arise in
gaining timely approvals of procedure changes by off-site study directors, and that the involved
nature of field studies makes it impossible for one person to be completely responsible for such
duties.  You proposed that these problems could be solved by transferring study director
oversight
responsibilities to on-site principal investigators.<p>

<p>

     The GLPs require at 40 CFR 160.35(b)(3) that the QAU bring to the attention of the
study
director and management any problems which are likely to affect the integrity of the study.  At 40
CFR 160.35(b)(4), the QAU is further required to submit written status reports to the study
director,
noting problems and corrective actions.  Since these reports need only contain study-performance
information, our office does not believe that they involve confidentiality issues, and thus must be
submitted to the study director as required.<p>

     <p>

     The GLPs do require at 40 CFR 160.33 that there be one study director to provide
assurance
that certain tasks are properly performed.  As you pointed out, the study director must authorize
deviations in standard operating procedures and must sign protocol revisions.  While such
approvals
should be done as early as possible, conduct of the study is not required to cease before the
approval action.  Consequently, these requirements are not in conflict with having an off-site
study
director.  Further, the study director has no explicit site-inspection duties under the GLPs.  While
the
study director must maintain overall responsibility, delegation of the practical oversight of
technical
efforts is not prohibited by the regulations.  This allows necessary  technical duties to be assigned
to on-site individuals (e.g., to principal investigators) and should relieve your concerns regarding
the
presence of persons who may be security risks.  Please note that the study director must sign the
compliance statement for the study.<p>

<p>

     It is our opinion that there is no inherent conflict with GLPs when more one contracting
facility
and/or location is involved in a study.  If you have any questions concerning this response, please
contact Steve Howie of my staff at (202) 475-7786.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter dated November 21, 1988.  In that letter, you requested a
reply concerning the need for reserve sample retention requirements under 40 CFR 160.105(d),
assuming the nature of the study is chemical analysis.  Specifically, you asked about the effect on
compliance of factors that cause actual study duration to differ from the originally planned
duration.<p>

<p>

     Neither the 1983 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards nor the 1987 proposed revisions suggest that study duration
is anything but the actual time that the study takes.  If a study is of more than 4 weeks actual
duration, it would be required to have reserve samples taken under 40 CFR 105(d) provided the
type
of test is subject to that section.  Unforeseen circumstances that increase the length of time that a
study takes may affect whether a reserve sample is needed.<p>

<p>

     The requirements is for a reserve sample to be retained from each batch of test and control
substance.  A retention sample need not be taken from each subquantity supplied to the testing
facility for each study.  It may be taken from a different subquantity of the same batch, and taken
after the beginning of a study, as long as it is retained for the period of time provided in 40 CFR
160.195.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

This is in response to your letter dated March 24, 1989, concerning  FIFRA Good Laboratory
Practice
(GLP) standards (40 CFR part 160).  In that letter you requested clarification of the proposed rule
regarding routine laboratory analyses by contracted testing facilities.  Specifically, you requested
clarification as to whether the existence of a client's internal study officer and quality assurance
unit
(QAU) would obviate the need for the duplication of such personnel at contract facilities.<p>

<p>

     The proposed rule has not yet been published as a final rule.  It is not appropriate for our
office to issue a formal clarification of the proposed amendments until they are published as a final
rule in the Federal Register.  Your comments must therefore be addressed in the context of the
current rule, which was published in 1983.  Our staff has reviewed your comments and offers the
following clarification,  based on the current rule.<p>

<p>

     The responsibilities of the study director and AQU include assurance that the performance
of a study complies with GLP standards.  Their duties include on-site inspection and monitoring
of
study operations.  These activities could be adequately conducted by a client-maintained study
director and QAU that are located off-site, if provisions are made to ensure that all required
on-site
duties are performed.<p>

<p>

     Compliance with GLPs is a responsibility of the testing facility as well as of the registrant. 
This is true whether the testing facility is contracted for a portion or for the entirety of the
technical
effort of a GLP study.  The contract testing facility must therefore ensure adequate oversight of
study
conduct and quality assurance activities.  While adequate standard operating procedures must also
be maintained at the contract laboratory, the existence of these would not be sufficient in
themselves
to ensure GLP compliance.<p>

<p>

<p>

     If you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie, of my
staff,
at (202) 382-7825.  Should you require further written clarification of this matter following
publication
of the final rule amending the FIFRA GLP standards, please write us again.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     Your letter of March 13, 1990, to Dr. David Dull regarding study design under the
Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice standards (GLPs)
was
referred to my office for response.<p>

<p>

     Specifically, you asked about what you consider to be a contradiction between Standard
Evaluation Procedures (SEP) for Terrestrial Field Dissipation studies and the GLPs.  The SEP in
question states that the report should contain: 1) a stated goal of the study; and 2) sufficient
information on the test protocol and the analytical protocol.  You suggested that since separate
protocols are mentioned in the SEP for the test and the analysis, that these should be allowed to
be
separate studies under GLPs.<p>

<p>

     Your suggested approach does not comply with the GLP requirements.  The GLPs define
a study as an experiment to determine or help predict the effects or characteristics of a test
substance.  The separate analytical phase of an experiment does not meet this criteria.  Further,
the
SEP that you cited refers to a single study and would itself be contradicted by breaking the
experimental effort into two separate studies.<p>

<p>

     The SEPs may be used to provide guidance for the performance of studies, but they do
not
supersede the requirements of the GLP regulations.  Should there be a terminology difference
between the GLPs and an SEP, the requirements of the GLPs take precedence.<p>

<p>

     To comply with GLPs, each study must have one protocol and one study director.  As
stated
in the GLPs, the protocol must contain but is not limited to the information stated at 40 CFR
160.120(a).  The separate test and analytical methodologies must be included or referenced in the
single protocol that covers the entire study.<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in response to your letter of March 2, 1990 to Phyllis Flaherty, of my staff.  In your
letter, you requested clarification regarding thirteen areas of concern that your notes from the
January 8, 1990 FIFRA GLP Workshop suggested were under review at the time, or would
require
follow-up.<p>

<p>

     Your questions covered programmatic issues, such as scheduling of laboratory audits, and
policy issues, such as interpretation of the GLPs.  Our office has responded in writing to persons
asking questions concerning several of these issues.<p>

<p>

     I have enclosed copies of such letters that relate to the policy issues that you identified in
your letter, including: routine analyses (question 3 -________________; revision of policies
regarding
penalties (question 4 - ________________; subdivision of studies (question 5 - see _____ and
__________; timing of transfer to archives (question 8 - see _________; and documentation of
caricaturization (question 13 - _________.  The issue of test article container assignment has been
handled on a case-by-case basis (question 9 - see ________).<p>

<p>

     The other policy issues that you identified in your letter are still under review, and may be
addressed in a question-and-answer document that our office is currently preparing.  If you have
any
questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my staff at (202)
475-7786.<p>

<p>

                                   Sincerely yours,<p>

<p>

<b>Date:  <u>26 Sept 1990</u> --- EPA Advisory # <u>  20 </u><p>

Keywords: Multiple Study Directors<p>

<hr>
</b><p>

<p>

Dear<p>

<p>

     This is in reply to your letter of April 11, 1990, in which you requested comments
concerning
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice standards
(GLPs).  Specifically, your letter dealt with the difficulty of assigning a single study director to
one
research project, as required at 40 CFR 160.33.<p>

<p>

     According to your letter, the _______ conducts approximately 200 research projects
annually
to support minor uses of pesticides.  The work on a given project may be performed at several
different field and/or laboratory sites, each with its own management unit.  While the _________
coordinates all research, it does not have direct technical control of the performance of work at
any
of the field or laboratory sites.  You proposed that we accept a "multi-study director" concept
that
defines each field trial at each location with a single pesticide/commodity as a study.  You would
further define the analytical phase of each project as a separate study.<p>

<p>

     I believe that the _________; could meet the requirements of a Study Director, and we
need
to explore this option rather than the multi-Study Director system that you have suggested.  The
latter would require reproposing and amending the GLP regulations and would, in my view,
compromise one of the primary tenets of the current regulations, accountability.<p>

<p>

     The requirement at 40 CFR 160.33 states that the study director represents the single
point
of study control, and is responsible for the overall conducting of the study.  Dividing a technical
effort
into multiple studies creates multiple points of control, and means that there is no individual with
overall responsibility.  The accountability provided by a single study director (who plans,
oversees,
and controls the interpretation, analysis, documentation, and reporting of the results) is one of the
most important aspects of the GLP standards.  In addition, the regulations define a study as a
complete experimental effort.  Separate phases whether by location or type of work performed
(i.e.
analytical versus field) do not constitute separate studies under the current regulations.<p>

<p>

     I would see with ________ a single study director who takes overall responsibility for
assuring
the adequate completion of the entire research project, but who need not be directly involved in
performance of each technical effort.  Thus, for projects coordinated by ___, the study director
would
oversee the performance of non-site technical directors (or assistant study directors) who are
responsible for the individuals carrying out field and analytical duties.<p>

<p>

     I believe that we can resolve these issues, as you suggest, with a meeting.  The Office of
Pesticide Programs (OPP) has also expressed an interest in such a meeting.  I understand that you
also have several technical questions regrading the GLPs, and I would be willing to discuss these
at our meeting.  If you would please contact me at your earliest convenience, we can arrange a
suitable time and place; I will coordinate with the appropriate OPP staff.  I can be reached at
202-382-7825.<p>

<p>

Sincerely yours,<p>

<b>Date:  <u>3 June 1993</u> ---   EPA Advisory # <u>  61 </u><p>

Keywords: Wet specimen retention, sample storage<p>

</b><hr>
<p>

Dear<p>

This is in reply to your letter of April 14, 1993, to Dr. David Dull of the Laboratory Data
Integrity Assurance Division.  Your letter referred to the requirements of the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice
Standards (GLPS), and was directed to my office for response.<p>

In your letter you requested clarification regarding the need to retain wet specimens
under the GLP regulations.  Specifically, you were interested in knowing retention
requirements for wet samples of biological tissue from microcosm/mesocosm studies. 
According to your letter, your facility stores such samples in formalin solution in vials
which cannot be sufficiently sealed to prevent evaporation.  This necessitates periodic
checks to replace evaporation losses so that samples do not deteriorate.  You stated
that auditors from the Environmental Protection Agency had suggested that it may be
permissible for you to discard the samples following quality assurance verification as
provided at 40 CFR 160.195(c).<p>

The FIFRA GLPS at 40 CFR 160.195(c) specifically state that "[w]et specimens...and
specially prepared material which are relatively fragile and differ markedly in stability
and quality during storage shall be retained only as long as the quality of the
preparation affords evaluation."  This provision does not appear to generally apply in
your case.  While you did mention a problem inherent to sample retention, you also
mentioned that your archiving procedures accounted for this through periodic checks
and replenishment of evaporated material.  Presumably, when such specimens are
archived under your procedures they continue to afford evaluation indefinitely.<p>

The same provision of the regulations also provides that "[s]pecimens of mutagenicity
tests, specimens of soil, water, and plants, and wet specimens of blood, urine, feces,
and biological fluids, do not need to be retained after quality assurance verification." 
While this provision clearly allows plant tissues to be discarded after quality assurance
verification, it does not provide a similar allowance for animal tissues.  Presuming that
the tissue samples you are dealing with are of animal origin, this provision would not
allow for their disposal.<p>

Consequently, under the provisions given at 40 CFR 160.195(c), you are required to
maintain your samples as long as they afford evaluation.  Should you find that the
samples you are keeping no longer afford evaluation, i.e., because of deterioration, the
provisions at 40 CFR 160.195(c) become effective and you may discard them. 
However, you are cautioned that the regulations state at 40 CFR 160.190(b) that the
conditions of storage of specimens must minimize  their deterioration in accordance
with the nature of the specimens.  Thus, if samples should deteriorate as a result of
improper archiving, this would itself indicate a violation of the regulations.<p>

Finally, please note that 40 CFR 160-195(h) does allow for specific samples to be
discarded after notification by EPA that such samples are no longer required.  This is
allowed only on a case-by-case basis and generally provides that such samples may
be discarded after an EPA or FDA audit has confirmed that the study they pertain to
was conducted in accordance with FIFRA GLPS.<p>

If you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my
staff at (703) 308-8290.<p>

Sincerely yours,   <p>
<p>
John J. Neylan III<p>

Keywords: Test Substance storage, use, temperature monitoring<p>

</b><hr>
<p>

Dear<p>

This is in response to your letter of January 22, 1993, to Dr. David Dull, in which you
requested clarification of guidelines concerning retention of test substances.  You
stated that several questions had arisen concerning disposition of empty test material
containers and the use of surplus test substance.  Your letter was referred to my office
for reply.<p>

Specifically, you asked three questions: (1) Can surplus test material and test
substance containers be returned to the sponsor or to your permanent facility or must
they remain on site until the completion of the study?  (2) After completion of the field
portion of the study, or upon completion of the entire study, can surplus test substances
be utilized elsewhere?  (3) Is storage data (temperature, etc.) required for surplus test
substances after completion of the field portion of a study?  Although not stated in your
letter, Steve Howie, of my staff verified during a telephone conversation with you on
February 17 that your request for clarification was in reference to the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice
Standards (GLPS) at 40 CFR Part 160.<p>

Under GLPS, test substance containers must be retained for the duration of a study. 
This is necessary to comply with the provisions of 40 CFR 160.105(c), which states in
part that "...Storage containers shall be assigned to a particular test substance for the
duration of the study."  To comply with this, the test substance storage containers must
be kept until the study is completed.  Note that it is not necessary for these containers
to be kept at a particular location, except that they must be available for inspection
upon request.  It would be necessary to maintain records of the location of the
containers if such containers are not kept at the testing site or facility.<p>

Surplus test substance which is left over from a study need not be retained until the
study is over.  It may instead be used for other purposes.  If the product is a registered
pesticide, it may be disposed of by use in a manner consistent with its labelling, or by
appropriate disposal in accordance with applicable labelling and local, State and
Federal laws.  However, it is necessary in any event that the receipt and distribution
(including use or disposal) be documented, as is required at 40 CFR 160.107.  It is also
necessary, in the case of a study of more than 4 weeks duration, to assure that a
reserve sample of each batch of the test, control, and reference substance is retained
as required at 40 CFR 160.105(d).  Note that these samples must be retained for the
period of time given at 40 CFR 160.195.  Note that any test substance storage
container which held test substance actually used in a study must be retained until the
study ends; if surplus material in the container is used for other purposes or disposed
of, the container must still be retained.<p>

Finally, with one exception, once material is no longer needed for a study, it is not
necessary to assure its continued physical integrity (i.e., temperature logs, etc.). The
exception would be in the case of the reserve sample retained for a study of greater
than 4 weeks duration.  Such samples must be stored in archives under conditions
which minimize deterioration, as stated at 40 CFR 160.190(b).  Documentation such as
temperature logs or other records must be kept as necessary to support the claim that
the archives were in compliance with this section.<p>

Dear<p>

This is in reply to your letters of May 21, 1993, and June 6,1993, in which you
requested a waiver for certain requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPs).<p>

Specifically you requested that the retention requirement for test substance storage
containers, as provided at 40 CFR 160.105(c), be waived with respect to a study
identified by the code #934110 which you are preforming.  The study in question is a
drift and worker exposure study which your company is conducting for the sponsors,
_______.<p>

<p>

You stated in your letters that the reason you asked for a waiver resulted from the
nature of the containers involved in the study.  The containers in question are large
steel cylinders, with weight capacity from 250 to 1500 pounds which are refilled with
methyl bromide after each fumigation application.  The canisters need to be available
for refilling for other applications throughout California and other states.  Retaining the
canisters would require storage of hundreds of containers and would create a hardship
on the applicator companies as their supply of containers would soon be depleted for
future use.<p>

In your July 6, 1993 letter you further described the trial as starting sometime in July,
1993 and ending in October, 19____ in Santa Barbara County.  Your letter indicated
the amount to be applied was up to 300 pounds per acre of the 98% formulated
material, within one trial on a ten acre plot.<p>

EPA believes that the provision for assignment of storage containers for the duration of
the study at 40 CFR 105(c) is a logical and necessary standard.  In most cases this
provision provides accountability of test material in a manner that imposes no unusual
burden.  In this particular case we agree that the number and type of containers may
pose unusual problems.<p>

Our staff has reviewed this request and proposal in vies of the need to provide
complete accountability for the test material and the potential burden involved in storing
and accounting for the number of containers mentioned.  It is our opinion that certain
record keeping steps could provide a basis for establishing an acceptable alternate
method for the accounting of test substance storage containers in lieu of actual storage
of containers for the duration of this study.  We are willing to allow Siemer and
Associates a conditional exception to this requirement.<p>

This exception is applicable to the study that you cited in your letter and described
above (#934110) and is conditional on the following:<p>

1.  _______ shall assure the following records are maintained as raw
data for this study: () information of shipments pertaining to each container leaving the
storage site (example of such records are shipping requests records, bills of lading,
carrier bills, and monthly inventories of warehouse activity); (b) test article receipt
records at each testing facility; (c) complete use logs of material taken from containers;
and (d) a record of the final destination of the container including the place and date of
disposal or reclaiming and approximate receipts.<p>

<p>

2.  A statement shall be included with the statement of compliance or non-compliance
for study # 934110 required at 40 CFR 160.12 describing that this exception to FIFRA
Good Laboratory Practices is in accordance with the conditions provided in this letter.<p>

3.  If disposal of containers occurs, _____________ will prepare an inventory of
empty containers before disposal, including sufficient information to uniquely identify
containers, and shall maintain this inventory in an up-to-date manner, recording all
arrivals of empty containers and their disposal.  This record shall be maintained as raw
data for this study.<p>

4.  _______________ shall identify the locations of facilities where test materials is
stored, where recycling of containers occurs, where empty containers are stored prior
to disposal or recycling, where records of use, shipment, and disposal/disposition of
containers are maintained, and where the test substance is used in studies (i.e. the
testing facility).<p>

Within two weeks of receipt of notification of any pending inspection involving this
study, __________________ shall report the location of each of these facilities to:<p>

<p>

Dear<p>

This is in reply to your letter of February 24, 1993, in which you requested clarification
regarding certain requirements under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  Specifically,
you requested clarification regarding characterization requirements under 40 CFR
160.105 for radio-labelled test substances.  You stated that your request came as a
result of past inspectional findings and a desire to ensure that your current practices
are in compliance with GLPS.<p>

Briefly summarized, you posed the following specific questions in your letter:<p>

1)  May characterizations be performed as separate studies from the multiple studies in
which the characterized substances will be used?<p>

2)  If such a characterization study is performed, must all provisions of GLP be
complied with, including the characterization which is the goal of the study?<p>

3)  Would the exceptions at 40 CFR 160.135(b) apply to such characterization studies?<p>

The characterization requirements at 40 CFR 160.105(a) must be met for each batch of
test, reference, or control substance prior to its use in a study.  It is acceptable for data
to be collected in characterization studies and used to support subsequent multiple
studies as asked in your first question.<p>

In reply to your second and third questions, the GLPS provide flexibility which prevent
the quandary of needing to fully characterize a substance before it can be used in a
study designed to collect that characterization data.  First, if a study is performed to
determine the characteristics required under 40 CFR 160.105(a) it qualifies as partially
exempt from the GLPS as provided at 40 CFR 160.135. As such, it does not need to
comply with the requirements of 160.31(d) and 160.105(a) through (d).  Alternatively,
if a study is performed to determine the characteristics require under 40 CFR
160.105(b), i.e., solubility and stability, it is not exempt under 40 CFR 160.135.  In this
case, the requirements of 40 CFR 160.105(b) provide sufficient flexibility to avoid the
need for redundant testing.  Solubility characterization need only be performed if
"relevant to the conduct of the study," which is clearly not the case for a study
conducted expressly to determine solubility.  On the other hand, stability
characterization is allowed to be met concomitantly through periodic analysis of each
batch.  This, by definition, is performed in the course of a study designed to determine
the stability of a batch of test substance.<p>

<p>

In summary, it is permissible to perform characterization studies as you described and
in certain cases partially exempt the work from GLP compliance as provided at 40 CFR
160.135.  It is not necessary to perform redundant characterizations of the tested
parameters.<p>

If you have any question concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my
staff at (703) 308-8290.<p>

Dear<p>

This is in response to your letters of March 18 and April 1, 1993, in which you
requested assistance in dealing with a problem that you believe exists in the Federal
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).<p>

In your March 18 letter you stated that GLP standards regarding characterization of test
substances and mixtures (40 CFR 160.105 and 160.113) are routinely not complied
with during acute toxicology studies.  As examples, you cited two types of acute studies
which cost, respectively, $5,000 - 5,500 and $1,300.  You claimed that analytical
chemistry could cost over $60,000, with 67% of this money spent on test article
mixtures and positive controls.<p>

You felt that these cost issues affect compliance with GLPS.  Further, you stated that
registrants "do not routinely" analyze positive controls or mixtures for acute studies,
and that though "everyone knows they are deviating" from compliance, it is not always
noted on the compliance statement.  You asked whether EPA would consider amending
GLPS to address these problems with respect to acute studies, and indicated that you
would be willing to meet with me to discuss the issues in more detail.  Although you did
not say what changes you would propose to make to the rule, such change would
presumably relieve acute studies of some of the characterization requirements.<p>

Your April 1 letter was written as a follow up to your March 18 letter.  In your April 1
letter you stated that you had further consulted with a chemistry contracting laboratory
and with Steve Howie, of my staff.  You stated that you believed that part of the
problem was the use of EPA product chemistry guidelines to provide characterization
data for toxicology studies.  You stated that a possible solution would be to allow
"pared down" versions of these guidelines for the purposes of characterization under
40 CFR 160.105 and 160.113.<p>

Also in your April 1 letter you inquired about a difference between the characterization
requirements of the FDA's regulations at 21 CFR 58.105(a) and the FIFRA GLPS at 40
CFR 160.105(a).  The FDA GLPS provide that marketed products which are used as
control articles may be characterized "by their labelling".  The EPA regulations contain
no such clause.<p>

The GLP requirements of 40 CFR 160.105 and 160.113 differ significantly from the
requirements for meeting product chemistry data requirements at 40 CFR 158.150 -
158.190 and the product chemistry testing provisions as found in the series 63
guidelines.  For example, the GLP provisions at 40 CFR 160.105(a) require that certain
parameters be characterized to appropriately define each batch of the test, control, and
reference substances.  The testing necessary to appropriately define substances may
differ depending on the substance and the nature of the study for which it is being
used.  In most cases it should be possible to appropriately define test, control, and
reference substances with considerably less testing than is normally done to meet
product chemistry guidelines. Your opinion that a "pared down" version of product
chemistry testing guidelines could provide acceptable data is therefore correct. 
However, please note that since the characterization needs may differ between
substances and studies, a "pared down" procedure which is adequate in one
circumstance may not be adequate in another.  Each situation must be evaluated on
the basis of its own merits to determine the level of testing needed to adequately
characterize the substance and mixture.<p>

We are concerned about the instances of non-compliance with the regulations which
you claim are occurring.  If, as you state, persons do not routinely analyze the positive
controls or mixture which they use in their studies they are in noncompliance with the
regulations and subject to potential study rejection s stated at 40 CFR 160.17(a). 
Those who fail to correctly record the compliance status on the submitted statement of
compliance or noncompliance are subject to enforcement actions as stated at 40 CFR
160.17(b).<p>

Finally, please note that the difference between FDA's GLP regulations at 21 CR
58.105(a) and EPA's GLP regulations at 40 CFR 160.105(a), with respect to the use of
label information to characterize certain control articles, has to do with different data
requirements between the two Agencies.  Tests involving the use as controls of
products marketed by competitors are commonly required by FDA but not by EPA.<p>

staff a (703) 308-8290.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of August 27, 1993 to Dr. David Dull in which you
requested clarification regarding the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  That letter was referred to
me for reply.<p>

     Specifically, you requested clarification regarding Advisories 52 and 59.  You felt that
the two advisories presented conflicting interpretations regarding whether a Quality
Assurance Unit (QAU) for a study could belong to the same company that the study
director of that study is president of.  You felt that Advisory 52 suggests that such
situations are acceptable, while Advisory 59 suggests otherwise.<p>

     The conflict which you perceive to exist between Advisories 52 and 59 may result from
a misinterpretation of Advisory 52.  This advisory includes a statement to the effect that
a study director/company president arrangement is not inherently violative of GLPS. 
This is true, since there are no specific regulatory prohibitions against it, and it is
normally possible to deal with compliance issues that arise under such an
arrangement.  For example, if the QAU's independence is compromised, a solution
could be for the sponsor to supply the QAU or contract a QAU from outside the facility.<p>

     Although a study director/company president arrangement is thus not <u>always</u>
violative,
it may nevertheless be violative if QAU independence or other specific conflicts with
management responsibilities are not dealt with.  Advisory 59 provides an example of
one scenario, i.e., where the company president is the study director and performs all
management duties, including overseeing the QAU, in which this type of arrangement
causes definite problems.<p>

     Please note that advisories generally originate as written GLP-related communications
with persons outside EPA.  The Agency makes the content of such communications
available as advisories in the interest of improving the understanding of the entire
regulated community with respect to a particular policy advisement.  However, any
guidance contained in such a communication is intended to apply to a specific
situation.  Misunderstandings may occur if guidance contained in an advisory is applied
to a situation different from that which the original communication addressed.  Where
general policy guidance is intended, it is released in the form of documents intended
specifically for that purpose, such as the Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS)
Questions and Answers Document of May 12, 1992.<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to ______ letter of August 24, 1992 to Ms. Lois Rossi of the Office
of Pesticide Programs.  Her letter was referred to my office for reply.  In her letter
_______ requested, on behalf of ______, a waiver of the Good Laboratory Practices
(GLP) requirement that test substance storage containers be assigned for the duration
of a study (40 CFR part 160.105(c)).  The request is in reference to ________malathion
field crop trial study.  According to _______ letter this study involves applications in
locations throughout the United States, and will involve approximately:  60 fifty-five-gallon drums
and 2,640 five-gallon pails of ultra-low volume formulation; 120 five-gallon
pails of 57% emulsifiable concentrate; and 600 five-gallon pails of ready-to-use
formulation. _________ stated that conforming to this standard would represent a
safety hazard that may conflict with state and local regulations.  She proposed that
_______ be permitted to comply with several recordkeeping and notification steps in
lieu of container retention.<p>

     EPA believes that the provision for assignment of storage containers for the duration of
the study at 40 CFR 160.105(c) is a logical and necessary standard.  In most cases this
provision provides accountability of test material in a manner that imposes no unusual
burden.  In this particular case we agree that the number of containers may pose
unusual encumbrance or safety problems.<p>

     Our staff has reviewed this request and proposal in view of the need to provide
complete accountability for the test material and the potential burden involved in storing
and accounting for the number of containers mentioned described above.  It is our
opinion that certain recordkeeping steps could provide a basis for establishing an
acceptable alternate method for the accounting of test substance storage containers in
lieu of actual storage of the containers for the duration of this study.  We are willing to
allow ________ a conditional exception to this requirement.<p>

     This exception is applicable to the study cited in _______ letter ________,  malathion
field crop trial study) and is conditional on the following:<p>

1)  ________ shall assure the following records are maintained as raw data for this
study:  (a) information of shipments pertaining to each container leaving the storage
site (examples of such records are shipping request records, bills of lading, carrier bills,
and monthly inventories of warehouse activity); (b) test article receipt records at each
testing facility; (c) complete use logs of material taken from containers; (d) a record of
the final destination of the container, including the place and date of disposal or
reclaiming, and any appropriate receipts.<p>

2)  A statement shall be included with the statement of compliance or noncompliance
required at 40 CFR 160.12 describing that this exception to Good Laboratory Practices
is  in accordance with the conditions provided in this letter.<p>

3)   ______ shall prepare an inventory of empt containers before disposal, including
sufficient information to uniquely identify containers, and shall maintain this inventory in
an up-to-date manner recording all arrivals of empty containers and their disposal. 
This record shall be maintained as raw data for this study.<p>

4)  ________ shall retain as raw data for the study a copy of the waiver and a
statement certifying that all conditions of the waiver were compiled with, this statement
to be presented upon any inspection involving the study.<p>

5)  _________ shall identify the locations of facilities:  where test material is stored;
where empty containers are stored prior to disposal; where records of use, shipment,
and disposal of containers are maintained; and where the test substance is used in
studies (i.e., testing facility).  Within two weeks of receipt of notification of any pending
inspection involving this study, _________ shall report the location of each of these
facilities to:<p>

Dear<p>

     This is in response to your letter of June 10, 1993, requesting an opinion regarding
compliance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  In your letter you referred to a series of
communications between yourself and Dr. David Dull, of LDIAD, ________. 
Specifically, you requested clarification of reporting protocols of Quality Assurance Unit
(QAU) inspections.<p>

     On August 19, 1993, in a telephone conversation with Steve Howie, of my staff, you
clarified several of the issues.  You explained that in your organizational structure, the
laboratory Technical Director performs testing facility management functions.  The
Technical Director does not perform any study-related activities.  The Technical
Director, as management oversees the Study Director.  The QAU, which is also not
involved in study-related activities, submits reports to the Technical Director to fulfil
requirements that it submit reports to management.  You asked whether these
procedures conflicted with GLPS.<p>

     One of the more important requirements of GLPS is, as described at 40 CFR 160.35(a),
"... For any given study, the quality assurance unit shall be entirely separate from and
independent of the personnel engaged in the direction and conduct of that study..." 
The GLPS are flexible with regard to organizational structure as long as there are not
conflicts with requirements such as those at 160.35(a).<p>

     It appears that the procedures which you described to Mr. Howie conform with GLPS. 
However, please note that it is essential that these procedures be properly documented
to ensure that they can, at a later date, be determined to have been in place and
followed.  At the time EPA inspected your facility it was apparently unclear to the
inspection team as to whether the QAU, management, study activities were adequately
separated from one another.<p>

     If you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my
staff at (703) 308-8290.<p>

Dear<p>

This is in response to your letter of February 4, 1994 in which you requested guidance
with respect to Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good
Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  The area in which you requested guidance
dealt with final reporting needs for tests terminated as invalid.<p>

You described a scenario involving a test performed at a contract facility where
preliminary evaluations indicated that the test was invalid because of various technical
and scientific problems, e.g., too small a number of test animals.  The client requested
that the test be repeated under an enhanced test design and does not wish that
resources be spent writing a detailed final report for the invalid test.  The client has
instead proposed that an abbreviated report be prepared and filed with the raw data. 
However, the testing facility quality assurance administrator has objected to this
procedure, and contends that a detailed report must be filed for the invalid test.  Your
request specifically addressed whether an abbreviated report could be prepared for the
invalid test, or whether full reporting is required.<p>

You are advised that if the termination of a test believed to be invalid constitutes
termination of a GLP study, the full reporting requirements stated at 40 CFR 160.185
apply.  However, if the study itself is not terminated and additional testing is performed
under the study protocol, it may not be necessary to prepare a separate, full report
complying with all standards at 40 CFR 160.185 for the first test.<p>

In the latter case, the aborted test would be part of the same study as the retest, and a
single final report, covering both tests and complying with all requirements at 40 CFR
160.185, must be prepared.  In this situation the study protocol must be amended prior
to retesting unless the protocol already provides for such retesting.  The amendment
must provide for any changes in experimental design, proposed experimental start and
termination dates, and any other aspects of the study affected by the performance of
the retest.  Standard operating procedures, as appropriate to such circumstances, must
also be followed.  Since the terminated test would be part of the same study as the
retest, all documentation, data, specimens, and other records pertinent to the
terminated test would be subject to the same retention requirements as apply to the
retest.  Please not that records of the terminated test must be maintained even if that
test is treated as a separate study.  Refer to 40 CFR 160.195 and 40 CFR 169.2(k) to
determine the applicable recordkeeping requirements under GLPS and FIFRA section
8, respectively.<p>

Finally, you are reminded that even when a test is terminated for scientific or technical
reasons, test results indicating unreasonable adverse effects of a registered pesticide
are subject to reporting requirements under FIFRA section 6(a)(2).  Please refer to 40
CFR Part 153 Subpart D for further clarification of these reporting needs.<p>

In summary, you may either terminate and prepare a final study report for a flawed test,
or retest under the same study protocol, amended as necessary, and cover both the
aborted test and the retest under the same final report.  In either case, recordkeeping
and reporting requirements apply to the terminated test.<p>

<hr>
</b><p>

Dear<p>

This is in response to your letter of August 27, 1993 to Dr. David Dull in which you
requested clarification regarding several specific questions related to the requirements
of the Federal Insecticide, fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Good Laboratory
Practice Standards (GLPS).  That letter was referred to me for reply.<p>

Specifically, you requested clarification regarding the following questions:<p>

1.  Is the GLP compliance statement a submission requirement and not a final report
requirement [160.185]?<p>

     The GLPS at 40 CFR 160.12 describe the statement of compliance or non-compliance
(compliance statement) as a submission requirement, as opposed to a final reporting
requirement under 40 CFR 160.185.  Note that the list of minimally required final report
elements at 40 CFR 160.185(a) does not include the compliance statement.  Please
note also, however, that this section also states that the components of the final report
are not limited to items mentioned in this list.  If, for example, either the study protocol
or the facility's standard operating procedures (SOP) stated that the study final report
shall include the compliance statement, this would become a required final report
element.<p>

2.  During the course of a study, it is determined that the study will be terminated or
discontinued and not submitted to the Agency.  Can an amendment to the study
protocol be prepared that states the study will be terminated and a final report will not
be issued [the protocol and any raw data generated during the study will be archived;
160.195(b)(3)]?  If a final report must be issued, should a compliance statement be
issued and the report identify that the study was terminated, will not be submitted or
used to support the registration of a pesticide, and be signed by the study director?<p>

     A final report is required for every study.  Amending the protocol to state that no final
report is to be issued does not alter the fact that the study will be in non-compliance.<p>

The GLPS do not require that an internally archived final report include a statement
indicating that the report is not to be submitted to EPA unless it has become required to
include such a statement under the study protocol or SOPs.  Note that the study
director is required to sign the final report, so if such a statement is an element of the
final report, it by nature is signed by the study director when the final report is signed.<p>

<p>

Finally, please note that should the data eventually be submitted to the Agency, a
compliance statement will be required regardless of whether it was generated at the
time of the study.  40 CFR 160.12 requires that the compliance statement submitted to
the Agency must be a single statement, signed by the study director, sponsor, and
submitter.<p>

3.  Either prior to or after a completed study has been submitted to the Agency, an area
of non-compliance is identified in a study.  Can an amended compliance statement be
issued as a correction to the final report [160.185(14)(c)]?<p>

     When a report is submitted to the Agency, it must include a true and accurate
compliance statement as required at 40 CFR 160.12.  The compliance statements are
integral in determining the acceptability of the data included in such submissions for
the purpose of regulatory decision making.  Submission of a false compliance
statement is violative under FIFRA section 12(a)(2)(M), (Q), or (R) depending on the
nature of the falsification.<p>

     Subsequent submissions to correct inaccuracies do not alter the compliance status of
the original submission.  However, if a testing facility, sponsor, or submitter discovers
that the compliance statement was in fact in error, they are advised to immediately
submit an amended detailed compliance statement to the Agency.  In addition, they are
advised to contact Dr. David Dull, Acting Director, Agriculture Division, Office of
Compliance, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.<p>

     An amendment to the compliance statement would not constitute an amendment to the
study final report as described at 40 CFR 160.185(a), unless the compliance statement
constitutes an element of such report as described above.<p>

4.  Prior to submission of a completed study (signed by the study director), it is
determined by the sponsor or applicant that the compliance statement is not accurate
(e.g., an additional compliance issue is identified).  However, the study director does
not feel that the issue is an area of non-compliance and refuses to identify this in the
compliance statement.  Can the sponsor or applicant reference the study director's
signed compliance statement and note additional items on non-compliance in a
separate compliance statement?<p>

     The GLPS require at 40 CFR 160.12 that a compliance statement, signed by the
sponsor, applicant, and study director, be submitted for each study.  The statement
must be one of three types given.  This requirement does not provide flexibility for
multiple statements certifying different levels of compliance.<p>

     The Agency depends upon the truth and accuracy of the statement, signed by all
responsible parties.  It is difficult for the Agency to draw conclusions regarding the
compliance status of a study if there is not agreement with respect to compliance
among the principal parties involved in the study.  The implication would be that one of
the statements is false.  You are advised to contact our office to resolve disagreements
over compliance issues.<p>

If you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my
staff at (703) 308-8290.<p>

Yours sincerely,<p>

Keywords: Management, owner, technician, QAU relationships<p>

<p>

Dear<p>

This is in response to your letter of February 15, 1994, in which you requested
clarification regarding the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
Good Laboratory Practice Standards (GLPS).  Your question concerned the potential
activities performed by the management of a testing facility.<p>

Specifically, you asked whether you, as the owner of a small business, could
participate in field projects in the capacity of "technician".  You stated that while it would
be easiest to hire more people the company size and budget could make this difficult.<p>

Under GLPS, there must be testing facility management as described at 40 CFR
160.31.  Further, there must be a study director and quality assurance unit as stated at
40 CFR 160.33 and 40 CFR 160.35, respectively.  The quality assurance unit (QAU)
must be independent of all study personnel.<p>

If the testing facility management personnel who oversee the QAU directly engage in
study activities, the QAU cannot be considered to be independent from study
personnel.  This violates GLPS.  Management involvement in studies may trigger other
violations as well.  For example, if the management personnel who oversee the study
director directly engage in the study, this would interfere with the study director's
overall responsibility for the technical conduct of the study.<p>

Generally, the GLPS are structured to anticipate that management and study personnel
consist of different individuals.  As a result compliance issues may arise when
individuals who are part of the testing facility management perform study activities. 
Therefore, although the GLPS do not explicitly state that no management personnel
may be involved in study activities, such involvement may lead to violations.<p>

If you have any questions concerning this response, please contact Steve Howie of my
staff at (703) 308-8290.<p>

Yours sincerely,<p>

<h1><center>PR NOTICE 86-5</h1>
</center>
<b><h3><center>NOTICE TO PRODUCERS, FORMULATORS, DISTRIBUTORS AND
REGISTRANTS</h3></b>
<p>
</center>
<p>
Attention: Persons responsible for Federal registration of pesticides.<p>

Subject: Standard format for data submitted under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and certain provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(FFDCA).<p>

<b>I.   Purpose </b><p>

To require data to be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a standard
format.  This Notice also provides additional guidance about, and illustrations of, the required
formats.<p>

<b>II.  Applicability</b> <p>

This PR Notice applies to all data that are submitted to EPA to satisfy data requirements for
granting or maintaining pesticide registrations, experimental use permits, tolerances, and related
approvals under certain provisions of FIFRA and FFDCA.  These data are defined in FIFRA
10(d)(1).  This Notice does not apply to commercial, financial, or production information, which
are, and must continue to be submitted differently under separate cover.<p>

<b>III.  Effective Date </b><p>

This notice is effective on November 1, 1986.  Data formatted according to this notice may be
submitted prior to the effective date.  As of the effective date, submitted data packages that do
not conform to these requirements may be returned to the submitter for necessary revision.<p>

<b>IV.  Background </b><p>

On September 26, 1984, EPA published proposed regulations in the Federal Register (49 FR
37956) which include Requirements for Data Submission (40 CFR 158.32), and Procedures for
Claims of Confidentiality of Data (40 CFR 158.33).  These regulations specify the format for
data submitted to EPA under Section 3 of FIFRA and Section 408 and 409 of FFDCA, and
procedure which must be followed to make and substantiate claims of confidentiality.  No
entitlement to data confidentiality are changed, either by the proposed regulation or by this
notice.<p>

OPP is making these requirements mandatory through this Notice to gain resource-saving
benefits from their use before the entire proposed regulation becomes final.  Adequate lead time
is being provided for Submitters to comply with the new requirements. <p>

<b>V.  Relationship of this Notice to Other OPP Policy and Guidance</b><p>

While this Notice contains requirements for organizing and formatting submittals of supporting
data, it does not address the substance of test reports themselves.  "Data reporting" guidance is
now under development in OPP, and will specify how the study objectives, protocol,
observations, findings, and conclusions are organized and presented within the stud report.  The
data reporting guidance will be compatible with submittal format requirements described in this
Notice.<p>

OPP has also promulgated a policy (PR Notice 86-4 dated April 15, 1986) that provides for early
screening of certain applications for registration under FIFRA para.  3.  The objective of the
screen is to avoid the additional costs and prolonged delays associated with handling
significantly incomplete application packages.  As of the effective date of this Notice, the screen
will include in its criteria for acceptance of application packages the data formatting
requirements
described herein. <p>

OPP as also established a public docket which imposes deadlines for inserting into the docket
documents submitted in connection with Special Reviews and Registration Standards (see 40
CFR 154.15 and 155.32).  To meet these deadlines, OPP is requiring an additional copy of any
data submitted to the docket.  Please refer to Page 10 for more information about this
requirement.<p>

For several years, OPP has required that each application for registration or other action include
a list of all applicable data requirements and an indication of how each is satisfied - the statement
of the method of support for the application.  Typically, many requirements are satisfied by
reference to data previously submitted - either by the applicant or by another party.  That
requirement is not altered by this notice, which applies only to data <b><i>submitted</i></b>
with an
application.<p>

<b>VI.  Format Requirements </b><p>

A more detailed discussion of these format requirements follows the index on the next page, and
samples of some of the requirements are attached.  Except for the language of the two alternative
forms of the Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims (shown in <a
href="#attach3">Attachment 3</a>) which cannot be
altered, these samples are illustrative.  As long as the required information is included and
clearly identifiable, the form of the samples may be altered to reflect the submitter's
preference.<p>

<b><a name="t1"></a>A.  Organization of Submittal Package</b><p>

A "submittal package" consists of all studies submitted at the same time for review in support of
a single regulatory action, along with a transmittal document and other related administrative
material (e.g. the method of support statement, EPA Forms 8570-1, 8570-4, 8570-20, etc.)  As
appropriate.<p>

Data Submitters must organize each submittal package as described in this notice.  The
transmittal and any other administrative material must be grouped together in the first physical
volume.  Each study included in the submittal package must then be bound separately.<p>

Submitters sometimes provide additional materials that are intended to clarify, emphasize, or
otherwise comment to help Product Managers and reviewers better understand the submittal.<p>

<UL>
<LI>If such materials related to <b><i>one</i></b> study, they should be included as an
appendix to that
study.
<li>If such materials relate to <b><i>more than one</i></b> study (as for example a summary
of all
studies in a discipline) or to the submittal in general, they must be included in the submittal
package as a separate study (with title page and statement of confidentiality claims).
</UL>
<p>
<br>
<b><a name="t2">B.  Transmittal Document</b></a><p>

The first item in each submittal package must be a transmittal document.  This document
identifies the submitter or all joint submitters; the regulatory action in support of which the
package is being submitted, i.e., a registration application, petition, experimental use permit
(EUP), para.  3(c)(2)(B) data call-in, para.  6(a)(2) submittal, or a special review; the transmittal
date; and a list of all individual studies included in the package in the order of their appearance,
showing (usually by Guideline reference number) the data requirement(s) addressed by each one. 
The EPA-assigned number for the regulatory action (e.g. the registration, EUP, or tolerance
petition number) should be included in the transmittal document as well, if it is known to the
submitter.  See Attachment 1 for an example of an acceptable transmittal document.<p>

The list of included studies in the transmittal of a data submittal package supporting a
registration application should be subdivided by discipline, reflecting the order in which data
requirements appear in 40 CFR 158.<p>

The list of included studies in the transmittal of a data submittal package supporting a petition
for tolerance or an application for an EUP should be subdivided into sections A, B, C,... of the
petition or application, as defined in 40 CFR 180.7 and 158.125, (petitions) or Pesticide
Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision I (EUPs) as appropriate.<p>

When a submittal package supports a tolerance petition <b><i>and</i></b> an application for a
registration or an EUP, list the petition studies first, then the balance of the studies.  Within these
two groups of studies follow the instructions above.<p>

<b><a name="t3">C.  Individual Studies </a></b><p>

A study is the report of a single scientific investigation, including all supporting analyses
required for logical completeness.  A study should be identifiable and distinguishable by a
conventional bibliographic citation including author, date, and title.  Studies generally
correspond in scope to a single Guideline requirement for supporting data, with some exceptions
discussed in section C.1.  Each study included in a submittal package must be bound as a
separate entity.  (See comments on binding studies on page 9).<p>

Each study must be consecutively paginated, beginning from the title page as page 1.  The total
number of pages in the complete study must be shown on the study title page.  In addition (to
ensure that inadvertently separated pages can be reassociated with the proper study during
handling or review) use either of the following:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Include the total number of pages in the complete study on each page (i.e., 1 of 250, 2 of
250, ... 250 of 250).
<li>Include a company name or mark and study number on each page of the study, e.g.,
Company Name -1986-23.  Never reuse a study number for marking the pages of subsequent
studies.
</UL><p>

When a single study is extremely long, binding it in multiple volumes is permissible so long as
the entire study is paginates in a single series, and each volume is plainly identified by the study
title and its position in the multi-volume sequence.<p>

<b><a name="t3">C.1 Special Considerations for Identifying Studies </a></b><p>

Some studies raise special problems in study identification, because they address Guidelines of
broader than normal scope or for other reasons.<p>

a. <b><i>Safety Studies</i></b>.  Several Guidelines require testing for safety in more than one
species.  In these cases each species tested should be reported as a separate study, and bound
separately.<p>

Extensive supplemental reports of pathology reviews, feed analyses, historical control data, and
the like are often associated with safety studies.  Whenever possible these should be submitted
with primary reports of the study, and bound with the primary study as appendices.  When such
supplemental reports are submitted independently of the primary report, take care to fully
identify the primary report to which they pertain.<p>

Batteries of acute toxicity tests, performed on the same end use product and covered by a single
title page, may be bound together and reported as a single study.<p>

b. <b><i>Product Chemistry Studies</i></b>.  All product chemistry data within a submittal
package
submitted in support of an end-use product produced from registered manufacturing-use products
should be bound as a single study under a single title page.<p>

Produce chemistry data submitted in support of a technical product, other manufacturing-use
product, an experimental use permit, an import tolerance petition, or an end-use product
produced from unregistered source ingredients, should be bound as a single study for each
Guideline <b><i>series</i></b> (61, 62, and 63) for conventional pesticides, or for the
equivalent
subject range for biorational pesticides.  The first of the three studies in a complete product
chemistry submittal for a biochemical pesticide would cover Guidelines 151-10, 151-11, and
151-12; the second would cover Guidelines 151-13, 151-15, and 151-16; the third would cover
Guideline 151-17.  The first study for a microbial pesticide would cover Guidelines 151-20,
151-21, and 151-22; the second would cover Guidelines 151-23 and 151-25; the third would
cover
Guideline 151-26.<p>

Note particularly that product chemistry studies are likely to contain Confidential Business
Information as defined in FIFRA para.  10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C), and if so must be handled as
described in section D.3. of this notice.<p>

c. <b><i>Residue Chemistry Studies</i></b>.  Guidelines 171-4, 153-3, and 153-4 are
extremely broad
in scope; studies addressing residue chemistry requirements must thus be defined at a level
below
that of the Guideline code.  The general principle, however, of limiting a study to the report of a
single investigation still applies fully.  Data should be treated as a single study and bound
separately for each analytical method, each report of the nature of the residue in a single crop or
animal species, and for each report of the magnitude of residues resulting from treatment of a
single crop or from processing a single crop.  When more than one commodity is derived from a
single crop (such as beet tops and beet roots) residue data on all such commodities should be
reported as a single study.  When multiple field trials are associated with a single crop, all such
trials should be reported as a single study.<p>

<b><a name="t4">D.  Organization of Each Study Volume </a></b><p>

Each complete study must include all applicable elements in the list below, in the order
indicated.  (Also see Page 17).  Several of these elements are further explained in the following
paragraphs.  Entries in the column headed "example" cite the page number of this notice where
the element is illustrated.<p>

<b><i>Element</i></b>  - <b><i>When Required</i></b>
<ul>
<LI>Study Title Page  - Always
<li>Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims  - One of the two alternative forms of this
statement
is always required.
<li>Certification of Good Laboratory Practice  - If study reports laboratory work subject to GLP
requirements.
<li>Flagging Statements  - For certain toxicology studies.  (When flagging requirements are
finalized.)
<li>Body of Study  - Always - with an English language translation if required.
<li>Study Appendices  - At submitter's option
<li>Cover Sheet to Confidential Attachment  - If CBI is claimed under FIFRA para. 
10(d)(1)(A), (B), or  
<li>CBI Attachment  - If CBI is claimed under FIFRA para.  10(d)(1)(A), (B), or  
<li>Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims  - Only if confidentiality is claimed
on a basis other than FIFRA para.  10(d)(1)(A), (B), or  
</UL>
<p>
<b><a name="t5">D.1.  Study Title Page </a></b><p>

A title page is always required for each submitted study, published or unpublished.  The title
page must always be freely releasable to requestors; DO NOT INCLUDE CBI ON THE TITLE
PAGE.  An example of an acceptable title page is on page 12 of this notice.  The following
information must appear on the title page:<p>

<ol>
<li>Study Title.  The study title should be as descriptive as possible.  It must clearly identify the
substance(s) tested and correspond to the name of the data requirement as it appears in the
Guidelines.
<li>Data requirement addressed.  Include on the title page the Guideline number(s) of the
specific requirement(s) addressed by the study.
<li>Author(s).  Cite only individuals with primary intellectual responsibility for the content of
the
study.  Identify them plainly as authors, to distinguish them from the performing laboratory,
study sponsor, or other names that may also appear on the title page.
<li>Study Date.  The title page must include a single date for the study.  If parts of the study
were performed at different times, use only the date of the latest element in the study.
<li>Performing Laboratory Identification.  If the study reports work done by one or more
laboratories, include on the title page the name and address of the performing laboratory or
laboratories, and the laboratory's internal project number(s) for the work.  Clearly distinguish the
laboratory's project identifier from any other reference numbers provided by the study sponsor
or submitter.
<li>Supplemental Submissions.  If the study is a commentary on or supplement to another
previously submitted study, or if it responds to EPA questions raised with respect to an earlier
study, include on the title page elements a.  through d.  for the previously submitted study, along
with the EPA Master Record identifier (MRID) or Accession number of the earlier study if you
know these numbers.  (Supplements submitted in the same submittal package as the primary
study should be appended to and bound with the primary study.  Do not include supplements to
more than one study under a single title page).
<li>Facts of Publication.  If the study is a reprint of a published document, identify on the title
page all relevant facts of publication, such as the journal title, volume, issue, inclusive page
numbers, and publication date.

<b><a name="t6">D.2.  Statements of Data Confidentiality </a></b><p>

Each submitted study must be accompanied by one of the two alternative forms of the Statement
of Data Confidentiality Claims specified in the proposed regulation in para.  158.33 (b) an (c). 
(See Attachment 3).  These statements apply <b><i>only</i></b> to claims of data
confidentiality based
on FIFRA para 10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C).   Use the appropriate alternative form of the statement
either to assert a claim of para.  10(d)(1) data confidentiality (para 158.33(b)) or to waive such a
claim (para 158.33(c)).  In either case, the statement must be signed and dated, and must include
the typed name and title of the official who signs it.  Do not make CBI claims with respect to
analytical methods associated with petitions for tolerances or emergency exemptions (see NOTE
in <a href="#attach3">Attachment 3</a>).<p>

<b><a name="t7">D.3.  Confidential Attachment</a> </b><p>

If the claim is made that a study includes confidential business information as defined by the
criteria of FIFRA para.  10(d)(1)(A), (B), or   (as described in D.2. above) all such
information must be excised from the body of the study and confined to a separate study-specific
Confidential Attachment.  Each passage of CBI so isolated must be identified by a reference
number cited within the body of the study at the point from which the passage was excised (See
<a href="#attach5">Attachment 5</a>).<p>

The Confidential Attachment to a study must be identified by a cover sheet fully identifying the
parent study, and must be clearly marked "Confidential Attachment".  An appropriately
annotated photocopy of the parent study title page may be sued as this cover sheet.  Paginate the
Confidential Attachment separately from the body of the study, beginning with page 1 of X on
the title page.  Each passage confined to the Confidential Attachment must be associated with a
specific cross reference to the page(s) in the main body of the study on which it is cited, and with
a reference to the applicable passage(s) of FIFRA para 10(d)(1) on which confidentiality claim is
based.<p>

<b><a name="t8">D.4.  Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims </a>(See <a
href="#attach4">Attachment 4</a>)</b><p>

If you wish to make a claim of confidentiality for any portion of a submitted study <b><i>other
than</i></b> described by FIFRA para.  10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C), the following provisions
apply:<p>

<ul>
<li>The specific information to which the claim applies must be clearly marked in the body of he
study as subject to a claim of confidentiality.
<li>A Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims must be submitted, identifying
each passage claimed confidential and describing in detail the basis for the claim.  A list of the
points to address in such a statement is included in Attachment 4 on pg.  14.
<li>The Supplemental Statement of Data Confidentiality Claims must be signed and dated and
must include the typed name and title of the official who signed it.
</ul>
<p>
<b><a name="t9">D.5.  Good Laboratory Practice Compliance Statement </a></b><p>

This statement is required if the study contains laboratory work subject to GLP requirements
specified in 40 CFR 160.  Samples of these statements are shown in Attachment 6.<p>

<b><a name="t10">E.  Reference to Previously Submitted Data </a></b><p>

DO NOT RESUBMIT A STUDY THAT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN SUBMITTED FOR
ANOTHER PURPOSE unless EPA specifically requests it.  A copy of the title page plus the
MRID number (if known) is sufficient to allow us to retrieve the study immediately for review. 
This prevents duplicate entries in the Agency files, and saves you the cost of sending more
copies of the study.  References to previously submitted studies should <b><i>not</i></b> be
included
in the transmittal document, but should be incorporated into the statement of the method of
support for the application.<p>

<b><a name="t11">F.  Physical Format Requirements </a></b><p>

All elements in the data submittal package must be on uniform 8  by 11 inch white paper,
printed on one side only in black ink, with high contrast and good resolution.  Bindings for
individual studies must be secure, but easily removable to permit disassembly for microfilming. 
Check with EPA for special instructions before submitting data in any medium other than paper,
such as film or magnetic media.<p>

Please be particularly attentive to the following points:<p>

<ul>
<li>Do not include frayed or torn pages.
<li>Do not include carbon copies, or copies in other than black ink.
<li>Make sure that photocopies are clear, complete, and fully readable.
<li>Do not include oversize computer printouts or fold-out pages.
<li>Do not bind any documents with glue or binding tapes.
<li>Make sure that all pages of each study, including any attachments or appendices, are present
and in correct sequence.
</ul>
<p>
<b><i>Number of Copies Required</i></b>  - All submittal packages except those associated
with a
Registration Standard or Special Review (see part G below) must be provided in
<b><i>three</i></b>
complete, identical copies.  (The proposed regulations specified two copies; three are not being
required to expedite and reduce the cost of processing data into the OPP Pesticide Document
Management System and getting it into review.)<p>

<b><a name="t12">G.  Special Requirements for Submitting Data to the Docket </a></b><p>

Data submittal packages associated with a Registration Standard or Special Review must e
provided in <b><i>four</i></b> copies, from one of which all material claimed as CBI has been
excised.  This fourth copy will become part of the public docket for the RS or SR case.  If no
claims of confidentiality are made for the study, the fourth copy should be identical to the other
three.  When portions of a study submitted in support of an RS or SR are claimed as CBI, the
first three copies will include the CBI material as provided in section D of this notice.  The
following special preparation is required for the fourth copy.<p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the  Supplemental Statement of Data confidentiality Claims'.
<li>Remove the  Confidential Attachment'.
<li>Excise from the body of the study any information you claim as confidential, even if it does
not fall within the scope of FIFRA para.  10(d)(1)(A), (B), or (C).  Do not close up or paraphrase
text remaining after this excision.
<li>Mark the fourth copy plainly on both its cover and its title page with the phrase  Public
Docket Material - contains no information claimed as confidential'.

NOTE: Applicants for permanent or temporary tolerances should note that it is OPP policy that
no permanent tolerance, temporary tolerance, or request for an emergency exemption
incorporating an analytical method, can be approved unless the applicant waives all claims of
confidentiality for the analytical method.  These analytical methods are published in the FDA
Pesticide Analytical Methods Manual, and therefore cannot be claimed as confidential.  OPP
implements this policy by returning submitted analytical methods, for which confidentiality
claims have been made, to the submitter, to obtain the confidentiality waiver before they can be
processed.<p>

  SUMMARY:  EPA is issuing this final
  rule that expands the regulations to require
  compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards for testing conducted
  in the field and for such disciplines of testing as ecological effects, chemical fate,
  residue chemistry, and, as required to be submitted by 40 CFR 158.640, product
  performance (efficacy testing).  EPA is amending these regulations to ensure the
  quality and integrity of all data submitted to EPA in conjunction with pesticide
  product registration, or other marketing and research permits.  EPA is also
  amending the FIFRA GLP standards to incorporate many of the changes made by
  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to its GLP regulations (52 FR 33768,
  September 4, 1987; 21 CFR Part 58).<p>
  
  <p>
  
  DATE: Effective: This rule becomes effective on October 16, 1989.<p>
  
  Compliance: All studies conducted, initiated, or supported after the effective date
  of this rule shall be subject to these regulations.<p>

  <a name="Intro"><b>I. INTRODUCTION</a><p>
  
  </b><p>
  
       EPA is amending the FIFRA GLP standards (40 CFR Part 160) to incorporate
  many of the changes made by the Food and Drug Administration to its GLP
  regulations.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  <i><b>A. Legal Authority</b><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
       These standards are promulgated under the authority of section 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 18,
  24(c), and 25(a) of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq., as amended, sections 408, 409,
  and 701 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 301 et
  seq., and the Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  <a name="B"><i><b>B. Background</b></a><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
       EPA originally published FIFRA GLP standards in the Federal Register of
  November 29, 1983 (48 FR 53946), which were codified as 40 CFR part 160.  At
  the same time, EPA published GLP standards applicable to testing required under
  the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA, 48 FR 53922, 40 CFR part 792).  These
  regulations were promulgated in response to investigations by EPA and FDA
  during the mid-1970s which revealed that some studies submitted to the Agencies
  had not been conducted in accordance with acceptable laboratory practices. 
  Some studies had been conducted so poorly that the resulting data could not be
  relied upon in EPA's regulatory decision-making process.  For instance, some 
  studies had been submitted which did not adhere to specified protocols, were
  conducted by underqualified personnel and supervisors, or were not adequately
  monitored by study sponsors.  In some cases results were selectively reported,
  underreported, or fraudulently reported.  In addition, it was discovered that some
  testing facilities displayed poor animal care procedures and inadequate
  recordkeeping techniques.  The FIFRA GLP standards specify minimum practices
  and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity
  of data submitted to EPA in support of a research or marketing permit for a
  pesticide product.<p>
  
       When EPA published its final FIFRA and TSCA GLP standards in the Federal
  Register of November 29, 1983, EPA sought to harmonize the requirements and
  language with those regulations promulgated by FDA in the Federal Register of
  December 22, 1978 (43 FR 60013), and codified as 21 CFR part 58.  Differences
  between the two Agencies' current GLP regulations exist only to the extent
  necessary to reflect the Agencies' different statutory responsibilities under TSCA,
  FIFRA, and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).  Similar to the
  FDA GLP regulations, the FIFRA and TSCA GLP standards delineate standards
  for studies designed to determine the health effects of a test substance; however,
  the TSCA GLP standards also contain provisions related to environmental testing
  (i.e., ecological effects and chemical fate).<p>
  
       Compliance with EPA's FIFRA and TSCA GLP standards has been monitored
  through a program of laboratory inspections and study audits coordinated between
  EPA and FDA.  Under an Interagency Agreement originated in 1978, FDA carries out
  GLP inspections at laboratories which conduct health effects testing.  EPA primarily
  performs GLP inspections for environmental laboratories and conducts data audits
  for health effects and environmental studies.<p>
  
       After a thorough review of its GLP regulations and compliance program, FDA
  concluded that some of the provisions of the GLP regulations needed to be clarified,
  amended, or deleted to reduce the regulatory burden on testing facilities. 
  Accordingly, FDA revised its GLP regulations in the Federal Register of September
  4, 1987 (52 FR 33768).  These GLP revisions are intended to simplify the regulations
  without compromising study integrity.<p>
  
       EPA agrees with FDA that many provisions of the GLP regulations can be
  streamlined without compromising the goals of the GLP standards.  Therefore, EPA
  is amending the FIFRA GLP standards to incorporate many of the changes made by
  FDA to its revised GLP regulations.  In addition, EPA is expanding the scope of the
  FIFRA GLP standards to include the environmental testing provisions currently found
  in the TSCA GLP standards.  EPA's revision to the FIFRA GLP standards also
  extends their scope to include product performance data (efficacy testing) as
  currently required to be submitted by 40 CFR 158.640.  In summary, the FIFRA GLP 
  standards will allow EPA to ensure the quality and integrity of all data submitted in
  support of pesticide product research or marketing permits.  Elsewhere in this 
  Federal Register, EPA is making similar changes to the TSCA GLP standards.<p>

  <hr>
  
  <a name="C"><i><b>C. Consistency With FDA GLP Regulations</b></a><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
       It is EPA's policy to minimize the regulatory burden on the public which might
  arise from conflicting requirements promulgated under different regulatory authorities. 
  In keeping with this policy, the final FIFRA 1983 GLP standards, 40 CFR part 160,
  followed the format and with few exceptions, the wording of FDA's final GLP
  regulations, <a href="./fdaglp_a.htm">21 CFR part 58</a>.  Differences between the EPA and
FDA
  GLP regulations
  were based upon varying needs and responsibilities under each Agency's regulatory
  statutes.  This revision to the FIFRA GLP standards follows this same policy by
  conforming to many of the changes FDA made to its GLP regulations, published in
  the Federal Register of September 4, 1987 (52 FR 33768).  EPA has varied from
  FDA's revised GLP regulations only when necessary due to EPA's statutory
  responsibilities.  The most significant differences between the EPA and FDA revised
  GLP regulations are the scope of the testing and the test systems affected.<p>
  
       More specifically, EPA is requiring compliance with the FIFRA GLP standards
  for all studies submitted to EPA which are intended to support pesticide product
  research or marketing permits.  Under the 1983 FIFRA GLP regulations EPA only
  required GLP compliance under FIFRA for health effects testing.  However, unlike
  FDA, testing required by EPA in support of research or marketing permits may
  include ecological effects, environmental and chemical fate, and efficacy (as
  stipulated by 40 CFR 158.640 Product performance data requirements), as well as
  health effects testing.  Therefore, in an effort to attain consistency in the quality and
  the integrity of all data submitted to the Agency, EPA has determined that it is
  necessary to expand the scope of the FIFRA GLP standards to require that all types
  of testing which are used to obtain data in support of research or marketing permits
  be conducted in accordance with the amended GLP standards that are required to
  be submitted under 40 CFR 158.640.<p>
  
       EPA's amended FIFRA GLP standards also vary from FDA's in their coverage
  of testing conducted in the field.  To ensure the quality and integrity of all data
  submitted in support of research or marketing permits, EPA believes that GLP
  standards must apply whenever data collection occurs.  Because many of the test
  data required by EPA under FIFRA are developed in the field, or more accurately in
  outdoor laboratories (i.e., ground water studies, air monitoring studies, degradation
  in soil, etc.), EPA is including field testing within the scope of the standards.<p>
  
       EPA's FIFRA GLP standards also differ from FDA's in the  scope of the
  requirements provided for test system care facilities, test system supply facilities, and
  test system care.  Because testing required by FDA is focused on health testing, in
  which animals are the central test system, it is appropriate for FDA's GLP regulations
  to focus on requirements for appropriate animal care facilities (21 CFR 58.43),
  adequate animal supply facilities (21 CFR 58.45), and proper animal care (21 CFR
  58.90).  However, the broad range of testing required by EPA may involve plants,
  soils, microorganisms, as well as animals, for the primary test systems.  To ensure
  the quality and integrity of all data submitted to EPA,  160.43 Animal care facilities,
   160.45 Animal supply facilities, and  160.90 Animal care are being expanded to
  cover facilities, handling, and care of all test systems.  Accordingly, EPA is retitling
  these sections as follows:  160.43 Test system care facilities,  160.45 Test system
  supply facilities, and  160.90 Animal and other test system care.  Further, in most
  instances, EPA is replacing the term "animal," which is currently used in the FIFRA
  GLP standards, with the broader term "test system."  Specifically, this change occurs
  in   160.43, 160.45, 160.81, 160.90 and 160.120.  These changes are further
  discussed in Unit II of this preamble. <p>
  
       The remaining differences between EPA and FDA GLP regulations are
  described in the preamble to this final rule and the preamble to the FIFRA GLP
  standards, published in the Federal Register of November 29, 1983 (48 FR 53946).
  EPA has coordinated this final rule with FDA and has considered public comments
  on the December 28, 1987 EPA proposal (52 FR 48920).<p>

  <a name="IIA"><b>II. SUMMARY OF COMMENTS AND RESPONSES</a><p>
  
  </b><p>
  
       EPA received 43 comment letters: 24 from manufacturers of pesticide
  products regulated by EPA, 8 from associations, 10 from testing or consulting
  laboratories, and 1 from another government agency.  The majority of the comments
  supported the proposed changes, although numerous suggestions were made for
  additional revisions to parts of the 1983 FIFRA GLP regulations not subject to this
  rulemaking or modifications to the proposed changes.  Comments that raised
  important policy questions, suggested modification to the essence of the proposed
  regulation, or required an individual response, are discussed below.  Comments
  addressing changes to the GLP standards that were not proposed are not the subject
  of this rulemaking.  However, all comments made have been placed in the public
  record.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  <i><b>A. General Provisions</b><p>
  
  <p>
  
  </i>1. <i>Scope<p>
  
  <p>
  
  <b>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should specify exactly what categories of studies (especially
  efficacy) are covered under the revised GLP regulations since they are discussed in
  the preamble and will not appear at 40 CFR part 160 when the final rule is published.<p>
  
  <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA intends GLP standards to cover all types of studies required to
  be
  submitted and does not feel it necessary to list each type.<p>
  
       Please note that EPA is developing additional product performance
  regulations.  EPA plans to consider the impact that GLP standards will have on these
  new product performance requirements to determine if the full scope of GLP
  standards should apply to studies performed to fulfil these requirements.  Unless the
  GLP rule is modified to specifically exclude certain parts of product performance
  regulations, the full GLP rule will apply to all existing and prospective product
  performance studies required under  40 CFR 158.640.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  2. <i>Definitions</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
  (a) <i>Batch</i> - The definition of "batch" is expanded to include reference substances. 
  This was an omission in the proposed rule that is corrected in the final rule to
  maintain consistency with the use of the term in  160.105(a).<p>
  
  <p>
  
  (b) <i>Carrier</i> <p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The word "systems" should replace the word "organisms" in
  the
  definition of "carrier," to be consistent with the term "test system."<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA concurs with the suggestion.  To be consistent with the
  definition of "test systems, ' the word is changed accordingly.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should revise the list in parentheses that follows the
  word
  "material" in the definition of "carrier" to make it all inclusive.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA has decided to add the phrase "including but not limited
  to
  *  *  *", to indicate that the list provides examples and is not meant to be all inclusive.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  <p>
  
  (c) <i>Control substance</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Since "material" conveys a broader description than
  "substance" and is already used in definitions for "carrier,"  "control substance," and
  "reference substance," "chemical substance" should be changed to "chemical
  material" in the definition of "control substance."<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA does not believe that a change in terminology is needed
  to
  broaden the definition since the term "material" is already included in the present
  definition.  The term "substance" must be retained to maintain consistency with
  TSCA and the TSCA GLP standards.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <i><b>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should delete the phrase "for no-effect levels" in the
  definition of control substance.  The definition as written is too narrow and excludes
  analytical chemistry (e.g., chemical fate, residues chemistry) operations where the
  term "control" has a meaning distinctly different from biological effects.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  Since the purpose of the analytical control is to establish
  eventually that none of the materials administered to the test system interfere with
  identification of the test substance and its degradate(s) and metabolite(s), EPA
  agrees that the terminology is too limiting and is replacing the phrase "for no-effect
  levels" with the phrase "for known chemical or biological measurements."  The
  definition now reads:  "Control substance means any chemical substance or mixture,
  or any other material other than a test substance, feed, or water, that is administered
  to the test system in the course of a study for the purpose of establishing a basis for
  comparison with the test substance for known chemical or biological measurements."<p>
  
  <p>
  
  (d) <i>Experimental start and termination dates</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  These dates would be difficult to predict, especially for field
  studies, because they would be subject to natural or man-made conditions that
  cannot be controlled or anticipated.  Since the dates would be subject to change, 
  many protocol amendments would be required, thereby creating an undue
  administrative burden.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  The experimental start and termination dates specified in the
  protocol are merely proposed dates.  Therefore if the actual experimental start or
  termination date is different from the proposed dates no protocol amendment shall
  be required.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  (e) <i>Reference substance</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  If EPA intended the term "reference substance" to include
  analytical and calibration standards, then several other sections of the proposed rule
  which mention "reference substance," would also require the same types of records
  to be kept for analytical standards.  This would constitute an excessive burden on
  management which would require maintaining various records that do not add any
  value to the study.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The definition of reference substance is intended to include
  analytical reference standards.  Therefore, EPA has modified the definition of
  "reference substance," as follows: "Reference substance means any chemical
  substance or mixture, analytical reference standard, or material, other than a test
  substance, feed, or water, that is administered to, or used, in analyzing the test
  system in the course of a study for purposes of establishing a basis for comparison
  with the test substance for known chemical or biological measurements."  EPA
  believes this change eliminates any ambiguity in the definition.<p>
  
       EPA disagrees that inclusion of analytical reference standards in this part
  constitutes an excess documentation burden or adds no value to the study. 
  Documentation which supports defining analytical reference standards should not
  require excessive paperwork since common laboratory practices already require
  assurance of the validity of standards in order to make certain that the
  measurements are accurate.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  (f) <i>Study</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  "Basic exploratory studies" are excluded from GLP
  standards,
  but the results of such studies may be required to meet GLP standards, if included
  in support of research or marketing permits.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA does not wish to discourage basic exploratory testing and
  does not explicitly require GLP standards for such tests even if the data are later
  submitted to EPA.  However, if the data are to be used in sole support of a marketing
  permit such non-GLP studies may not be accepted.  GLP standards are required
  when data is developed in the context of a study that is required to be submitted to
  EPA in support of a research or marketing permit.  When GLP standards were not
  followed in the case of a study performed with the original intent of exploratory
  testing, a GLP compliance statement should be included in the study report to
  indicate this.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <i><b>Comment</i>:</b>  It is not clear what constitutes separate studies and what
  studies could be included under a single protocol.  Specifically, is a test system
  located in several  different geographical locations a single study or would each
  location by means of its particular requirements need to be a separate study?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The protocol defines what the study entails.  Therefore, if the
  test
  system for a specific study is located in different geographical locations, the protocol
  will describe the study as being located at the different sites.  EPA is adding the
  phrase "at one or more test sites" to the definition of "study" to clarify the intent that
  more than one field site may be included in one study.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii)  <i><b>Comment</i>:</b>  The proposed definition of study would imply that each
  determination such as stability, solubility, octanol water partition coefficient, volatility,
  persistence, and other data point determinations would be separate studies with
  concomitant requirements such as protocols and quality assurance unit (QAU)
  inspections. <p>
  
       <i><b>Response:</i></b>  EPA intends that QAU inspections as listed in  160.35 be
  conducted at intervals adequate to ensure the integrity of the study for each
  determination such as stability, solubility, octanol water partition coefficient, volatility,
  persistence, and other data point determinations.  However, if done as part of a
  larger study, then these determinations are covered under the larger study's protocol
  or standard operating procedure (SOP).  If they are submitted to EPA as studies unto
  themselves, then they do require their own protocols.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <i><b>Comment</i>:</b>  An experiment such as product chemistry which does not
  involve a test system cannot be considered a "study" and therefore would not be
  covered by GLP standards.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  Studies designed to determine the physical or chemical
  characteristics of a test substance are included within the scope of these regulations. 
  Therefore, EPA intends to include product chemistry experiments in the definition of
  "study."  This change is consistent with the definition of the term "study" as it now
  appears, and as it appears in the TSCA GLP standards at 40 CFR Part 792.  In the
  case of product chemistry experiments, the test substance itself may be the test
  system.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       v) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The addition of the term "or in the environment" to the
  definition of "study" indicates that the change extends the proposed regulations to
  field studies.  While it is necessary to ensure the validity of all data collected, the
  variety and special requirements of field research have not been addressed in the
  new rules<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  These regulations are intended to apply to all studies required
  to be submitted under FIFRA, including those conducted in the field.  EPA recognizes
  that field studies vary and have special requirements, but believes that the
  development of protocols and SOPs by the testing facility provides adequate flexibility
  in this respect.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Why are metabolism, product performance, environmental
  and
  chemical fate, persistence and residue listed in the definition of "study", but not
  toxicology data or data to assess hazards and product chemistry.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  The list is not meant to be limiting in any way.  Data to assess
  toxicology, hazards and product chemistry are included under "effects" and "other
  characteristics" under the new definition of "study".<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  "Prospectively" should not be deleted from the definition
  of
  study.  If the essence of GLPs requires a carefully planned study and the proposed
  rule is very strict about documentation that must be completed prior to the
  experimental start date, how can the GLP standards also apply to studies that were
  generated without a protocol or advance planning, such as epidemiology.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with the comment.  The term prospectively is
  deleted because EPA wishes all studies including epidemiological studies where past
  exposure to a study population is determined or estimated retrospectively, to be
  performed under GLP standards.  EPA recognizes that in such studies data used
  may not have been generated in conformance with FIFRA GLP standards.  However,
  it is EPA's position that the epidemiological study itself can be conducted and
  submitted to EPA in accordance with the GLP standards.  Retrospective aspects of
  such studies that are not performed according to GLP standards, for example, test
  system treatment, should be identified in the compliance statement submitted with
  the study report.<p>
  
       In addition, the types of studies potentially not covered by these regulations
  were expanded in the definition of "study" to include experiments involving test
  methods. <p>
  
  <p>
  
  (g) <i>Study initiation and completion date</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should delete the definition of "study initiation date" and
  "study completion date,"  since these terms were not defined in the 1983 GLP
  standards.  The dates will be included in the protocol and final report and do not need
  further emphasis. <p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that it is necessary to define the terms to
  differentiate them from "experimental start and termination" dates.  These terms
  indicate the dates on which specific milestones occur during a study.  The definition
  is necessary to clarify EPA's requirements, and to ensure consistency with FDA's
  GLP regulations (52 FR 33780).<p>
  
       The phrase "close of the study" as used in  160.33(f), and the phrase "study
  is completed" as used in  160.195(b)(3) both refer to the "study completion date." 
  Therefore, as of the study completion date: (1) Under  160.33(f), the study director
  must ensure that all raw data, documentation, protocols, specimens, and final reports
  are transferred to the archives; (2) after this date under  160.185(c), corrections or
  additions to the final report must be in the form of an amendment by the study
  director under the procedures specified in that section; and (3) in the applicable
  situations described in  160.195(b)(3), records must be maintained for a period of
  at least 2 years following the study completion date.<p>
  
       Furthermore, the phrase "study is initiated" as used in  160.31(a), and the
  phrase "study was initiated" as used in  160.35(b)(1) would refer to the "study
  initiation date."  Therefore, as of the study initiation date: (1) Under  160.31(a), the
  testing facility management  would designate a study director; (2) under 
  160.35(b)(1), the study would be entered on the master schedule sheet by the QAU;
  and (3) under  160.120(b), after this date all changes or revisions in the protocol
  would be documented, signed by the study director, and dated.  EPA also expects
  that as of the study initiation date, under  160.31(e), the testing facility management
  would have ensured that personnel, resources, facilities, equipment, material, and
  methodologies are available as scheduled.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  (h) <i>Test system</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  What constitutes the "test system" in tests of pre-emergent
  herbicides, soil pesticides, and product chemistry studies?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The definition of "test system" includes the statement that it is
  "* * * any * * * chemical or physical matrix * * *", including subparts thereof that are
  treated with the test, control, or reference substance and also appropriate
  components of the system that are not treated.  Therefore, test systems may include
  the soils that pesticides are applied to, and in the case of product chemistry, the test
  system may be the test substance itself.<p>
  
       EPA is including the term "reference," which was inadvertently omitted from
  the definition as it appeared in the proposed rule.  In addition, EPA is replacing "e.g."
  in the parenthetical with "including but not limited to" in order to clarify that it is not
  our intent for the list to be all encompassing.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  (i) <i>Vehicle</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The definition of "vehicle" serves to clarify the GLP
  standards, but
  there has been no confusion based on the current standards and this change is
  contrary to EPA's stated objective of being consistent with FDA's GLP regulations. <p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that clarification is needed.  The EPA GLP
  standards cover a larger number of types of studies and the need for clarification of
  the meaning of potentially ambiguous terms is greater.<p>

  <b><i>B. Organization and Personnel</b></a><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
  1. <i>Testing Facility Management</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The specific requirement to document the replacement of the
  study director as raw data should be retained.  The "master schedule" should not be
  considered "raw data" as was indicated in the preamble (52 FR 48923) to the
  proposed rule.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA deleted the requirement that the replacement of a study
  director must be documented as "raw data" to conform to the revised FDA GLP
  regulations.  This is because replacement of the study director must be  reflected on
  the master schedule sheet, which is a study record that must be retained. <p>
  
       In addition, the term "reference" which was inadvertently omitted in the
  proposed rule, has been added to  160.31(d).<p>
  
  <p>
  
  2. <i>Study Director</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Archiving the study records within a "reasonable period" after
  the
  study completion date, instead of at the close of he study as required by  160.33(f)
  would not impact on the integrity of the records.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that the requirement that all raw data,
  documentation, protocols, specimens, and final reports be transferred to the archives
  at a definitive time, i.e., the study completion date, is necessary.  This assures an
  intact audit trail for the study.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  3. <i>Quality assurance unit</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  A QAU that is entirely separate from and independent of the
  personnel engaged in the conduct of the study creates an unjustified financial burden
  on some facilities.  In some cases it would be impossible to establish a completely
  independent QAU with qualified personnel.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  As stated in the proposed rule (52 FR 48920), EPA does not
  require the QAU to be a fixed, permanently staffed unit whose only functions are to
  monitor the quality of a study.  EPA is only concerned that there be a distinct
  separation of duties between those personnel involved with the conduct or direction
  of a study and those personnel performing quality assurance on the same study. 
  Therefore,  160.35(a) prohibits personnel from performing quality assurance
  activities on their own study.  The regulations allow a study director for a particular
  study to serve as a part of the QAU or as the QAU for a different study.  FDA noted
  (52 FR 33771) that it was aware that many small laboratories could not afford the
  operation of a permanently staffed QAU.  EPA would like to point out that in those
  situations where there are different individuals performing the quality assurance
  functions for different studies, each individual is required to maintain that portion of
  the master schedule sheet which relates to the study being monitored.  For this
  reason, EPA agrees with the FDA's conclusion that the separation of functions on a
  study-by-study basis, as permitted in the existing and revised regulations, would
  provide effective quality assurance.  In view of the potential gain to management, to
  sponsors, and to EPA, through the added assurance of well-conducted studies, the
  increased costs are thereby justified.  EPA believes that its intent is more clearly
  indicated by the changes now being made.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <i><b>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should delete the requirement to index the master
  schedule by test substance, and the QAU should only be required to index the master
  schedule to facilitate retrieval of the information monitored.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  EPA acknowledges that a test facility may have several studies
  in progress on each test substance that is listed on the master schedule sheet. 
  However, EPA  concludes that deleting the requirement to index by test substance
  would be inappropriate, since the master schedule sheet is the mechanism through
  which the QAU can assure management that the facilities are satisfactory and there
  are adequate numbers of competent personnel available to perform the scheduled
  tasks.  Furthermore,  160.31(e) requires that management assure that study
  materials (e.g., test substances) are available as planned.  Therefore, elimination of
  this requirement would hinder a major function of the master schedule sheet and
  hamper the conduct of a critical management role.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Laboratory management should have the discretion to
  determine who enters the data into the master schedule, as long as the required
  information is listed.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that management retains such discretion since it
  is involved in determining the composition of the QAU and it provides an adequate
  number of such personnel ( 160.31(c) and (e)).  The QAU is distinguished by
  training that ensures that QAU functions are properly conducted.  As stated above,
  study personnel may belong to the QAU as long as they are not performing the QAU
  functions associated with studies they are involved in.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Do all studies conducted by an analytical laboratory have
  to
  be listed on a master schedule, or just those studies that will be, or likely be,
  submitted to EPA?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The GLP standards specifically exempt many product
  chemistry
  studies as described in  160.135.  The master schedule need only list those
  analytical chemistry studies that will be or will likely be submitted to EPA.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       v) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The requirement for inspection of each study under 
  160.35(b)(3) regardless of duration is excessive for the quality assurance needed to
  address study integrity, especially where studies are performed by highly
  standardized procedures.  The repetitive inspection of these types of studies would
  consume large amounts of time for both the study personnel and QAU staff.  Auditing
  each study is not necessary to ensure the work is conducted in compliance with the
  regulations.  Random sampling procedures should be allowed in selecting studies
  and phases of studies to inspect to decrease the work load and resource
  requirements of the QAU.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  EPA does not believe that a random inspection program
  would
  be an appropriate method of evaluating a study.  Generally, random sampling
  provides an adequate means of quality control where analysis involves repetition or
  identical procedures.  However, any assumption that the conduct of one phase of
  one study would be representative of another would be invalidated by the differences
  among study personnel and the operations they conduct.  Furthermore, this
  requirement is not intended for all routine studies.  Section 160.35(b) is among the
  exclusions for chemical and physical characterization studies as listed in 
  160.135(b).<p>
  
       In conformance with the revised FDA GLP regulations (52 FR 33780), EPA
  modified the requirements of  160.35(b)(3) to provide for inspections of a study on
  a schedule adequate to ensure the integrity of the study.  The changes to this section
  will allow the QAU the necessary latitude to adjust its monitoring activities to meet
  the individual needs of each study.  However, each study, no matter how short, must
  be inspected at least once while in progress.  EPA expects that by allowing the QAU
  flexibility in designing a reasonable inspection schedule, the goal of ensuring the
  quality of the study can be best achieved.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA indicates in the preamble to the proposed rule (
  160.35(e), (52 FR 48923)) that all QAU records will now be routinely available to
  inspectors.  Existing GLP standards treat certain QAU records as confidential, and
  explicitly state that the only QAU records to be reviewed by EPA auditors would be
  the master schedule (e.g., the inspection dates, study inspected, the phase or
  segment of the study inspected and the name of the individual performing the
  inspection).  If QAU records for findings and corrective action are available on an
  auditor's request, QAUs would lose their effectiveness.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  EPA shares the concerns of the commenters that access to all
  parts of a QAU inspection would weaken the inspection system, and recognizes the
  need to maintain a degree of confidentiality.  Therefore, records of findings and
  problems, as well as records of corrective action recommended and taken, are
  exempt from routine EPA inspections, except under special circumstances as
  indicated in  160.15.  However, EPA maintains that all other reports and records
  must be easily accessible and made available to EPA and FDA inspectors when
  requested as indicated in  160.35(c).<p>

  1. <i>General</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Outdoor testing facilities should not be under GLP
  standards
  since: (a) Outdoor test facilities will be conducting studies according to approved
  protocols; (b) ensuring suitability is highly subjective based on the diverse number
  of possible locations; (c) there is a concomitant lack of clear standards for
  determining suitability of locations.  Procedures must be specified by EPA regarding
  the determination of suitability for locations, testing facilities, etc.<p>
  
       Despite best efforts, the choice could always be subject to criticism and even
  criminal liability based on a good faith Compliance Statement indicating GLP
  standards had been followed.  Most outdoor testing is done to mimic normal
  agricultural conditions which are specific for the test substance and use being
  proposed.  Therefore, the determination of whether the size, construction or location
  of a facility is suitable for a study is a technical issue, and is not within the scope of
  the GLP regulation and would  be considered in the experimental design of the
  protocol.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  In cases where an EPA-approved protocol establishes test
  locations, that protocol would satisfy GLP requirements.  EPA considers any site to
  be the testing facility wherever testing is undertaken to generate data required to be
  submitted to EPA.  The conditions required by the protocol are not necessarily
  conducive to artificial manipulation in the field, or to other outdoor testing facilities. 
  Therefore, ensuring the suitability of the location of these types of testing facilities is
  both a valid and necessary part of protocols approved by EPA.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The design of the individual scientist could be dictated by
   160.41 since a "testing facility" (definition from  160.3) means "a person who
  actually conducts a study * * *"  The term "test site" should be defined to refer to the
  actual location of a given "test system."  "Testing facility" could then be used as
  currently defined and refer to an individual (mobile development scientist or scientist
  working from a testing farm facility).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The definition of "person" in this Part refers to the legal entity
  responsible for testing, including organizational units.  Consequently, it does not
  specifically indicate an individual scientist.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  2. <i>Test system care facilities</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Instead of expanding the original document to fit all test
  systems, the old rules should be left as is, and a statement added to cover non-animal test
  systems.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with the comment and believes that specific
  changes of the old rule are necessary to avoid ambiguity concerning the meaning of
  non-animal systems.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.43(a)(2) and (b), (e), (f), (g) and (h) should be
  deleted because EPA has already stated that these GLP requirements will be
  applicable to all types of testing.  It is not necessary to add the four new paragraphs
  detailing specific requirements of environmental conditions for aquatic organisms and
  plants.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that some test systems, e.g. aquatic, are unique,
  and for the sake of clarity, they require special treatment in the regulations.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <i><b>Comment:</i></b>  Field studies should be exempted because isolation is not
  possible in these types of studies.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees and believes that inclusion of field studies
  poses
  no unusual burden, since the separation is only required to be "as needed" to ensure
  "proper separation."  If the procedures used are justifiable based on experimental
  design and documented, then this requirement is met.  "Proper separation" in a field
  study may mean simply that only one crop is planted in the same subplot.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The change in  160.43(c) is appropriate but the current
  wording does not require separate disease handling facilities in every case.  The
  proposed change has merit in clarifying the options available to laboratories and the
  change promotes harmony between EPA and FDA GLP  regulations.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees with the comment.  In  160.43(c), EPA is deleting
  the requirement that separate areas be provided in all cases for the diagnosis,
  treatment, and control of test system diseases.  Instead, a change is made so that
  separate areas are provided "as appropriate."  This change is consistent with the
  September 4, 1987, revised FDA GLP regulations and the revised TSCA GLP
  regulations.<p>
  
       EPA has made this change to allow laboratories the option of disposing of
  diseased test systems without also bearing the expense of maintaining separate
  areas in testing facilities for diagnosis, treatment, and control of disease. 
  Additionally, EPA recognizes that the diagnosis and treatment requirements of 
  160.43(c) may not be appropriate when dealing with such test systems as soil,
  plants, or microorganisms.  However, if the decision is made not to dispose of the
  test system, test system care facilities, as specified in  160.43(c), must be provided.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  3. <i>Test system supply facilities</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The first sentence in  160.45(a) should be changed so that
  plants and plant materials are covered in this section.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that since plants and plant materials are covered
  in  160.45(b), including them in  160.45(a) in unnecessary.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Change  160.45(b) by deleting it or expanding it to include
  tests not confined to the indoor laboratory or greenhouse.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees with the comment and is expanding the wording
  of
   160.45 to emphasize that this section is not intended to be confining.  Therefore,
   160.45(a) is changed to read "* * * areas where the test systems are located * * *,"
  and  160.45(b) is changed to read "* * * (included but not limited to fields,
  greenhouses,* * *)."<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The addition of the two new paragraphs outlining plant
  and
  aquatic facilities to  160.45(b) is unnecessary.  These considerations are addressed
  in  160.41 with the requirement that testing facilities be of suitable construction "to
  facilitate proper conduct of studies."<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA maintains that testing facilities as mentioned in  160.41
  and test system supply facilities as mentioned in  160.45, are not the same and
  must be addressed separately.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should delete  160.45(b) introductory text, (b)(1),
  (b)(2),
  and (c) because this information was adequately covered in  160.45(a) and in
   160.43, and the facilities they refer to will be addressed in study protocol.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA maintains that  160.43 (test system care) is different from
   160.45 (test system supply facilities) and must therefore be treated separately.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  4. <i>Facilities for handling test, control, and reference substances</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  These requirements would severely  restrict the ability of
  efficacy investigators to test their product, since  160.47 would require separation
  of facilities for test animals and testing material.  The real issue for efficacy testing
  is test substance accountability which should be a vital part of the efficacy testing
  protocol, and appropriate records maintained to verify test substance accountability.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA notes that similar concerns were raised by commenters
  regarding the 1983 rule.  The wording "as necessary" was included then to allow
  latitude in facility design and operation.  EPA agrees that other measures, i.e.
  protocol, SOPs, and appropriate records, must be adequate to demonstrate the
  integrity of test, control, and reference substances during handling.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Would it be necessary to provide separate sink facilities or
  separate rooms for mixing of the test, control, and reference substances or for
  adding water to tank sprayers?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Separate areas are required for receipt, mixing and storage of
  test, control, and reference substances and their mixtures as necessary to prevent
  contamination or mixups.  The same sink could be used for all work involving mixing
  provided that the procedures (SOPs) used are adequate to prevent contamination
  and mixups.  Separate areas for receipt and storage and for mixing and storage of
  test, control, and reference substances as required in  160.47(a)(1), (2), and (3)
  does not mandate the use of separate rooms.  The areas could be in the same room
  provided there is adequate space and equipment to provide that contamination and
  mixup do not occur.  This determination should be made on a case-by-case basis.<p>

  <b><i>D. Equipment</b></a><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
  1. <i>Maintenance and calibration of equipment</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The entire section  160.63(b), requires unnecessary
  documentation and/or is vague about what is required, especially for field portions
  of residue studies.  Equipment used in these studies may only be used on an
  occasional basis, and routine inspection should only be "before use."  Requiring
  calibration and maintenance logs for all equipment involved in generating a residue
  sample would be prohibitive, would often be forgotten or overlooked and would then
  be a cause for not meeting audits.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:  </b>The requirement states that equipment shall be "adequately
  inspected, cleaned and maintained" and "adequately tested, calibrated, and/or
  standardized."  This requirement is not changed from the old rule.  The laboratory
  has latitude in defining in its SOPs what is "adequate" unless given specific guidance
  otherwise (i.e. in test rules or testing guidelines).  However, EPA recommends that
  calibration and maintenance records be available for all equipment used in field
  studies.  This includes  equipment used only rarely and rental equipment.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  It is better to designate in  160.63(b) that repair and
  maintenance will be performed by "qualified personnel," than to require that a person
  be designated in the written SOP.  The requirement for written SOPs in  160.63(b)
  causes problems since at many laboratories the equipment used in conducting a
  study is shared by a number of individuals and the care and maintenance of the
  equipment is also shared.  In the event of equipment failure, a number of laboratory
  personnel may be capable of repairing or correcting a problem, or in more serious
  equipment failures, a service representative of the manufacturer may be called.  It
  is therefore difficult and very inefficient to designate specific people to perform each
  specific maintenance and repair operation.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The definition of "person" as it appears in  160.3(h) is not
  limited
  to an individual scientist or technician, but includes an organizational subunit. 
  Consequently, the SOP that designates the "person responsible" will be designating
  a subunit of the testing facility, which could be one or several individuals.  This view
  is consistent with FDA's (52 FR 33774) interpretation and definition of "person." 
  Where duties are delegated in the SOPs, all contingencies may be addressed,
  including the contracting of service personnel.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Certain pieces of equipment such as tractors, land
  preparation
  and land measuring devices should be exempt from the calibration requirement, as
  should standard commercially available laboratory ware, such as graduated cylinders,
  beakers, flasks, etc.  Only equipment directly related to application of the test
  substance, such as sprayers or granular applicators should be listed as requiring
  calibration.  Therefore,  160.63(c) is not appropriate for field studies. <p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that calibration should be required for the
  application phase of field studies.  However, the method of calibration, and hence the
  exact equipment to be calibrated, are not specified in GLP standards, as long as the
  methods and records ensure the quality and integrity of the study.  Some equipment,
  such as graduated cylinders and volumetric flasks are pre-calibrated and do not need
  to be recalibrated.  Equipment directly related to the application of the test substance
  may require calibration, but application rates may include other parameters.  The
  methods used to measure all parameters inherent in the determination of application
  rates would have to be adequately calibrated in order to ensure the quality and
  integrity of the study.<p>

  <b><i>E. Testing Facilities Operation</b></a><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
  1. <i>Standard operating procedures</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <i><b>Comment</i>:</b>  There are few standardized tests available to researchers
  related to novel microbial pesticides.  An experimental use permit is  required for the
  evaluation of certain microbials at an earlier stage of research than is required for
  chemical evaluations.  Therefore, it would be very cumbersome to require written
  SOPs for microbial pesticides, since the methodology may be in a state of flux.  It
  may only be possible to develop SOPs following the completion of a study.  If
  methods of application and assessment need to be modified for each microbial
  developed, it would be best to affirm that methods development could be performed
  in accordance with accepted scientific standards without having SOPs as described
  in  160.81.  EPA is encouraged to take a flexible, case-by-case approach to
  establishing appropriate GLP standards for a given set of experiments concerning
  development of microbial pesticides.  Allowances could be made for situations in
  which SOPs are inappropriate, such as in the early stages of field work.  These
  allowances made in advance of the work, could then be positively affirmed as good
  laboratory practice, rather than as tolerated, non-compliance with GLP standards. 
  This would alleviate the uncertainty of performing experiments in a scientifically
  sound fashion, without knowing until the conclusion of the work whether the data
  would be acceptable to EPA.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees that there are special problems associated with the
  early stage of method development.  Method development phases of an experiment
  are not under GLP standards as has been clarified in the definition of "study" in 
  160.3.  SOPs are thus required for those operations in which all steps have been
  worked out.  However, SOPs are needed to ensure the quality and integrity of all
  studies performed under GLP standards, for instance, after the method has been
  developed.  There is flexibility in relation to SOPs insofar as changes can occur
  during the study as long as they are authorized by the study director (and
  management, if the changes are significant) and documented with raw data. 
  Furthermore, methodology that is not generalized or established sufficiently to be
  included in SOPs can be defined in the study protocol.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Although unchanged from the old rule, the second half of
   160.81(a) should not apply in some cases.  The justification for this is as follows:
  (a) Unforeseen circumstances cannot be authorized; (b) minor deviations do not
  need authorization by the study director; (c) people who conduct the studies are
  required to be appropriately trained and are able to make decisions if necessary to
  deviate from the SOPs; (d) in field studies, deviations from SOPs will occur before
  the researcher is able to consult with the study director; (e) decisions about
  deviations from SOPs that are made by field personnel would be based on standard
  agricultural practices.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with the suggestion that some deviations do
  not
  require authorization by the study director.  It is necessary for the study director to
  authorize deviations from SOPs to ensure that these  deviations do not have an
  adverse impact on the study.  SOPs should be written with sufficient flexibility to
  accommodate field studies by anticipating conditions under which appropriate actions
  must be taken without the need for authorization by the study director.  Standard
  agricultural practices can be referenced in SOPs as long as this does not lead to
  ambiguity concerning appropriate action to be taken in a given situation.   If SOPs
  state the constraints on action and a decision is made within these limits, there is no
  deviation.  This is in concert with FDA's GLP regulations (52 FR 33774) which require
  that the study director make certain that specified procedures are followed and that
  all modifications to the procedures in the approved study plan are documented and
  approved.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Some of the examples of required SOPs provided in
   160.81(b) are not applicable to all test systems or study types.  For example, "test
  room preparation" would not be appropriate when conducting field residue trials, and
  "necropsy of test system or postmortem examination of test systems," would not
  apply to studies using a chemical or physical matrix as the test system (sterile water,
  soil, agricultural fields).  Furthermore,  160.81(c) states that, "Each laboratory or
  other study area shall have immediately available manuals and SOPs relative to the
  laboratory or field procedures being performed."<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees that the term "room" in  160.81(b)(1) is
  inappropriate to many studies and is changing the word to "area" in order to clarify
  that field studies are included.  EPA believes that  160.81(b) should apply in all
  cases since the purpose of SOPs is to insure the quality and integrity of the data
  generated in the course of a study as stated in  160.81(a).  However, procedures
  that are not necessary to be performed, such as necropsy in the case of field studies,
  do not require SOPs.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The term "test systems" should not replace "animals" in
   160.81(b)(6) and (7).  Although this requirement is useful for preventing or slowing
  autolysis for toxicology studies, for other studies, such as metabolism, addressing the
  handling of moribund or dead test systems is not appropriate.  In these types of
  studies, if a test system were moribund or dead, the testing guidelines require the
  part of the study that was impacted to be repeated, and this requirement is only
  applicable to animals.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with the comment.  This rule applies to plants
  as
  well as animals.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       v) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Published literature (e.g., ASTM methods) should be
  acceptable in  160.81(c) as an appropriate part of an SOP and not just as a
  supplement to a written SOP.  The written SOP could incorporate the published
  literature by reference, without having to rewrite the entire procedure.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees that it would not be appropriate to rewrite
  published
  literature, hence the allowance for SOPs to use it as supplements.  The SOPs are
  still needed to  establish the relationship of the method to data collection procedures
  and needs in the laboratory.  While the resulting SOP would still have to be written,
  it would in effect be abbreviated in that all of the methodology referenced would not
  need to be rewritten.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  2. <i>Animal and other test system care</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.90(a) should be deleted since the subject is
  covered in  160.81(b).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA recognizes that  160.81(b) requires testing facilities to
  establish SOPs for animal and other test system care.  Section 160.90(a), however,
  expressly specifies that SOPs shall also cover test system housing, feeding and
  handling.  This section is consistent with FDA's GLP regulations and is not an
  additional requirement.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.90(b) should be simplified to provide that test
  systems be evaluated prior to use but not necessarily isolated.  For some studies,
  such as plant metabolism, isolating the plants or soil is not appropriate.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees.  Isolation is necessary to insure that a test
  system is free from disease or other conditions that may impact the study.  Further,
  the inclusion of this is consistent with FDA's GLP regulations.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The evaluation of certain test systems according to
  "acceptable * * * scientific practice" creates some difficulty, particularly for plants,
  microorganisms, soil, and water, since such practices are not defined.  "Acceptable"
  should be deleted regarding scientific practice and the requirement be only that a
  scientific basis be used in determining appropriateness for testing.  In this way,
  testing facilities would not need to justify or prove their basis to be "acceptable" in ill-defined
  areas or those in flux.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees that the term "acceptable scientific practice" may
  not
  be definable when method developments are in flux.  The term "acceptable" is
  retained, but the term "scientific practice" is changed to "scientific methods."  This
  change preserves EPA's intent that rigorous scientific methodology be used without
  implying that rigid practices be adhered to where they may not appropriately exist.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The requirement under  160.90(c) that the test area be
  disease-free prior to study initiation is inappropriate for field studies since it would be
  impossible to declare areas totally disease free under field conditions.  Also, one of
  the objectives of performing studies in the field is to conduct the studies under
  representative environmental conditions which includes encountered disease and
  insect pressures, making this part in direct conflict with the study objective.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The requirement is for the test system to be "free of disease or
  condition that interfere with the purpose or conduct of the study."  The current
  wording  therefore provides sufficient latitude for field studies.  Furthermore, EPA
  does not intend compliance with this provision to require deviation from accepted
  agricultural practices.  If disease and insect pressures are considered to be an
  integral part of a study, they clearly do not interfere with the purpose and conduct of
  that study.  The test system would therefore not need to be free of them.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       v) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.90(c) should be deleted since the effect of
  corrective treatment cannot be accounted for in test results.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that while the effects of corrective actions taken
  to isolate and treat disease or signs of disease may complicate interpretation of test
  results, so might the effects of the disease itself.  This requirement for field studies
  is not inconsistent with its inclusion for laboratory, i.e., toxicology, studies.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Markings which identify animals individually, rather than
  the
  group as required by  160.90(d), are needed in many studies with warm-blooded
  vertebrates in pens, or in the field.  For example, precocial young of avian species
  should be marked individually.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Specific criteria for marking of individuals to meet study
  requirements should be addressed separately in the protocol of the study.  The
  requirement in  160.90(d) addresses the need that test systems be adequately
  identified to prevent confounding with other test systems.  Identification of precocial
  birds, for example, may be outlined in the study protocol.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The proposed multispecies housing under  160.90(e)(1) is
  redundant to proposed  160.43(a)(1) and is inconsistent with EPA's desire to
  streamline GLP standards.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with the conclusion that these sections are
  redundant.  While  160.43(a)(1) states that the facilities shall be sufficient to allow
  proper separation of species,  160.90(e)(1) refers specifically to test system care
  within the facilities.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       viii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Field studies should be exempt from the periodic testing
  requirement of  160.90(g).  A bioassay or chemical analysis prior to study initiation
  should suffice to show that contaminants are not present at levels capable of
  interfering with the study.  The need for prior analysis may even be obviated by
  documentation of the previous history of pesticide use in the soil according to
  Standard Evaluation Procedures to ensure that no interfering contaminants are
  present.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response</i>:</b>  The regulations as written do not require that periodic tests be
  performed during a study unless there are "contaminants known to be capable of
  interfering with the study and reasonably expected to be present at levels above
  those specified in the protocol."  If there is no reasonable expectation that a problem
  exists, periodic testing is not needed.  An acceptable method to determine this, such
  as evaluation of the history of pesticide use,  should be defined in the protocol or
  SOPs.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ix) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The requirement in  160.90(j) for acclimatization of plants
  and
  animals should be deleted, since it is not defined and promotes confusion.  Animal
  toxicology tests would be subject to isolation and separately to acclimatization. 
  Organisms in environmental studies will have been isolated with their health status
  being evaluated per  160.90(b) and acclimatization would have already been
  performed as part of the process.  This part should be amended to indicate that test
  organisms be acclimatized to all experimental conditions except the test substance.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that the term acclimatization has common
  meaning
  that is clear in the context of its usage in the regulation.  Acclimatization implies
  accustoming to experimental, i.e., environmental, conditions other than the actual
  introduction of the effect (e.g., test substance) to be measured in the experiment. 
  If acclimatization is achieved during the process of isolation, it should be so stated
  in the protocol and does not require additional technical effort.<p>
  
       In addition, the term "organisms" in  160.90(j) has been changed to
  "systems."  This change is consistent with the intended expansion of GLP standards
  and was an inadvertent omission in the proposed rule.<p>

  <b><i>F. Test and Control Substances</b></a><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
  1. <i>Test, control, and reference substance characterization</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Requiring stability and solubility before testing would result
  in
  a costly burden to the efficacy testing sponsor.  The solubility testing portion of this
  requirement would not cause significant problems, but requiring stability testing to be
  completed before study initiation could result in significant time and cost burdens.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  It is more costly to have to repeat a study because of
  inadequate
  solubility or stability in respect to experimental needs.  EPA agrees, however, that
  requiring stability testing to be completed before study may result in unnecessary
  delays and is allowing concurrent stability testing.  Therefore, EPA has changed the
  requirement to allow stability testing concurrently with the study.  Solubility, where
  this is relevant to a study, must still be known before the experimental start date. 
  Please note that the 1983 GLP standards require determination of characteristics
  which will appropriately define the test or control article before study initiation.  Thus
  solubility determination before a study, where it is relevant to the study and hence an
  appropriate characteristic, is not a new requirement.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The term "purity" should be expanded to include
  radiochemical
  purity since further definition is needed to encompass metabolism/environmental fate
  studies  conducted with radioactive materials.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Radiochemical purity is covered under "other characteristics
  which appropriately define the test, control, or reference substance."  It is not
  necessary to specifically list this characteristic.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  What level of analysis constitutes "appropriate"
  characterization?  Is quality control batch analysis sufficient?  Is it necessary to fully
  characterize technical materials to 0.1%?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The details of what "appropriately" defines the test substance
  is
  a guideline or protocol issue that cannot be specified in a generic document such as
  GLP standards.  The appropriate level of characterization is largely dependent on the
  nature of the study that the substance is to be used for.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  What needs to be characterized, the technical grade active
  ingredient or the end product?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The test substance needs to be characterized.  If the test
  substance is the end product, the end product needs to be characterized.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       v) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The characterization requirement is inappropriate since it
  conflicts with management responsibilities, is costly, and adds unnecessary delays
  to the development process.  It removes a necessary option of planning by objectives
  that responsible business management must retain.  Delays and rescheduling, which
  may result if inadequate work is permitted by management, are real consequences
  that must be accepted by management, and management must decide whether or
  not to risk beginning an experiment prior to doing characterization studies.  Since the
  ultimate validity of a study will require that such data be obtained before the study is
  completed and as long as the sponsor can demonstrate that a study was conducted
  with authentic material, it is irrelevant when the characterization is completed.  This
  proposal is not in concert with FDA GLP regulations.  Many times prospective
  products fail to reach the marketplace due to unusual or insurmountable problems. 
  Therefore, eliminating the need for characterization of product will reduce the costs
  of products that fall out of developmental process.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Characterization is necessary to ensure integrity of studies.  It
  is
  also necessary for EPA to have characterization data available for inspectional
  purposes during ongoing studies, and thus to have this information complete at the
  beginning of the study.  Without characterization, it is not possible to know whether
  test, control, or reference substances from different batches that are used in a single
  study are in fact identical.  Adequate testing for characterization normally occurs
  during the synthesis or production of test, control, and reference substances, and
  thus should already be available before the test begins.  Consequently, having
  characterization data available should not impose an additional burden in most 
  cases.<p>
  
       EPA does agree, however, that stability testing should be allowed to be
  performed concurrently, to prevent unreasonable delays.  The sponsor will bear the
  burden of a repeated test in the case that concurrent stability testing suggests that
  the study is not valid.  For that reason, EPA is revising  160.105(b) to allow for
  concomitant determination of stability.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The last sentence of  160.105(a), relating to methods and
  fabrication, should be deleted since these may contain CBI.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  This is not a new requirement and has not posed any
  problems. 
  Inspectors are cleared to handle CBI material; any sensitive information can be
  declared CBI and treated as such.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Some EPA auditors are interpreting this section to require
  that
  the testing facility not only archive certification records concerning the purity or assay
  of an analytical standard (reference substance), but to also archive copies of the raw
  data and records generated during the certification process.  The sponsor or
  chemical supplier should only be required to archive the raw data supporting the
  certification of an analytical standard.  The testing facility need only archive a copy
  of the certification of the standard.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees with the comment, and is modifying  160.105(a)
  to
  allow for specification of the availability of the documentation supporting the
  characterization if it is not available at the testing facility.  The phrase "and such
  documentation availability shall be specified" is added to the end of the first sentence
  in  160.105(a), following the word "* * * experiment."<p>
  
  <p>
  
       viii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Many of the tests coming under the scope of the
  proposed
  GLP standards are in themselves stability studies.  Soil dissipation tests are stability
  determinations of herbicides, as are tests of microbial genetic markers for measuring
  persistence of recombinantly derived organisms.  The proposal places industry in the
  quandary of conducting stability studies prior to a stability study.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The performance tests cited cannot be considered to be
  stability
  tests under the GLP standards.  In the context described above, the persistence of
  the substance in the environment is a separately measured parameter.  However,
  when performing such tests, it is still important to know the stability of the substance
  to ensure that the measured effect was due to the effect of the test system.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ix) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Would it be acceptable to EPA if the stability knowledge is
  based on the extrapolation of the results of a short-term stability study under extreme
  conditions carried out before the experimental starting date?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Such an accelerated study would not demonstrate stability
  under
  test conditions, and could not be part of the concurrent stability testing performed in
  conjunction with a larger study.  It would be a separate study with its own protocol.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       x) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The proposed rule does not address whether quality control
  activities fall under the GLP standards.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Not all quality control activities are GLP issues.  Quality
  control
  work that is integral to the laboratory performing the study would be under GLP
  standards, but not that performed during manufacturing.  Studies as defined in this
  part are subject to GLP standards only when required to be submitted to fulfil data
  requirements.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The part related to "storage container assignment for the
  duration of the study" in  160.105(c) would be unrealistic for field studies, especially
  where storage containers may be large tanks, or delivery systems which are possibly
  not even owned by the sponsor or testing facility.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The delivery systems and tanks that are part of delivery
  systems
  are not "storage containers."  Test, control, and reference substance will, however,
  be stored before use in some container that is unique to that substance during the
  test.  This may be the container that the it comes in or that is assigned to it by the
  testing facility.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Liquids from large containers are often placed into smaller
  containers for use during the study.  Consolidation of test substance into smaller
  containers as the supply is depleted should be allowed.  These containers need not
  be retained after they are empty, since their retention does not enhance the quality
  or integrity of the data collected.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with the suggestion.  The retention of
  containers
  is necessary to ensure the integrity of the study.  This includes empty containers,
  which must be kept to verify the disposition of the test, control, and reference
  substance.  Disposal of containers adversely affects accountability.  This provision
  of the rule is not changed from the 1983 rule, but was commented on by the public
  because it may affect types of studies, such as field studies, that will now fall under
  the provisions of the rule as a result of these amendments.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xiii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  How are "studies of more than 4 weeks duration"
  specified
  in  160.105(d) defined?  They should  be defined as studies having an "in-life phase"
  of more than 4 weeks.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The term "4 weeks duration" is meant to apply to the
  experimental start and experimental termination dates.  The suggestion of using the
  term "in-life phase" is not accepted since this introduces new terminology that is not
  adequately defined.  The term "4 weeks experimental duration" replaces "4 weeks
  duration" in  160.105(d) to  clarify that the study initiation and study completion
  dates are not implied.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xiv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.105(b) and (e) do not provide necessary
  discretion to testing personnel to determine what data are needed to characterize
  stability for a substance, and how the determination is made.  The phrase "under test
  conditions" needs additional clarification, since a variety of temperature, humidity,
  moisture, and other test conditions may be encountered across the United States. 
  Routine product chemistry testing for emulsion stability, hydrolysis, photostability,
  etc., should satisfy this requirement.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The terminology "under test conditions" is ambiguous and
  may
  be misinterpreted, so EPA has decided to delete "under test conditions" from
   160.105(e) and replace it with "under storage conditions at the test site."  This may
  be adequately addressed by routine product chemistry testing as long as storage of
  the substance at the test site is in known, acceptable conditions.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.105(e) should be deleted since it was
  redundant
  with  160.113(a)(2).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees that these sections are redundant.  Section
  160.105(e) refers to test, control, and reference substances, while  160.113 refers
  to mixtures.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xvi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Knowledge of stability makes sense for long-term, but not
  short term studies because if stability is suspect then doses are made up each day
  and given or sprayed immediately.  Adequate knowledge of stability may exist from
  chemical information about the test substance.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  If a substance is known to be stable for a few days, then its
  stability is known in terms of the test requirements.  If the stability is not known, it
  must be determined, even for short term studies.  Storage stability needs to be
  known even if the material is used "immediately".  If enough information is known
  about the material to support its stability from other testing, its stability is known and
  the requirement is met.  However, theoretical stability is not considered to be
  adequate.  The method used to compensate for poor stability, such as daily mixing
  or immediate application, is addressed in guidelines rather than in GLP standards.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  2. <i>Test, control, and reference substance handling</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  If the test, control, or reference substance is inherently
  unstable, it may not be possible to "preclude deterioration."  Therefore, the regulation
  should allow for periodic evaluation of the purity of the test substance during a study
  to assure its integrity and replace it when shown to be warranted.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The intent is to prevent deterioration due to handling. 
  Periodic
  testing is allowed under  160.105(b) as changed in the final rule.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  3. <i>Mixtures of substances with carriers</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Does  160.113 require determination of uniformity, 
  stability,
  and solubility during field residue studies?  If so, does it require analyses for each
  tank preparation?  This requirement would impose a large burden on testing facilities
  performing these types of studies.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The purpose of this section is to assure that the methodology
  used to prepare the mixture is valid.  Once the methodology has been proven for a
  particular mixture, it need not be reconfirmed each time that mixture is prepared.  For
  field residue trials, there will be data submitted to EPA that support the uniformity,
  stability, and solubility of a substance in the carrier when prepared by appropriate
  methodology, i.e. according to the proposed use or label.  In such cases it may not
  be necessary to test each batch that is prepared for field application.  However, field
  residue trials do remain subject to the requirements of this section.  Where available
  data are inadequate to support uniformity, stability, and solubility in a particular case,
  then it is necessary for the data to be generated under this section.  Also, there may
  be protocol stipulations applicable to a particular study that require tank mixture
  analyses in addition to any provisions of this section.<p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The range of environmental conditions encountered in field
  trials are great and would require extensive evaluations of stability and solubility
  under numerous environmental conditions.  This amount of data could not be
  evaluated prior to study initiation.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Section 160.113(a)(2) states that determination(s) shall be "*
  * *
  under the environmental conditions specified in the protocol and as required by the
  conditions of the test."  All possible environmental conditions do not have to be
  anticipated and tested unless required in the protocol.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Short-term toxicity and field residue studies should be
  exempted from this section since supplementary analyses are performed for other
  studies with the same test substance.  The analytical cost could equal or exceed the
  cost of the remainder of the short-term study.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The GLP standards do not require characterization for each
  study.  The characterization is required for each test, control, and reference
  substance.  The same substance may need to be characterized only once, even if
  used on multiple studies.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The requirement for stability and solubility should allow
  flexibility for the sponsor to make the determination either before, during, or after the
  study.  When to determine the stability is a business decision based on knowledge
  of the risk of having to repeat a study, if the stability data negatively impacts the
  integrity of the study.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA understands that requiring stability testing to be
  completed
  prior to a study may introduce unreasonable delays.  In harmony with the modification
  of  160.105(b) to allow concurrent stability testing of test,  control, and reference
  substances,  160.113(a)(2) is changed to allow stability testing of mixtures to be
  performed concomitantly with the study.  This allows the necessary flexibility and is
  also consistent with FDA's GLP regulations.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       v) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  In the very early stages of a compound's development there
  is a need for basic acute toxicity tests.  However, there are no analytical methods
  and calibrated reference standards available to test the stability of the test
  substances in the carrier according to GLP standards.  An estimate of the stability
  of the compound in an inert carrier like starch, oil, or polyethylene glycol is possible
  and should be sufficient as a preliminary approach.  The stability test will be carried
  out as early as the analytical methods are available.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  If a carrier is used, the mixture with the carrier must go
  through
  the same test, i.e. stability, solubility, etc.  Instability of the mixture in a specific
  carrier is important since it may affect the apparent effects of the test substance.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The assurances called for in  160.113(c) are not well
  defined. 
  How would the addition of the vehicle used to facilitate mixing of the test substance
  with the carrier to the control system affect this requirement?  If the vehicle is
  identically mixed in control, is there a need to show noninterference?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Any vehicle used to facilitate mixing must be shown not to
  interfere with the study.  This includes a vehicle control to determine interaction
  effect.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  If a test substance is applied to a soil, is the soil a carrier
  or
  test system?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  This section does not generally consider "soil" to be a carrier;
  it
  is considered to be part of the test system.<p>

  <b><i>G. Protocol for and Conduct of a Study</b></a><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
  1. <i>Protocol</i>-<i>General</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The proposed regulations do not offer sufficient latitude for
  the
  generation of protocols.  The regulations state that a protocol must exist prior to
  study conduct, yet it would be almost impossible to specify the exact analyses that
  would be performed on biological samples collected in the field until the samples
  were collected.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The protocol requirement is not too restrictive to allow for
  situations where the exact analyses performed may not be known in advance.  The
  type or nature of analysis still needs to be specified in the protocol.  The protocol
  should state what samples are intended to be collected, how they are to be collected,
  and how they are intended to be analyzed.  If there is a need for latitude, (for
  instance it is not known specifically how many samples will result from a particular
  study) that should be anticipated and stated in the protocol.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.120(a)(5), (7), (10), and (11) should not apply
  to
  product chemistry experiments.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The term "test system" is redefined to include any physical
  matrix, which may thus be applicable to product chemistry studies.  However, note
  that a study designed solely for the determination of certain chemical or physical
  characteristics of a test substance are exempted from  160.120(a)(5), (7), (10), and
  (11) as described in  160.135.<p>
  
       In addition, the word "of" prior to "frequency" should be "and."  This was a
  typographical error noticed by one commenter and has been corrected in the final
  rule.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Guidance is needed in the final preamble for presenting
  addresses, as required by  160.120(a)(3), of field and environmental locations used
  to conduct tests.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The address of the testing facility is the address of the "person
  (i.e. organizational unit or subunit) who actually conducts the study.  Even if this
  organizational unit includes parts situated in different locations it may still be
  considered to have one address.  The address should be a permanent address and
  would probably be synonymous with the address of the study director and/or testing
  facility's management.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  "Address of sponsor" should be removed from this Part to
  maintain consistency with FDA GLP regulations.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA maintains that the address of the sponsor is essential to
  its
  inspectional process, which differs from that of FDA.<p>
  
       v) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The requirement in  160.120(a)(4) to state proposed
  experimental start and termination dates poses problems for field studies where
  these dates cannot be predicted with certainty.  Would this result in protocol
  deviations whenever these dates are not exactly met?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The requirement to document the proposed experimental start
  and termination dates in the protocol does not suggest that a protocol deviation
  occurs when the date is not met.  The term "proposed" signifies that this date is
  estimated.  However, gross deviation from the proposed date may be a violation of
  the protocol, if there are date-critical aspects of the study that are identified as such.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.120(a)(5) is inappropriate because: (a)
  Justification should be required only when more than one test system can be used
  in a study and not, for example, in residue chemistry studies where residue levels in
  specific target crops are the subject of a study; (b) Justification should only be
  required for those that deviate from, or fall outside the normal EPA guidelines and not
  where standard test systems (Pesticide Assessment Guidelines and Standard
  Evaluation Procedures) are used; (c) The retention of this requirement does not
  promote harmony between EPA and FDA GLP regulations.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Environmental studies are more diverse than health effects
  testing and are subject to details relevant to test system design that are more
  chemically dependent than is the case in health effects studies.  Furthermore, this
  is not seen to impose a burden in the cases described in this comment.  In the case
  where only one test system can be used, that is the justification that should be
  stated.  The targeting of a specific crop may be part of the justification and so stated;
  it is still necessary to state that the test system (e.g., strain of crop, soil, location)
  used is justified for the purpose of the study.  If a standard test system is used
  because it is the referenced system in EPA or Organization for Economic
  Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines, citing the use of such guidelines
  is sufficient justification.  Thus, detailed discussions are required only in the relatively
  few cases where the study design requires deviation or special choices to be made
  in selection of the test system.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should add "range" to  160.120(a)(6) so it reads "* *
  *
  body weight range," since without specifying range, the protocol requirement could
  be misinterpreted to mean that all individual body weights of the test system should
  be included.  This would not be possible since exact weights of test systems would
  not be known when the protocol is prepared.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA did not intend a change here and retains the term "body
  weight range" as used in the 1983 rule.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       viii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.120(a)(7) should be deleted since the test
  system will be identified and justification for its selection will be in the protocol.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Identification of the test system is not covered in any of the
  other
  parts of  160.120.  Identification is the specific description of which individual test
  system is used, not a general description of the kind of test system.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ix) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The method for controlling bias is usually in the SOP,
  therefore inclusion of a reference in the protocol to the SOP should suffice.<p>
  
       <i><b>Response:</i></b>  EPA agrees that this is allowed.  The SOP may be referred to
  in
  the protocol in such cases.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       x) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The term "nutrients" should be added to the list for the
  description of the diet used in the study to cover the use of fertilizer in plant studies.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA has incorporated this suggestion into the final rule.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.120(a)(10) should be deleted, or amended
  with
  "if appropriate" because: (a) The reason for selecting the route of administration is
  the objective of the study; (b) route of administration and reason for its choice is not
  applicable to studies such as aqueous hydrolysis and anaerobic aquatic; (c) EPA
  Pesticide Assessment Guidelines require the use of certain routes.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Unlike FDA, EPA requires many tests where a predefined
  route
  of exposure is not available.  Multiple  exposure routes may be possible for many test
  substances.  It is appropriate to state that the route is mandated by guidelines or by
  the purpose of the study if either of these are the case.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.120(a)(10) should be modified to read "* * *
  route
  of administration and/or exposure * * *" to encompass other types of protocols. <p>
  
       <i><b>Response:</i></b>  EPA disagrees with the suggestion since the experimenter
  controls administration but does not have control of the route of exposure. 
  Administration routes cover the potential of all exposure routes and hence is a more
  general, all-inclusive term in this case.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xiii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.120(a) should be reworded so it reads: "The
  route or method of administration/application and the reason for choice, if
  appropriate."<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with the suggestion.  The route of
  administration
  is not the same concept as method of application or administration.  It would not be
  appropriate to introduce statements concerning methodology to this section.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xiv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  In the case where the study director is  part of a contract
  laboratory engaged for the study by the sponsor, it should be clarified that such
  signature as required under  160.120(a)(14) does not constitute review and
  approval of those parts of the protocol not related to the work done by the contract
  lab.  For example, the study director for the chemical analysis of pesticide residues
  in plants may not be trained in the experimental design of the sponsor's overall study
  although he or she may be qualified to conduct the subpart of the study contracted
  to the laboratory.  Such a dilemma may similarly arise in  160.120(a)(5), (7), (10),
  and (15).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA believes that the study director cannot, by definition, be
  an
  individual who is not trained or cognizant of the overall study.  A study is not
  subdivided into multiple studies with multiple study directors.  The definition of "study"
  and "study director" preclude such a separation of responsibility.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xv) <i><b>Comment:</i></b>  "Where applicable" should be added to  160.120(a)(15)
  since statistical methods are not used in field studies.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Statistical methods are and should be used in field studies. 
  However, where the use of statistics is limited this can be so stated.<p>
  
       The phrase "to be used" should modify the term "statistical method" as in
   160.120(a)(16) of the 1983 rule.  This was a typographical error noted by one
  commenter and has been corrected.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xvi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.120(a)(15) is redundant since all of
   160.185(a)(3) requires statistical methods employed for analyzing the data.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Section 160.185 describes reporting requirements after the
  study, while  160.120 describes  protocol requirements before the study.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  2. <i>Physical and chemical characterization studies</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.135 is confusing and needs to be read several
  times in order to understand it.  EPA should clarify its intent by specifying those
  studies to be conducted under GLP standards, and by removing the double negatives
  currently presented in  160.135(a) and (b).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees with the comment.  The section is changed to
  eliminate the double negative and reworded for clarity while retaining the intent of the
  proposed changes.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Should exemptions also apply to "assembly line" biological
  studies, such as the Ames test, acute lethality, eye irritation, etc?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA does not intend to expand exemptions to biological tests
  previously covered by GLP standards, even when repetitive in nature. 
  Section 160.135 applies only to physical and chemical characterization studies and
  is intended to ease the burden on many studies that will now come under GLP
  standards.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The concept of what constitutes a study is blurred by this
  section.  Partial deletion of protocol requirements implies that a protocol is still
  required for these "exempted measurements."<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA intends that a protocol still be required for the partially
  exempted studies.  Some, but not all, of the full protocol requirements are eliminated.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Areas for receipt and storage of test substances have been
  deleted in  160.47(a)(1), but corresponding SOPs are still required by
   160.81(b)(3).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA maintains that SOPs for test, control and reference
  substance handling are still important, if not more important, when facilities for their
  handling are not specified.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       v) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Stability is to be known under conditions of the test under
   160.105(e), but the requirement to report that information is deleted in
   160.185(a)(5) and the requirement to determine stability is removed by deleting
   160.105(b).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees, but there is no contradiction.  The requirements
  for
  determination and reporting of stability are relaxed although stability still needs to be
  known.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  A protocol is required even though certain specific
  elements
  have been deleted ( 160.120(a)(5) through (12) and (15)), but the requirement for
  the quality assurance unit to retain the protocol is deleted ( 160.195(d)).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees that this is true.  The QAU recordkeeping
  requirements are relaxed although the protocol still needs to be written.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       vii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  A quality assurance unit is required by  160.35(a), but by
  deleting  160.31(c) management will not have to assure the existence of a QAU.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA eliminated  160.31(c) because it requires management to
  "assure that there is a quality assurance unit as described in  160.35."  This would
  have contradicted the exclusion of certain portions of  160..35 as specified (i.e.
   160.35(b) and (c)).  That which is not excluded under  160.35 must comply with
   160.35(a).<p>
  
  <p>
  
       viii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  A study director is required according to  160.12 and
  160.33, but does not have to be shown in the final report by the deletion of
   160.185(a)(10).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The study director is still required to sign the compliance
  statement submitted with the final report as required in  160.12 and is thus required
  to be named in the final report.  A number of individuals are listed in  160.185(a)(10)
  in addition to the study director.  This section was exempted to reduce reporting
  requirements. <p>
  
  <p>
  
       ix) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Studies designed to determine stability, octanol water
  partition
  coefficient, volatility, and environmental persistence (biodegradation,
  photodegradation, or chemical degradation studies) should exclude  160.43(a)(1)
  through (c) and (f) through (h), 160.45, 160.81(b)(1), (2), (6), (7), and (9), and 160.90. 
  Only the physical and chemical properties that are used to predict the environmental
  fate of a test substance should be developed in compliance with these regulations. 
  Those properties which are not clearly used for this purpose should be excluded.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA does not agree that the listed sections are irrelevant in
  their
  entirety to the listed studies.  Those portions of the sections which are plainly not
  applicable to these studies (e.g. animal care facilities) do not place any burden on
  these studies.<p>
  
       x) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The removal of physical and chemical characterization from
  the responsibilities of the QAU should not be accepted because it presents a major
  problem for the QAU personnel.  The QAU should be responsible for every study
  within the laboratory with no exception.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with the conclusion that the QAU has no
  responsibilities in physical and chemical characterization studies.  The exclusions
  reduce the responsibilities of the QAU, i.e. master schedule requirements, etc., but
  do not eliminate them.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The QAU should be responsible for looking at the
  functional
  components of the laboratory (e.g., all melting points, all GC/MS analyses, etc.)
  rather than focusing on a particular study, such as with toxicology studies.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees and is modifying the inspectional requirements of
  the
  QAU under  160.35.  This change specifies that the QAU conduct inspections and
  maintain records that are appropriate to particular studies.  This gives latitude to the
  QAU with respect to how the information is gathered; i.e., as part of the standard
  review procedures of the laboratory, or as needed for the test.  This change should
  reduce the burden in cases where  it is appropriate to maintain central records
  regarding functional components that affect several studies rather than requiring
  such records to be maintained separately.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  If physical and chemical characteristics are to be covered
  by
  GLP standards, they should not be referred to as separate "characterization studies." 
  These tests are listed in 40 CFR part 158 as physical and chemical characteristics
  and properties and are submitted to EPA in studies by Guideline series numbers, not
  necessarily as individual "characterization studies."  Additionally, in product chemistry
  many of the characteristics listed in proposed  160.135(b) are part of Series 63 (i.e.
  stability,  solubility, etc.), which is submitted as a single study.  If these
  characteristics are to be covered by GLP standards, it should only be to the extent
  of the data requirements in 40 CFR 158, because it is not the purpose of GLP
  standards to define studies for registration.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with this comment.  GLP standards do not
  expand data requirements.  The regulations only specify how the data are to be
  generated.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xiii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  All product chemistry should be exempted from these
  regulations, except for those studies specifically noted in the preamble (i.e. stability,
  solubility, octanol water partition coefficient, volatility and persistence), which also
  affect the environmental hazard assessment and/or are required by other sections
  of the guidelines.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA maintains that all data that are required to be submitted
  to
  EPA be collected according to GLP standards.  While EPA believes that a portion of
  the requirements of the previous GLP standards can be reduced for some studies,
  the standards are still important to assure the quality and integrity of the data
  generated.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xiv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The series 60, 61, 62, and 63 requirements are mainly
  process and method development type experiments, and are developed over a
  period of time with portions sometimes contributed from laboratories in plant
  locations, making it prohibitively expensive and unrealistic to have these portions
  under a GLP program<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  While there may be additional cost, the need to have the work
  performed under GLP standards overrides this concern.  EPA does not agree that
  GLP requirements in this section entail unrealistic requirements on laboratories that
  perform these types of experiments.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The data quality from the series 60, 61, 62, and 63 studies
  would not be compromised since the companies that are generating these data are
  usually doing so for their own economic benefit as well as for registration purposes.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Data developed under manufacturer's demands for quality
  control
  information do not reflect the same constraints upon data integrity as required by
  EPA.  During the manufacturing process, cost and time considerations may conflict
  with safety assessment data quality needs.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xvi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should revise PR Notice 86-5 to ensure that the
  definition of study corresponds with the definition in the GLP regulations.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The GLP regulations address the integrity of data generated
  during a study.  PR Notice 86-5 addresses the reporting of the data, which is a
  separate concern.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xvii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The term "studies" in the title of  160.135 should be
  replaced with another term, such as "experiments," to avoid the misconception that
  these experiments must be carried out as separate "studies."  As separate studies,
  they would require separate protocols, study directors, study reports, QAU audits,
  etc., when in fact these experiments are part of a larger study, which already has its
  own protocol covering all the various experiments to be performed.  It may be that
  this part should be deleted because these tests do not fit the basic definition of study
  and should not be included, in any way, under the scope of the GLP standards.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees that these tests are not studies.  The definition
  of study includes the phrase "to determine or help predict (the test substance's)
  effect * * * and fate."  Therefore the physical and chemical characterization
  parameters are included.  EPA agrees that in some cases, the determinations will
  have been performed as part of a larger study (e.g. product chemistry) and
  consequently will have been performed under the protocol of the larger study.  In
  other cases, however, each of these studies will require a separate protocol.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xviii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Are GLP requirements applicable when analyses are
  conducted by an outside laboratory, or are they exempted from the various sections
  outlined in  160.135(a)?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The location where the analyses are performed does not affect
  the applicability of the GLP regulations.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xix) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.135(a) in the proposed rule should be deleted
  because the regulation is far too complex to start applying parts of it to one study, but
  not to another.  It is a major task to instruct personnel on the requirements in the
  GLP standards; and it would be an impossible task to instruct them on multiple
  versions of GLP standards.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  There should not be many cases where the same workers will
  need to be trained in both levels of GLP interpretation.  There are not "multiple
  versions" of GLP standards, only a relaxation of some requirements for some
  studies.  EPA does not consider this to be imposing an additional burden.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xx) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Under  160.135(b), an unusual situation can occur with
  quality assurance because a QAU is required to exist by retention of  160.35(a) and
  is implied to have records of inspection by retention of  160.35(d), but has no duties
  by virtue of deleting  160.35(b) and (c).  Both  160.35(a) and (d) should be added
  to the list of excluded  provisions.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees that there are inconsistencies in eliminating
   160.35(b) and (c) since there are no inspectional responsibilities included in
   160.35(a) and (d).  Consequently, EPA is expanding  160.35(a) to include
  inspectional responsibilities.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xxi) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The repetitive inspection of the types of studies required
  in
  proposed  160.135(b) would consume large amounts of time for both study
  personnel and the QAU staff without contributing to the quality and integrity of the
  data.  The periodic inspection of such operations would provide the necessary
  assurance that the data were of sufficient quality and integrity to meet all
  requirements under GLP standards.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA disagrees with the comment and expects that each study
  be inspected by the QAU at least once.  Where these types of tests are repetitive or
  routine in nature it should be possible for the QAU inspectional process to be equally
  routine.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       xxii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should modify proposed  160.135(b) to make it
  perfectly clear that stability/solubility experiments carried out as part of a study are
  not excluded from the exemption provided by  160.135(a).  When the sole purpose
  of a study is to determine stability or solubility, GLP standards should apply, but
  where stability or solubility determinations are being made prior to the initiation of the
  actual experiment for which the study is being conducted, there is no reason to treat
  those determinations as a separate study.  The study protocol will cover the need for,
  and method of, determining stability and solubility in situations where it is necessary
  to make those determinations in order to ensure the success of the study.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees that "sole purpose" stability/solubility studies are
  under GLP standards, but disagrees that these studies should be exempt when they
  are part of another GLP study.  If they are part of a larger study, they are within its
  protocol, and hence under GLP standards.  If they are not within that protocol, then
  they are "sole studies" under GLP standards in their own right.<p>

  <b><i>H. Records and Reports</b></a><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
  1. <i>Reporting of study results</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.185 delineates the information to be included in
  the
  final report.  Since the Office of Pesticides Programs (OPP) has already designed
  Data Reporting Guidelines (DRGs) as addenda to the Pesticide Assessment
  Guidelines and these are being used by applicants, this section appears to be
  unnecessary.  Furthermore, there are a few issues where the GLP standards and
  DRGs are not compatible and illustrate a possible conflict in EPA requirements: (a)
  Section 160.185(a)(2)-(protocol)-The reviewer at OPP needs to know the study
  objectives, not necessarily what the objectives were in the protocol and what
  changes were made during the  course of the study; (b) Section 160.185(a)(6)-(methodology)- A
  description of the methods used is required, but residue chemistry
  reports require a separate report for methodology; (c) Section 160.185(c)-(report
  amendments)- Information Services Branch has specific requirements in PR 86-5
  regarding the submission of amended reports.  In cases such as these, which
  document has the superseding authority?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  DRGs are designed for presentation of data to EPA after the
  performance of the study, and GLP standards are designed to ensure data integrity
  during the performance of the study.  GLP standards require additional information
  to be contained in the final report that are not required by the DRGs.  This should not
  result in any issues of superseding authority.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Section 160.185(a)(12) should be modified to require
  reports
  only when they are necessary to explain results that are highly subject to
  interpretation or critical to the final evaluation of the study.  Otherwise this will result
  in an unusual reporting burden with little benefit during field residue studies.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA does not agree that the requirement is impractical or
  unnecessary.  This reporting requirement cannot be left entirely to the discretion of
  the study director.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  At the EPA's second data submitter' workshop on the
  implementation of PR Notice 86-5 on December 15, 1986, EPA handed out the
  "Clarification of PR Notice 86-5 Requirements" pertaining to GLP considerations. 
  EPA states in this clarification that reformatting final reports to comply with the
  submission requirements of PR Notice 86-5 does not constitute a formal "correction
  of addition" to a final report that would otherwise require the  signature of the study
  director under 40 CFR 160.185(c).<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA agrees and is incorporating the suggestion in the final
  rule
  so that modification to comply with the EPA submission requirements does not
  constitute a correction, addition, or amendment.  However, EPA advises that the
  process of formatting final study reports does not alleviate the study director of
  accountability in signing the final report or the compliance statement. <p>
  
  <p>
  
  2. <i>Storage and retrieval of records and data</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The phrase "beyond quality assurance" in  160.190(a) needs
  clarification since it could be ambiguously interpreted.  Does it mean the date of the
  final approved report or does it mean beyond initial evaluation of the specimens,
  since that was the statement used in the corresponding preamble section?<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA intends that the specimens be retained until the quality
  assurance unit assures that their discarding does not negatively impact the integrity
  of the study.  The wording is being changed to "after quality assurance verification"
  to clarify this.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Tissues and animal feeds collected from  non-toxicology
  studies should also be discarded after quality assurance verification.  If EPA does not
  intend for animal tissues to be retained from residue studies, "animal" not appearing
  after "plants" is an oversight.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  EPA did not include the term "animal" in the list since it would
  potentially include tissues and feeds from toxicology studies which must be kept.  It
  is felt that the suggested wording would not provide sufficient breadth to cover non-residue
  samples.  Therefore, EPA will require that all animal tissue samples, even
  from non-toxicology studies, be included in this Part.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  Retention time for 14C-labelled specimens needs to be
  addressed since a facility's license limit could be exceeded for storing radioactive
  material.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The problem of licensing requirements is a facility
  responsibility
  under GLP standards.  EPA does not agree that special consideration be given to
  sample storage based on the above reasoning.<p>
  
  <p>
  
       iv) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  This Part does not clearly define who must archive raw
  data
  or authenticated copies.  If the test facility's portion of the study is small compared
  to the entire project, it does not make sense to archive at the test facility.  The
  sponsor should be required to archive all raw data in support of a submission and
  provide that data to the test facility in the event of an audit.  Archiving at the test
  facility will put an undue and unnecessary hardship on small laboratory facilities. 
  Another problem to be considered is whether the test facility is required to archive the
  final report submitted to EPA.  It could find itself archiving analytical data generated
  by another facility.  Furthermore, in the event that the sponsor may be involved in a
  lawsuit concerning the study, the contingent liability exposure for the test facility
  should be clarified.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  The test facility may contract with a commercial archiver
  under
   160.195(b) and (g).  This implies flexibility in the physical location of the archives.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  3. <i>Retention of records</i><p>
  
  <p>
  
       i) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  The appropriate endpoint for specimen retention in  160.195
  should be based on the integrity of the specimens and use by the study director, or
  other technical personnel, not based on when QAU personnel may perform a review.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Quality assurance evaluation is needed to assure that the
  integrity of the data are not compromised by the decision to discard specimens.  For
  consistency, EPA is changing the wording of  160.195(c) to concur with the wording
  of  160.190(a).<p>
  
  <p>
  
       ii) <b><i>Comment</i>:</b>  EPA should explicitly state in  160.195(i) that when exact
  copies are substituted for original source as raw data, then the original may be
  discarded.  In the past, EPA inspectors have required retention of original data
  sources even if exact copies existed.  The burden imposed by some EPA auditors,
  that each  copy must be signed and dated, is unrealistic.  Verification of "batches" of
  reproduction copies is just as meaningful and would eliminate most of the
  unnecessary burden on personnel and time resources.<p>
  
       <b><i>Response</i>:</b>  Specific wording advising the discarding of raw data after
  copying
  is not necessary or useful.  "True copies" will be acceptable as raw data by EPA
  inspectors under  160.190.  Signing and dating each copy may be impractical and
  an acceptable alternative method may be devised and incorporated into standard
  operating procedures to ensure the integrity of the copies.  Laboratories are
  cautioned that discarding originals places an additional burden on verification of the
  authenticity of the copies.<p>

  <i><b>A. Executive Order 12291</b><p>
  
  </i><p>
  
       Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is "major" and
  therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.  EPA has
  determined that the amendments are not a major rule because they do not meet any
  of the criteria set forth and defined in section 1(b) of the Order.  Compliance costs
  were estimated using data from a survey of laboratories potentially affected by the
  revised GLP standards and from data on pesticides testing demand, and costs taken
  from a 1980 study of the pesticide testing industry.<p>
  
       This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for
  review as required by Executive Order 12291.  Any comments from OMB to EPA and
  any EPA response to those comments are available for public inspection at
  Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M
  St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and at the Office of Management and Budget,

  L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1165 (U.S.C. 601 et. seq.)), and it has been determined that it will
  not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses,
  small governments, or small organization.  It was found that the GLP revisions will
  not increase the costs of health effects testing and that nonhealth effects testing
  costs will increase about 20 percent.<p>
  
  <p>
  
  <i><b>C. Paperwork Reduction Act</b><p>

<c><h3><u><b>CONDUCT OF ACUTE TOXICITY STUDIES</b></u></h3></c><p>  <p>

In response to the July 1993 Pesticide Reregistration Rejection Rate Analysis for Toxicology
(EPA 738-R-93-004) and realizing labs were often having difficulty conducting acute toxicity
studies to the satisfaction of the Agency, the Precautionary Review Section (PRS) of the
Registration Division of The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) decided to do a  rejection rate
analysis on acute toxicity studies on pesticide products submitted to PRS.  The results of the
analysis are as follows:<p>

<p>

          Acute Oral Toxicity                11%<br>

          Acute Dermal Toxicity                   10%<br>

          Acute Inhalation Toxicity               23%<br>

          Primary Eye Irritation                   9%<br>            Primary Skin Irritation                
11%<br>            Dermal Sensitization                    38%<br> 
<p>

<p>

It was not determined how often each study deficiency was found. While initially PRS only
conducted a rejection rate analysis, it was later decided that information on the proper conduct on 
studies was needed.  PRS realized there were several deficiencies regularly observed in acute
toxicity studies not addressed in the previous document.   About the time PRS was developing a
document on the conduct of studies, the American Crop Protection Association (ACPA) informed
PRS they were also working on a similar document in preparation for a self-certification program
for acute toxicity studies.  On May 23, 1995, several representatives from the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), ACPA, the Chemical Producers and Distributors Association (CPDA),
the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), Health Canada and the California Department of
Pesticide Regulation (CPDR) met to discuss acceptable methods for the conduct of acute toxicity
studies.  The decisions made in that meeting were incorporated into the preliminary PRS
document to form the present document. <p>

<p>

OPP realizes that, currently, complete guidance for the proper conduct of acute toxicity studies
according to EPA policy is not found in one source, but often must be pieced together from
several different sources.  It is the goal of this document to compile this information into a
supplement to the Subdivision F Guidelines so that we may reduce the number of studies that are
rejected or flawed due to incorrect procedures or insufficient reporting. This guidance is intended
to supplement the<b> November 1984 Subdivision F Guidelines</b> on the conduct of studies. 
To insure the correct procedures are followed for acute toxicity studies, the laboratory should
follow a copy of Subdivision F Guidelines, November 1984 edition in addition to the
recommendations given in this <b>PR Notice.</b><p>

<a name="intro">
The studies of concern are those from the FIFRA Subdivision F Guidelines 81-1 through  81-6:
acute oral toxicity, acute dermal toxicity, acute inhalation toxicity, primary eye irritation, primary
dermal irritation and dermal sensitization. The intent of the six acute toxicity studies is to provide
data sufficient to allow the placement of a product into a specific toxicity category.  The toxicity
category is then used for the purposes of determining precautionary labeling. <p>   <p> 
By addressing study deficiencies observed in the past, the Agency hopes to inform laboratories
and registrants of mistakes that are found so these mistakes may be avoided in future submissions. 
OPP realizes the following list does not contain <i>all</i> possible study deficiencies that may or
may not lead to study rejection.  <p> 
<p>

If any registrant thinks that a reviewer misunderstood a study or otherwise incorrectly graded a
study, they may submit a rebuttal.  This submission should include all information pertinent to the
rebuttal: the product's registration number, the study's MRID number, the problem(s) identified by
the Agency with the study and a clear explanation of the registrant's disagreement.  Secondary
rebuttals will not be considered unless relevant information previously not provided is forwarded. 
This new information should be clarification of procedures or data, new data, product
formulations, etc.<p> 
<p>

Study deficiencies may be separated into two broad categories, general deficiencies that may be
common to many or all studies and deficiencies specific to a particular study.  Both of these
categories may include errors of conduct and/or errors of reporting.  Generally, errors in the
reporting of a study are correctable, while errors in the conduct of a study (unless they are minor)
are not.  Once a study has been improperly conducted, it is not possible to correct errors without
reconducting the study.  However, errors of reporting, although correctable, can cause an
avoidable delay in review time. <p> 
<p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment</i></u>:   A general principle that should be followed in the
review of
acute toxicity studies should be that all studies that conform to the current Subdivision F or
OECD guidelines must be acceptable as long as they allow a label category to be assigned.<p> 
</b><p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response </i></u>:  The Agency agrees.<p>

<p>
<a name="general">
<h2>I.   General Study Deficiencies </h2> <p>

<p>
<a name="sc1">
          A.   Errors in Study Conduct.</b><p>

<p>

                         1.   <i><u>Studies are submitted on a test material that is too dissimilar to the
registration product to be useful for making labeling decisions</u></i>.  When submitting studies
to support the registration of a product, it is always preferable to use studies that were conducted
on the formulation to be marketed.  When this is not possible it is advisable to submit studies on a
formulation or product that was found to be toxicologically similar either by a specific
determination of toxicological similarity or through the batching process of a Registration
Eligibility Document (RED).  It is also acceptable to "bridge" data to support one product that
was conducted on one product to support another product.  In bridging data, a registrant would
use data from a product with either toxicity category of III or IV for the acute oral toxicity, acute
dermal toxicity, acute inhalation toxicity, primary eye irritation and primary skin irritation studies
(but not the dermal sensitization study) to support another product that has a similar but more
dilute formulation.  Or, the registrant may use data from a product that has toxicity category I for
any of the five acute toxicity studies to support a category I rating for a similar but more
concentrated product. <p>

<p>

                         2.   <i><u>The test animals were previously or concurrently used in another
study, or, were used to test more than one test material at a time</u></i>.  As per the February
11, 1992 Robert P. Zendzian and  March 17, 1992 Penelope Fenner-Crisp memos on this subject,
OPP considers the reuse of test animals and the testing of multiple chemicals simultaneously on
test animals in acute toxicity studies or any other toxicology studies to be scientifically
unacceptable. <p>

<p>

                         3.  <i> <u>The test animals were unhealthy.</u></i>  The 40 CFR 160.90 (c)
states that at the beginning of a study, test systems shall be free of any disease or conditions that
might interfere with the purpose or conduct  of the study. <p>  <p> 
                         4.  <i> <u>The mortality exceeds more than one animal per sex for either sex in a
limit test</u>.</i> When there is more than one mortality per sex, the lab should test additional
dosages in order to determine an LD50. <p>  <p> 
<b><u><i>Industry Comment </i></u>:  Additional dose levels should be tested as necessary to
determine the label category (not necessarily an LD50).</b><p>  <p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response </i></u>:  The Agency agrees.</b><p>  <b>       </b><p>

                         5.   <u><i>A reduced testing scheme was used without establishing the more
sensitive sex.</i></u>  A reduced testing scheme allows testing fewer than three dose levels for
each sex.  To qualify for a reduced testing scheme in either the acute oral, acute dermal or acute
inhalation toxicity study, the laboratory must first establish whether one sex demonstrates
increased mortality to the test material.  This demonstration is preferably done via the acute oral
toxicity study.  Dose levels must be sufficient to clearly identify the appropriate toxicity category
for the test material.  <p>

<p>

                         6.   <u><i>Dose levels were not properly chosen </i></u>.  The test did not
allow the reviewer to determine the toxicity category of the study.   <p>                                <p>

                              Ideally, an acute toxicity study may be accepted if no more than one animal of
either or both sexes dies (for a total of two-out-of-ten animals) during a limit test.  The Agency
has received older acute inhalation toxicity studies that failed in their attempt to reach the 5.0
mg/L limit test concentration.  In studies of this type where 2/5 animals of one sex (and 0/5 of the
other sex) die in a 5.0 mg/L limit test, the study will be classified toxicity category III for acute
inhalation toxicity.  The registrant will be given the option of retesting (at 2.0 mg/L) to achieve
toxicity category IV for acute inhalation toxicity.  <p>  <b><p> 
                              Discussion: Bracketing.</b>  If, in an acute oral toxicity study, the lab tested
the concentration of 50 mg/kg (only) and 0/10 test animals died, this would not be sufficient to
categorize the test material. This product could conceivably have an LD50 that would place it into
toxicity category II, III or IV.  The lab should then test at least one additional dose to determine if
the product meets the limit test for Category III or Category IV. <p>                      <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment </i></b></u>:   <b>It is only necessary to test enough doses to
establish
the correct label category (not necessarily an LD50).</b><p>  <p>

<u><b><i>EPA Response </i></b></u>:   <b>The Agency agrees.  We have modified our
discussion
of bracketing to note that it is not necessary to determine an LD50.  However, a test done at a
very low cut-point is not sufficient for labeling.  Limit tests are useful for labeling only if they
allow placement of the product into Category III or Category IV.  Otherwise, overlabeling could
result.</b><p>

<p>

                         a.   If 3-4 test animals die at the limit dose (e.g. 5000 mg/kg for acute oral or
dermal toxicity or 2 mg/L for acute inhalation toxicity study) and no more than one animal dies at
the next limit dose level (e.g. 500 mg/kg for an acute oral toxicity, 2000 mg/kg for acute dermal
toxicity or 0.5 mg/L for an acute inhalation toxicity study).  The toxicity category for the study
would be category <b>III</b>.  <p>  <p>

                         b.   Another example is an acute inhalation toxicity study where two dose levels
are tested, with 7/10 animal deaths at 0.5 mg/L and 0/10 (or 1/10) deaths at 0.03 mg/L. As the
upper limit for acute inhalation toxicity category I is 0.05 mg/L, this would not eliminate the
product from falling into toxicity category I.  This study would not be acceptable without a third
dose level conducted between 0.03 and 0.5 mg/L. <p>  <p>

                              An acute oral, dermal or inhalation toxicity study where one or more test
concentrations are tested that do not allow LD50 determination or bracketing will be rejected. 
Examples of this are:<p> 
<p>

                                             c.   An acute oral toxicity study is submitted with test material
concentrations of 50 and 300 mg/kg.  The study had no mortalities.  This study would not allow
the study to be placed  into any toxicity category as it could only be said that the LD50 is above
300 mg/kg.  This could place the toxicity category into category II, III or IV.<p> 
<p>

                                             d.   An acute dermal toxicity study is conducted at 2000 mg/kg and
the mortality rate is 10/10.  No other test material concentration is tested.  This results of this
study only show that the product could not be placed into toxicity categories III or IV.  However,
this product could fall into either toxicity category I or II for acute dermal toxicity. Thus, this
study would not be acceptable.<p>  <p>

                         7.   <u><i>The laboratory fails to follow a test method approved by the Agency
and the resulting data is questionable </i></u>.  Laboratories should assure their protocols do not
conflict with guidelines, guidance or test methods approved by the Agency. They should also
ensure their protocols are followed. <b> OECD protocols for acute toxicity studies are accepted
by the Agency.</b><p>

<p>

                         8.   <u><i>An unacceptable test species was used </i></u>.  For the acute oral
and inhalation toxicity studies, the preferred species is the rat.  For the acute dermal toxicity
study, the preferred species is the albino rabbit, followed by the rat and the guinea pig.  The
preferred species/strain for the primary eye and skin irritation studies is the albino rabbit.  The
preferred species for the Buehler Method and many of the other dermal sensitization studies is the
guinea pig.  Although the species mentioned above are not the only acceptable species for these
particular studies,  they are the preferred species.  Any lab conducting these studies using other
than the preferred species for that study <u>must</u> provide justification for the use of another
species.  The Agency may reject studies based on the test species used alone.  If a lab has the
intention of using a species other than the preferred species for a particular study, they should
contact the Agency for approval or guidance beforehand.<p>                      <p> 
<u><b><i>Industry Comment </i></u>:  Amend the second sentence to read  ...the preferred
species are
the rabbit, rat and the guinea pig.<p>

</b><p>

<u><b><i>EPA Response </i></u>:  The Agency believes that the preferred species for dermal
toxicity
studies is the albino rabbit.  The rat and the guinea pig are also allowed.  However, the order of
preference is as is given in the second sentence.</b><p>

<p>

     9.        <u><i>The animals were quarantined for an unacceptable length of time </i></u>. The
minimum quarantine time is five days.  Lack of sufficient quarantine period may cause undue
stress in the test animals.  Such strain may contribute to the mortality rate and thus adversely
influence the toxicity.<p> 
<p>

     10.  <u><i>The lab failed to conduct sufficient observations of the test animals </i></u>.   The
lab should consult Subdivision F guidelines for guidance on the observation of test animals.<p> 
<p>

     11.  <u><i>The test animals used were not of an acceptable weight and/or age.</i></u>  Rats
to be used in acute toxicity studies should be 6-10 weeks of age at receipt and 8-12 weeks at
study initiation.  Rabbits should be at least 12 weeks of age at study initiation.  Body weights for
the test animals should be in the range of those for normal animals at that age. The weight range
should not exceed [plus or minus]  20% of the mean preexposure weight for that sex.  The lab
should
report the weights and ages of the test animals for each of the six acute toxicity/irritation studies
and be able to provide a growth curve from the supplier to show that the test animals used were
of normal weight for their age. This applies to all acute toxicity/primary irritation studies. <p>       
                        <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment </i></u>:  The requirement for the growth curve should pertain
only to<u>
rats</u> used in the acute toxicity studies.  The age requirement for <u>rabbits</u> should
pertain only to acute dermal toxicity studies, not to skin and eye irritation studies where the age
and weight of the animal is not important.</b><p> 
                              <p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response </i></u>:</b>   <b>There is no age or size requirement for primary
irritation studies.  However, proper growth is an indication of a healthy animal.  Therefore, the lab
should be able to demonstrate that the test animals used were of normal weight for their age in
order to ensure that they are healthy animals.<p> 
</b><p>

     12.<u>    <i>A lack of equipment calibration.</i></u>  Although records on equipment
calibration are not required in the report, these data must be maintained by the laboratory.<p> 
<p>

     13.  <u><i>Incorrect replacement of animals other than at study initiation when a dosing

B. Errors in Reporting [General Study Deficiencies]</b><p>  <p>

                         1.   <u><i>Failure to properly identify the test material </i></u>.  Often, studies
identify test materials by a pesticide manufacturer's internal code, an obsolete name or some form
of identification other than the current product name or EPA registration number.  Ideally, the test
material name should be identical to the product name.  <p>

The test material
should be properly identified in the report.  If this is not possible, the registrant should include a
statement identifying the test material in the submission to the Agency.  When the test material
used in a study is not the product for which registration is sought, the registrant must include the
name of the test material (a product name if possible), the CSF of the test material and the test
material's EPA registration number (if possible), the test material's relationship to the product (if
any) and clearly explain why this particular test material was submitted to support the product. 
<p> 
<p>

                              At times, the lab may include a copy of the product formulation in the study
report.  When this reported formula is not the same as the product CSF, this study may not be
accepted. This will call for a similarity determination based on chemical formulation.   <p> 
<p>

                         2.   <u><i>The test material is not properly described </i></u>.  The description
of the test material should include:<p> 
<p>

a.   The physical form of the test material, e.g., liquid, paste, aerosol
spray, granular, etc.<p> 
b.   pH of the test material.<p>                         
c.   Special properties of the test material that may affect testing, e.g., very viscous
liquid, gel, encapsulated pesticide in suspension, color, etc. <p> 
d.   Manufacturer's lot number of the test substance.<p>                         
      <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment </i></u>:  The pH should only be required when appropriate, for
aqueous
liquids used in skin and eye irritation studies.</b><p>

<p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response</i></u>:  The pH of the test material is appropriate for many
additional
situations.  It is appropriate for moistened solids which will be applied to the skin and is also
appropriate for solids in solution or suspension for oral toxicity studies.<p>  Obviously, pH would
not be appropriate for a solid material instilled in the eye.<p>  </b><p> 
                         3.   <u><i>Noncompliant or missing QA or GLP statements may lead to study
rejection or delayed review </i></u>.  Refer to the 40 CFR part 160 and Subdivision F Guidelines
for guidance.  If the data raises concerns as to its validity and the study lacks appropriate QA and
GLP statements, it will be rejected.  If the data does not otherwise raise concerns about its
acceptability, deficiencies in QA/GLP reporting will not influence the acceptance of the study;
however, such studies will be referred to the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance
(OECA) for follow-up.  <p>

<p>

                         4.   <u><i>Unreported data or other missing information </i></u>.  On occasion,
pages are missing from the study report or the laboratory may fail to include information such as a
legend explaining abbreviations used in reporting study results.  At times reports do not include
the complete details of a study. Perhaps this is because the laboratory assumes that certain aspects
of the study are unimportant or the laboratory has included a protocol that covers the particular
type of study.  Laboratories should submit reports that address all details of that specific study. 
The report should relate how that particular study was conducted.    Laboratory QA units must
insure that the reports are complete and accurate.   <p>

<p>

                         5.   <u><i>The report or parts of the report are illegible.</i></u>  Although this
usually concerns reprints or "blowbacks" of reports, it is not restricted to reports submitted in the
form of a reprint.<p>  <p>

                         6.   <u><i>The report contains incorrect calculations that the reviewer is not able
to clarify.</i></u>  In such instances, the reviewer must consult the registrant/lab for clarification
or the submission may have to be rejected if prompt resolution of the misunderstanding is not
attainable.  <p>

<p>

                         7.   <u><i>Dilutions of a test material are not reported or are not adequately
reported </i></u>.  When a test material is diluted the dilutions must be defined and the reasons
for the dilution must be clearly explained. <p>   
<p>

8.   <u><i>The ages, weights and/or source of the test animals is (are) not reported.</i></u> 
This is
a requirement for all acute toxicity studies as per Subdivision F guidelines 81-1 through 81-6 and

dose concentration?</b>  For purposes of precautionary labeling, constant concentration is more
important than constant volume.<p>                      <p> 
                    <b>       Discussion:  Is analytical confirmation of dosing solutions a necessity? </b>
Analytical confirmation of dosing solutions is not a requirement. <p>  <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment </i></u>:   The following guidance for acute oral dosing was
proposed by
the ACPA group and is recommended to be included as guidance:</b><p>  <p>

<b>Acute oral dosing procedures have typically employed either constant dose volume across all
dose levels (EPA, OECD guidelines) or constant dose concentration.  Systemic toxicity can
usually be determined using a constant dose volume to minimize the effects of gastric volume on
absorption.  However,  EPA has expressed concern that excessive dilution of test materials may
not provide a correct assessment of the true toxicity of the test material for hazard labeling
purposes, particularly for those that are corrosive.<p> 
<p>

The following guidance is proposed:<p>

<p>

1)        Either constant volume or constant concentration administration is acceptable, provided
the guidance below on dilutions is employed.<p>

<p>

2)        When possible, liquid test material should be dosed neat.<p>  <p> 
3)        If dosing with neat material is not possible, due to high viscosity or toxicity that            
would preclude accurate low dose volumes, or if constant volume has been deemed to be the
more appropriate method, the test material may be diluted.  The highest concentration possible
should be administrated, although volumes less than 0.5 ml per animal would not be required. 
Lower dose volumes are acceptable if they can be accurately administered.<p> 
                              [Note that the use of the 0.5 ml/ animal dose volume may necessitate a 50X
dilution of a highly toxic (category I, [less than or equal to] 50 mg/kg) test material
to insure accurate dosing.]<p> 
                    <p>

                    4)        If possible, the maximum dose volume should not exceed 1.0 ml/ 100 grams
bodyweight for all vehicles, although volumes up to 2 ml/ 100g for aqueous vehicles are
acceptable with justification.<p> 
                    <p>

                    5)        Solid materials should be suspended or dissolved in the minimum amount of
vehicle and dosed at the highest concentration possible, following the above guidance.<p> 
</b><p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response</i></u>:  The Agency agrees with the guidance outlined
above.</b><p> 
               <p>

                         3.   <u><i>The lab did not fast the animals before dosing.</i></u>  The presence
of foodstuffs in the digestive tract of the test animals can have the effect of diluting the test
material or carrying portions of it through the alimentary canal without digestion.  This action can
thereby reduce the toxicity or corrosive effects of the test substance.  <p>  <p>

                         4.   <u><i>Lack of necropsy </i></u>:   Although gross necropsies are

                         1.   <u><i>The dilution of liquid test materials or over-moistening of dry test
materials.</i></u> All liquid test materials should be undiluted for the acute dermal toxicity study. 
Dry test materials must be moistened with water before application to ensure good contact and no
loss of the test material.  The lab should state the amount of water used to moisten dry test
materials. The dry test materials should not be moistened beyond the that point which is necessary
to assure proper contact with the skin. <p> 
                    <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment </i></u>:  Can we specify that vehicles other than water or saline
such as
gum arabic, ethanol + water, carboxymethyl cellulose, glycerol, propylene glycol, PEG vegetable
oil and mineral oil can be used if water or saline cannot be used as long as the vehicle is not
irritating and the inability to use water or saline is justified in the report.</b><p>  <p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response </i></u>:  The Agency agrees.<p>

</b><p>

                         2.   <u><i>The size of exposure area is incorrect (too small).</i></u>  The
exposure site should be approximately 10% of the animal's body surface area.  The exposure area
is to be from the scapula (shoulder) to the wing of the ileum (hipbone) and halfway down the
flank on each side of the animal. <p> 
                    <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment </i></u>:  Less than 10% body area may be exposed if the material
is
highly toxic.  The second sentence in the above paragraph should read:   The prepared area for a
rat or rabbit dermal toxicity study will be defined as a shaved or clipped area starting at the
scapula (shoulder to the wing of the ileum (hipbone) and half way down the flank on each side of
the animal.</b><p> 
<p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response </i></u>:  The Agency does not agree with the practice of using less
than the
prepared area as defined above for highly toxic substances.  We prefer some other mechanism of
reducing the amount of test substances such as a controlled dilution.  In such a case, it is easier to
compare the dose to doses used in other studies.  If a lesser exposure area is used, it is hard to
calculate what the actual exposure is.<p> 
 </b><p>

                         3.   <u><i>Improper occlusion, covering and wrapping of the test site.</i></u> 
An improperly wrapped test site may result in loss of test material and thus reduce the effective
dose of the pesticide. Important factors to strive for when wrapping the test animals for the acute
dermal toxicity study are: <p> 
<p>

                                        a.   Powders or other solids should be slightly moistened (not runny) to
a paste before application to the test site. <p> 
                                        b.   It is preferred that the test material is applied to the dorsum.<p>       
                                  c.   The gauze covering is added to act as a reservoir for the test material
and to keep it localized.  It is important that not too much gauze is used.  Too many plies or
layers of gauze can have the effect of absorbing the liquid test material or the water used to
moisten the solid test material thus minimizing the amount of test material that is available to the
skin. <p> 
          d.   The test material is further covered with an occlusive material (such as plastic sheeting
or rubber dam) or semi-occlusive material (such as perforated plastic) to prevent evaporation of
liquids from the test site and to prevent ingestion of the test material. <p>  <p>

<b>Discussion: Guidance for occlusion.</b>   Although semi-occlusive dressing is recommended,
occlusive dressing is acceptable. <p>

<p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment</b></u></i>:    <b>We suggest the following wording be added as
agreed
in our May meeting:   When possible the test substance should be applied directly to the skin,
otherwise it may be applied directly to a porous gauze dressing which is immediately placed in
contact with the animal's skin.<p> 
                    <p>

The test substance must be held in contact with the skin with gauze and non-irritating tape for a
24-hour exposure period. The test site must be covered in a suitable manner to retain the test
material in contact with the skin, avoid wicking of material from the skin surface, and to ensure
that the animal cannot ingest the material.  To minimize wicking, the gauze should be no more
than 8-ply; fewer layers of gauze may be needed for small test volumes. Although a
semi-occlusive dressing is preferred, an occlusive dressing will also be acceptable.<p>  <p>

 <b>         B.   Errors in Reporting [Acute Dermal Toxicity]:</b><p>  <p>

                         1.   <u><i>Systemic toxicity, and dermal irritation are not reported or are not
reported sufficiently.</u></i> This information is required and is often helpful in evaluating other
studies.  Evaluations of systemic toxicity and local irritation should be made frequently on the day
of application, and daily thereafter.  Mortality checks alone are not sufficient evaluations.  If
information from the dermal toxicity study is to be used to support dermal irritation labeling, i.e. if
a waiver of the dermal irritation study may be appropriate, observations of dermal reactions
should be made with sufficient frequency and in sufficient detail to obviate the need for a specific
dermal irritation study.  <p>

<a name="sc4">
          A.   Errors in Study Conduct [Acute Inhalation Toxicity].</b><p>                      <p>

                         1.   Historically, one main reason acute inhalation toxicity studies have been
rejected was that the labs were often unable to achieve a small enough Mass Median Aerodynamic
Diameter (MMAD).  However, in 1994, the Agency changed its acceptance criteria.  Currently,
the Agency accepts acute inhalation toxicity studies with MMADs of 1-4 micrometers.  Please
refer to the 2/1/94 HED Memorandum: <i>Interim Policy for Particle Size and Limit
Concentration Issues in Inhalation Toxicity Studies.</i> <p>  <p> 
                                        a.   For dry products that do not readily form aerosols with MMADs at
or below 4 microns, further attempts to reduce their particle size must be made.  Granular
products should be milled (by air mill, ball mill, hammer mill, etc.) for 24 hours if necessary.  If
the product will still not form the proper aerosol and the product is dissolved in liquid before
application, the lab must attempt to dissolve it in the vehicle to obtain an aerosol.  The test
material concentration must be calculated based on the amount of test material without the
diluent.  The acceptable concentration must allow for the diluent.  Water is the recommended
diluent.  If the diluent is some material other than water, a vehicle control study must be
conducted.  <p> 
                              <b><p>

<u><i>Industry Comment</u></i>:  The granular products should be milled for 24 hours as
necessary
<u><i>or until particle size plateaus</u></i>.  If the product will not form a proper aerosol and
the
product is dissolved or suspended in water or another vehicle under conditions of field use, the
study should be conducted in a suspension or solution of water or the vehicle that is used under
commercial use conditions.<p> 
<p>

<u><i>EPA Response</u></i>:     The Agency agrees with the comment.  Granular products
should
be milled for a reasonable amount of time until particle size plateaus.  This may be less than 24
hours.</b><p> 
                              <p>

                                        b.   Products that do not deliver an acceptable particle size and are not
water soluble are excellent candidates for a waiver of the acute inhalation toxicity study. 
Microencapsulated product with a large percentage of capsules above four microns are also
excellent candidates for waivers.  Waivers may be granted for technical and end-use products
which cannot conceivably be generated in sufficient concentration to pose an inhalation hazard. 
All waiver petitions must be considered on a case-by-case basis.  The following are likely waiver
candidates:<p>

                              <p>

1.   Non-volatile products which cannot be readily aerosolized (e.g. viscous liquids, waxes, and
resins), and which are not heated or diluted to an inhalable state during application. <p> 
2.   Tree injections or thick liquids such as lotions, waxes, etc., which contain non-volatile active
ingredients. <p>

3.   Corrosive or highly irritating agents (the chemical may be designated inhalation Toxicity
Category I by default).  The Agency will categorize a study by actual acute inhalation toxicity
data over the corrosivity of a product and may also use systemic toxicity data where available.<p> 
4.   Slow release collars and ear tags (plasticized).<p>                                                         
5.   Products with fewer than 1% of their particles being below 50 microns under conditions of
use, unless that product is toxicity category I by the oral or dermal routes, or induces severe
systemic toxicity upon ocular dosing.<p>

 6.   Non-friable granules.  The registrant must demonstrate that the granules do not produce fines
when subjected to shipping and handling.<p>

 7.   Microencapsulated products that are not readily fractured, dissolved, time released, leaky or
small enough to be respirable.<p>

<p>

                              If an end-use product cannot be aerosolized, but the addition of a diluent
under conditions of use yields an inhalable aerosol, an inhalation study should be performed using
the most concentrated label dilution.  A vehicle control group should be included if a diluent other
than water is used.<p> 
<p>

                         3.   <u><i>Studies that do not demonstrate that the particle concentration was
consistent over the period of the exposure are not acceptable.</u></i>  Studies that do not
conduct the particle size analysis at least twice during the exposure are not acceptable.  Studies
that conduct particle size analysis once during the four hour exposure have not demonstrated that
the particle size was consistent during the exposure.  Chamber concentration and particle size
measurements should be made at least      twice during the study at time points spaced well apart. 
Chamber concentrations   may be measured using gravemetric analysis or by analytical
measurement.  If these are "reasonably consistent" ([plus or minus] 10% for
liquid aerosol, gas or vapor, [plus or minus] 20% for dry aerosol), then two
measurements should be sufficient. If the
measurements are not consistent, then further measurements (a total of 3 or 4) should be
considered.  Pretest measurements may be helpful.<p> 
                    <p>

                         4.   <u><i>Studies with MMADs that are not within an acceptable range will not
be acceptable.</u></i>  All particle size analysis should show the MMAD to be within the
acceptable range of 1-4 microns.  Otherwise, the test animals will not have been exposed to a
respirable particle distribution throughout the exposure.  <p>  <p> 
                              <b>Discussion: Studies where the MMAD exceeds four microns.</b>  The
Agency will evaluate such studies on a case-by-case basis.  If the MMAD is only slightly above
four microns and there are no other reasons to question the acceptability of the study,  the Agency
will accept the study.  <p> 
                    <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment</b></u></i>:  <b>Studies should not be rejected, if reasonable
efforts to minimize particle size are employed.<p>

</b><p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response</u></i>:  The Agency agrees.<p>

<p>

</b>                               5.   <u><i>The lab did not obtain a concentration sufficient to determine
an LC50  or conduct a proper limit test.</u></i>  At times, OPP has received acute inhalation
toxicity studies that tested one or two aerosol concentrations, the concentration tested was below
the limit test concentration and no explanation was given.   If the lab can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Agency that the test was actually conducted at the maximum attainable
concentration, and there is no evidence of toxicity at that concentration, the product will be
assigned toxicity category IV.  The report must include a description of the physical and chemical
nature of the test material, and a justification for the acceptance of the study.   Otherwise, this
study will not be acceptable.<p>

<p>

     Often times, labs had problems attaining limit test concentrations. An acute inhalation toxicity
limit test was originally a four hour exposure to a test atmosphere at a concentration of 5.0 mg/L. 
However, in 1994 the Agency changed the limit test concentration to 2.0 mg/L.  Acceptable acute
inhalation toxicity studies which show no mortality at concentrations above 2.0 mg/L will be
placed into toxicity category IV.  <p> 
<p>

     Corrosive test materials that cannot achieve appropriate particle distributions and/or particle
concentrations may be placed into toxicity category I if there is no other evidence indicating low
toxicity.  Other evidence would likely be the results of an acute oral toxicity study. <p> 
<p>

                         6.   <u><i>The limit test concentration was too low.</u></i>  OPP may also
reject studies that test more than one concentration below the limit test concentration and fail to
determine the LC50 (or LD50). If a lab tests product concentrations below the limit test without
determining an LC50, they should include an explanation of this as part of their submission.  This
has overwhelmingly been a problem of acute inhalation toxicity studies. <p>  <p>

                         7.   <u><i>Studies that do not measure the test material concentrations from the
breathing zone of the animals will not be accepted.</u></i>  Studies not measuring the test
material concentration from the breathing zone will not be taking representative samples. <p> 
<p>

                         8.   <u><i>Studies that do not provide a <b>continuous</b> four hour test
material exposure.</u></i>  The exception to this rule is studies with a 100% mortality before the
end of the exposure.  If a 100% mortality level is found and the study does not allow the
placement of the product into <b>toxicity category I</b>, other concentrations must be tested.  A
mean or time weighted average should be used if more than two measurements were taken and
significant variability exists between the measurements.<p>  <p>

                         9.   <u><i>Studies that report analytic or gravimetric concentrations that are
higher than the nominal concentration.</u></i>  In these situations, the lab appears to be
measuring more test material than was introduced into the test chamber.<p>  <p> 
  10.     <u><i>Studies displaying mortality with the oxygen concentrations below 19% or fewer
than
ten chamber air changes per hour.</u></i> A study may have an insufficient oxygen level due to
the
concentration of the oxygen in the supplied air or due to an insufficient number of air changes.  If
such a study reported mortality, it could not be said that the mortality was solely attributable to
exposure to the test material.  Studies whose only deficiency is the lack of reporting the oxygen
concentration or number of chamber air changes per hour may be accepted.<p>  <p>

  11.     <u><i>Failure to remove excess test material from animal's coats after exposure.</u></i> 
An
effort should be made to remove excess test material.  Removal of excess material eliminates
concerns of exposure to the test material from ingestion or dermal absorption.  Delayed deaths
cannot be solely attributed to inhalation of test material if this precaution is not taken. <p>  <p>

  12.     <u><i>Animals (by volume) occupy more than <b>5% </b>of the exposure
chamber.</u></i> 
This requirement is stated in the Subdivision F guidelines.  Animal volume is calculated assuming
that each gram of animal occupies one cc of volume within the chamber.  <p>  <p>

                                13.     <u><i>Lack of necropsy.</u></i>  Although it is not a requirement,
gross necropsies are recommended. <p>

<p>

a.   The length (of time) of the exposure of the test animals to the aerosol. <p> 
b.   The method of exposure of the test animals, e.g., whole body or nose only exposure.<p>         
c.   The chamber rate of airflow, temperature, humidity, and how each was measured.<p> 
d.   The actual concentrations of test material in the chamber atmosphere measured from the
breathing zone of the test animals.  This must be in tabular form.<p>

e.   The chamber concentration must be reported in mg/L, not ppm or mg/m<sup>3</sup>. <p>    
                   
f.   Reports should state whether concentrations were measured from the breathing zone.<p> 
g.   The rate of air flow, volume of air taken and length of time the air was measured for aerosol

<b>          A.   Errors in the Conduct of the Study [Primary Eye Irritation]</b><p>  <p>

                         1.   <u><i>Failure to test aerosol products by spraying test material into the
eyes.</u></i>  Aerosols should be sprayed into an eye held open for one second from a distance
of 10 cm.  It is necessary for aerosol products to be sprayed so that the physical damage that may
occur because of the force of the spray may be evaluated.  The exception to this rule is total
release foggers.  In testing most total release fogger sprays, instillation of the liquid from the
fogger spray will have to be carried out.  CRP will be required for such products and labeling
identifying the physical hazard will be required.  <p> 
<p>

                              The Agency will allow industry to develop a system to determine the ocular
damage that would be caused by the physical force of various aerosol sprays. <p> 
<p>

                         2.   <u><i>The use of fluorescein stain stopped before resolution of
opacity.</u></i>  Fluorescein aids in sighting lesions that otherwise may not be apparent.<p> 
                    <p>

<u><i>Industry Comment</u></i>:  <b>Fluorescein does not measure opacity and therefore it
may be
stopped before the resolution of opacity.  Opacity is recorded as a separate observation.  Lack of
fluorescein staining is not a reason for study rejection; however the use of this method is
encouraged.</b><p> 
<p>

<u><i>EPA Response</u></i>:     <b>The Agency agrees that the use of fluorescein is
encouraged,
but not required.  Although fluorescein may not measure opacity, if it is used and anomalies are
observed, the use should be continued until the anomalies are resolved.  Otherwise, the results are
ambiguous and difficult to interpret. </b><p> 
<p>

                         3.   <u><i>The study ended before resolution of all irritation.</u></i>  For eyes
showing irritation at 72 hours, scoring should be continued and as frequently as needed until all
irritation has subsided or for 21 days, whichever comes first.  The exception to this rule is
irritation so severe that the test material will obviously be placed into toxicity category I whether
the study is continued or not. <p> 
                    <p>

                         4.   <u><i>Incorrect volume of test material used.</u></i> The correct volume is
0.1 ml for liquids, and for solid test substances, the weight equivalent of 0.1 ml or a weight of not
more than 100 mg should be used.  Aerosols should be sprayed into an eye held open for one
second from a distance of 10 cm.  <b>The Agency prefers the use of the weight equivalent of 0.1
ml be used for solid substances, even if the weight if more than 100 mg.  For most test substances,
0.1 mg and 0.1 ml will be fairly close.  But if a material is very heavy and 100 mg is a very small
volume, this may not represent the "worst-case" eye irritation potential.</b><p>  <u><i>               
 </u></i>                <p>

                         5.   <u><i>The test material was a solid consisting of large granules or other
large solid particles, and was not ground before instillation.</u></i>  Where possible, test
materials should be ground to a fine powder before instillation into the eye.   If the solid test
material can not be readily ground, but can still be placed into the conjunctival sac,  then it should
be tested as is.<p>

<b><u><i><p>Industry Comment</u></i>:  If the granules are large and not amenable to
grinding then a waiver may be obtained.  </b><p> 
<p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response</u></i>:  The Agency agrees.<p>
</b><p>
6.   <u><i>The data submitted was only on animals whose eyes had been rinsed immediately after
test material instillation.</u></i>  The report must include data on test animals whose eyes were
not washed out before 24 hours after instillation. <p>  <p> 
                         7.   <u><i>The test material was diluted before instillation into test animals'
eyes.</u></i>  <p> 
<p>

                         8.   <u><i>Studies using animals that display irritation, "background opacity" or
"naturally occurring opacity" before test material administration.</u></i>  Such animals should
not be selected for testing. <p> 
<p>

                         9.   <u><i>The method of observation was incorrect.</u></i>  Evaluations
should be made using white light, resembling day light.  Pen lights are not acceptable for reading
ocular irritation.  The use of magnification and fluorescein is encouraged.  The slit lamp is
considered the most accurate way of detecting lesions in the eyes.  Absence of fluorescein staining
may not always signify healing of all corneal lesions, because the eye heals from the corneal
epithelium inward.  <p>

                    <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment</u></i>:  The above comment is not acceptable, and not as we

                    <p>

                              The use of bright room light or a pen light with or without the use of 
magnification is acceptable.  <p> 
                    <p>

                              If observation of the reactions is aided by the use of a binocular loupe, hand
slit lamp, biomicroscope or other suitable device, these findings should be thoroughly described,
recorded and reported.</b><p> 
                         <p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response</u></i>:  The Agency does not agree that bright room light or a pen

three in accordance with OECD protocol. <p>  <p>

                                   11.  <b>Discussion: Are scores of "1" considered to be positive?</b> 
Scores of 1 for conjunctival redness, discharge and/or swelling are not considered to be positive
and do not influence precautionary labeling.<p>                                <p>

<h2>VI.  <u><i>Primary Skin Irritation</u></i> </h2><p>

<p>
<a name="sc6">
<b>     A.   Errors in Study Conduct [Primary Skin Irritation].</b><p>  <p>

                         1.   <u><i>The size of the exposure area is incorrect.</u></i> The appropriate
size is 1 in2 (6 cm2). <p> 
<p>

                         2.   <u><i>An improper amount of test material was used.</u></i>  The proper
quantity is 0.5 milliliters for liquids and 0.5 grams for solids.  <p>  <p>

                         3.   <u><i>The dry (solid, powder) test material was not moistened for
application.</u></i>  The moistening of the test material helps it to penetrate the dermal
membrane.  The test material must be moistened <u><i>before</u></i> application to assure
uniformity.  The dry test material should be slightly moistened (not runny) to a paste using water. 
The amount of water used to moisten the test material should be stated in the report.<p>  <p> 
                         4.   <u><i>The test material was diluted rather than moistened without giving an
explanation.</u></i>  Dilution (over-moistening) of the test material may reduce the irritation
obtained.<p>

<p>

                         5.   <u><i>The exposure site was not properly occluded.</u></i>  The exposure
site should be semi-occluded.  In cases where the test material contains a significant amount of an
alcohol or petroleum distillate, care should be taken to preclude a reaction between the adhesive
and the test material.  Interaction between some test materials (containing an alcohol or petroleum
distillate) and the adhesive could easily change the outcome of the study.  It is important that the
lab not cover the test material with enough gauze to pull liquid test material or a moistening agent
away from the skin site.  Other considerations in dermal application are discussed under acute
dermal toxicity.<p> 
                    <p>

<u><i><b>Industry Comment</u></i>:  Please see the specific wording for semi-occlusion under
the
industry comments for dermal toxicity.  At the industry meeting in May it was also agreed that use
of an occlusive dressing would not be a criteria for study rejection.</b><p>  <p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response</u></i>:  The Agency agrees.<p>

</b><p>

                         6.   <u><i>The exposure period was not four hours.</u></i>  The study may be
accepted if the exposure period was greater than four hours and minor irritation (toxicity category
III or IV) was noted.<p> 
<p>

                         7.   <u><i>The exposure site was not rinsed with water or another suitable
vehicle after the four hour exposure and severe irritation was observed.</u></i>  Without wiping
the exposure site, the residual test material may continue to cause irritation and fallaciously
increase the toxicity category of the product.  <p>  <p>

     8.   <u><i>Preparation of the exposure site is incorrect.</u></i>  One example could be that
the exposure site was not depilated. <p> 
                                        <p>

     9.   <u><i>Abrasion of test sites.</u></i>  This is thought to exacerbate the irritation.  The
study will be rejected if the abrasion may have placed the study in a higher toxicity category (I or
II).<p> 
<p>

   10.    <u><i>Observations were not conducted until irritation had subsided</u></i>. 
Observations
should be continued until irritation has subsided (no scores other than "1" for dermal erythema
and/or edema) or 14 days has been reached. If there is still irritation at 14 days the study may be
ended.  The exception to this rule would be ending a study early when it is evident that it will be
placed into toxicity category I. <p> 
<p>

   11.    <u><i>Test animals were not young adult.</u></i>   Healthy adults should be used.  The
test
animals should be of normal weight for their age.<p>

<p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment</u></i>:  The requirement should read "Healthly adult animals"
(not
necessarily young) should be used.  As long as animals are healthy, their weight is not important,
it was agreed in the industry/regulator's meeting in May.  There will be no weight restrictions
since there is no scientific evidence that age or weight impacts the results of eye or skin irritation
studies.  Reference EPA guidelines.</b><p> 
<p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response</u></i>:  As previously noted, there are not weight restrictions. 
However,
the health of animals that are not of normal weight for their age will be questioned.<p>  </b><p> 
   12.    <u><i>Unjustified use of a moistening agent other than water (or saline).</u></i>  Water
is the
preferred agent to be used for moistening dry test materials for primary skin irritation studies
because it resembles sweating by humans.  Other vehicles may cause irritation by themselves or
exacerbate irritation caused by the test material. Other moistening agents are not acceptable. The
study may be upgraded upon subsequent explanation of the choice in vehicle. <p>  <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment</u></i>:  Although water or saline is the preferred moistening
agent,
other agents may be used providing the use is justified.  Acceptable alternatives include: gum
arabic, ethanol + water, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, vegetable oil and
mineral oil.  These can be used if water or saline cannot be used as long as the vehicle is not
irritating and the inability to use water or saline is justified in the report.</b><p>  <p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response</u></i>:  The Agency agrees.<p>

</b><p>

   13.    <u><i>Too few animals were used.</u></i>  The Agency prefers that six animals be used
in the
primary skin irritation study; however, in accordance with OECD criteria, the Agency will accept
primary skin irritation studies conducted with only three animals. <p>  <p>

   14.    <b>Discussion: Waivers.</b>  The primary skin irritation study may be waived for
products with pHs of 2 or less, or, 11.5 or above.  These products will be placed into toxicity
category I by default.  If the registrant wishes to have such a product placed into a toxicity
category other than I, he must have a primary skin irritation study conducted to prove that a
toxicity category I is inappropriate for this product.<p>    <p> 
                              The primary skin irritation study may also be waived if the material was no
more than slightly irritating after the 24-hour acute dermal toxicity test exposure.  The sites will
have to have been scored using the Draize Scale.  Such products will be placed into toxicity
category IV. <p> 
<p>
<a name="e6">
<b>          B.   Reporting Errors [Primary Skin Irritation].</b><p>  <p>

                         1.   <u><i>The irritation scoring scale used by the lab is not reported.</u></i> 
Dermal irritation is usually reported numerically.  When the scale used for grading is not identified
or included in the report, the Agency cannot be sure of the irritation observed.<p>

<p>

                         2.   <u><i>The method of preparation of the exposure site is not
reported.</u></i>  The report should state how the hair was removed from the exposure site, etc.
<p>

<p>

                         3.   <u><i>The location of the exposure site is not reported.</u></i>  The report
should state where on the animal's body the testing site was located. <p>

                    <p>

                         4.   <u><i>Insufficient detail or imprecise reporting of observations.</u></i>  For
example, stating that the exposure site is <i>exfoliated</i>, and giving no further information is
vague.  Exfoliation can be desquamation or sloughing.  Quite often, reports fail to go into detail
or fail to attempt to give a visual representation of the irritation observed when such irritation
goes beyond erythema or edema. <p>

                    <p>

<b><u><i>Industry Comment</u></i>:  For consistency the Agency should provide a definition
of the
descriptive terms for exfoliation, desquamation and sloughing.</b><p>  <p>

<b><u><i>EPA Response</u></i>:  The laboratory should define the terms used in the reporting
of
observations.<p> 
</b><p>

                         5.   <u><i>Failure to report the condition of the skin after sloughing.</u></i> 
Sloughing very often leaves the skin thickened and denuded (hyperplasia or hyperkeratosis and
dead skin follicles).  <p> 
                    <p>

                              Observations should clearly indicate whether the skin has returned to "normal" 
or whether the skin has been irreversibly changed, i.e., scarred, blanched or denuded. Reversibility
of skin reactions is as important as the primary skin irritation index. <p> 
<p>
<a name="sens">
<h2>VII. <u><i>Dermal Sensitization</u></i> <p></h2>

<p>

     <b>Discussion: When is the study required?</b>  The dermal sensitization study is required
when there will be opportunity for repeated exposure to the product.  EPA will waive the dermal
sensitization study for formulations which are classified as toxicity category I for dermal toxicity
or dermal irritation.  Products that are placed into toxicity category I for dermal toxicity or dermal
irritation with use dilutions that do not require the use of protective clothing will also require a
dermal sensitization study.  The sensitization study is always required for the technical materials,
regardless of the toxicity or irritation properties of that technical.  In Canada, the sensitization
study is always required unless the use dilution is also irritating.  The California Department of
Pesticide Regulation does not routinely require skin sensitization studies to register pesticides. 
Products may also be categorized as sensitizers if components of the formulation are known
sensitizers.<p>

<p>

     The dermal sensitization study is the only one of the six acute toxicity/irritation studies that
may be conducted using one of several techniques.  Subdivision F Guidelines offer a choice of
methodologies.  The seven testing methods accepted by the Office of Pesticide Programs for
dermal sensitization studies are:<p> 
<p>

          1.   The Buehler Method/the Modified Buehler Method.  This is by far the method
submitted most often to OPP for dermal sensitization.  Recommended references for this study

the Buehler Method.  The Agency chose to focus on the Buehler Method because it is by far the
dermal sensitization study submitted most often to the Agency.  The following Buehler Method
study deficiencies are separated into errors in the conduct of the study and reporting errors. <p> 
<p>

<b>          A.   Errors in Study Conduct [Dermal Sensitization].</b> <p>            <p>

          1.   <u><i>Failure to select the proper induction and/or challenge concentrations from the
primary irritation screening.</u></i>  An improper induction concentration (too low) may fail to
evoke sensitization with a substance that may have otherwise brought about sensitization. <p>

<p>

     Too high a challenge concentration is a problem that is frequently seen in dermal sensitization
studies.  Labs sometimes choose a challenge concentration that elicits irritation in unsensitized
animals.  When the lab chooses an irritating concentration of test material for challenge, it may
not be possible to determine whether the irritation noted was a result of a sensitization reaction or
simply dermal irritation. <p> 
          <p>

          2.   <u><i>Failure to report the results of the primary irritation screening.</u></i> 
Without the results of the primary irritation screening, it is not possible (or at least difficult) to
assess the choice of induction and challenge concentrations.<p>  <p> 
           3. <u><i>The lab used the wrong vehicle for the test material.</u></i>  Although water or
saline is a the preferred moistening agent, other agents may be used providing the use is justified. 
Acceptable alternatives include: gum arabic, ethanol + water, carboxymethyl cellulose,
polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and ethanol for induction with acetone for challenge.  These can be
used if water or saline cannot be used as long as the vehicle is not sensitizing and the inability to
use water or saline is justified in the report.  Mineral oils and petrolatum should be avoided when
possible because they may induce irritation independent of any test materials.  <p>            <p> 
          4.   <u><i>Use of ethanol as a vehicle for both induction and challenge.</u></i>  Buehler
has stated that ethanol alone can induce sensitization.  When sensitization reactions occur with the
use of ethanol as the vehicle for both induction and challenge, it is not possible to decide whether
the reactions were a result of the test material or the vehicle.  Please refer to "A Review of the
Buehler Guinea Pig Skin Sensitization Test and Its Use in a Risk Assessment Process for Human
Skin Sensitization", <u><i>Toxicology</u></i>, Robinson et al., vol. 61, 1990, p. 91-107. <p> 
<p>

          5.   <u><i>The study contained a vehicle control instead of a naive control.</u></i> 
Vehicle controls are necessary when one is using a vehicle other than water, saline,
carboxymethylcellulose, ethanol or acetone; however, they may not be used to replace naive
controls.  Vehicle controls are recommended when corn oil or glycerol are used as a vehicle.<p> 
<p>

          6.   <u><i>Induction and challenge performed on the same exposure site.</u></i>  Skin
fatigue may cause irritation in this situation that would falsely appear to be sensitization.<p>  <p>

          7.   <u><i>Use of the same concentration (other than 100% for nonirritating test materials)
for both induction and challenge.</u></i>  The lab must conduct the induction at an at least
minimally irritating concentration. Challenge should be conducted at the highest nonirritating
concentration.  The only time the same concentration may be used for both induction and
challenge is if testing a nonirritant and a 100% concentration is selected for both induction and
challenge, or if the lab is testing a moistened solid.<p>

          <p>

               A preliminary irritation screening study should be conducted to determine a mildly to
moderately irritating concentration for induction as well the maximum non-irritating concentration
to be used at challenge.  Non-irritants should be tested undiluted.  Solid non-irritants should be
tested at the most concentrated dilution possible.  Although it is possible to induce sensitization at
a non-irritating concentration, a dermal reaction causing mild to moderate irritation (scores of 1 to
2) in the induction phase is preferred.  Moderate or severe irritation in the induction phase will not
cause a study to be rejected.  Concentrations of 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% are acceptable for the
irritation screen.  Significant irritation at the lowest concentration would necessitate a second
range-finding study.<p> 
     <p>

     The challenge concentration should be lower than the induction concentration, unless the
undiluted test material is non-irritating.  Ideally, this concentration should cause no more than
50% +/- scores (if the Buehler method is used).<p> 
 <p>

          8.   <u><i>The chosen protocol was not followed.</u></i>  The test deviated from the
procedures as recommended.  Refer to VII (1) above.<p> 
<p>

9.        <u><i>Rechallenge was not conducted when appropriate.</u></i>  Rechallenge is needed
when the challenge results are equivocal. For example, 5/10 +/- or .5 scores in the test group
without reactions in the naive control group, or 9/10 +/- or .5 scores and 1/10 grade 1 scores in
the test group with 5/10 +/- or .5 scores in the naive control group.<p>            <b><p>

</b>                                    10.  <u><i>A different exposure time was used for induction and
challenge and a naive control group was not included.</u></i>  The preferred exposure time is six
hours.  Preliminary screening exposure must also be six hours.  Some labs tend to use exposure
concentrations of 24 hours.  While this is generally acceptable, it may lead to problems if there
was a 24 hours prescreen with too little irritation during a six-hour exposure induction. <p>  <p>

                    11.  <u><i>Using different scales to grade different parts of a study.</u></i>  It is
recommended that labs use the Buehler Scale (for the Buehler Method).  It is also acceptable to
use the 0, 1, 2, 3 scale from the Magnusson &amp; Kligman testing method.  As there is more
than one version scale, reference to which scale was used should be provided.  This is acceptable
as the EPA has agreed to accept OECD protocols.  The rating scale should be described in the
report.<p> 
                    <p>

                    12.  <u><i>The solid test material was not moistened or was not properly
moistened.</u></i>  Solids must be slightly moistened (not runny) to a paste, preferably with
water or saline.  Other vehicles, including corn oil, may be used if justified and if they do not
cause irritation.  Suspensions and emulsions may be diluted with water provided that an
acceptable irritation dose-response relationship can be demonstrated and provided that the
induction and challenge concentrations fulfill the appropriate criteria.  If not, then the test material
should be dissolved, preferably in acetone or alcohol, although other non-irritating vehicles may
be used if justified.<p> 
<p>

                    13.  <u><i>The volume of test material was too small.</u></i>  The recommended
dosage is 0.4 ml or 0.5 ml for liquids and 0.4 g or 0.5 g for solids.  A volume of 0.3 ml may be
appropriate if a Hilltop Chamber is used.<p> 
                    <b><u><i><p>

Industry Comment</u></i>:  The references listed above should be followed.  Exact volume may
vary, since the references specify that the patch should be saturated so that there is a maximum
concentration at the interface of the patch and the skin.</b><p>  <p>

                    14.  <u><i>Lack of a naive control group</u></i><p>  <p> 
                       - No naive control animals were tested. (This is acceptable if the test material was
non-irritating and the study induced and challenged at a 100% test material concentration.)<p> 
                       - A second set of naive controls is needed if a rechallenge is conducted.<p>  <p>

                    15.  <u><i>Deficiencies in the positive control study</u></i> <p>  <p> 
   -      Lack of a positive control study.  <p>

                       - Positive control study was not conducted within six months of the main dermal
sensitization study.<p> 
   -      The positive control study did not prove sensitization.<p> 
                       - Submission of only summary data for the positive control study.<p> 
                       - Use of the same concentration for both induction and challenge.<p>  <p>

     The positive control study is used to prove a laboratory's ability to properly conduct a dermal
sensitization study.  The positive control study should be conducted in the same manner as the
main sensitization study.  The Buehler Method should be followed if that was the method of the
main sensitization study. <p>

<h3>Questions and Answers Column</h3>

<h3>By Jane Snell</h3>
</center>
<p>
<hr size=4><p>
All questions will appear in this column under the auspices of the S.Q.A. and no personal or
company affiliation will appear in print. Dr. Paul Lepore and Dr. Dexter Goldman will respond
for the FDA and EPA, respectively.<p>

<p>

 The following questions were submitted for response from both the EPA and the FDA.<p>

<p>

<b>Questions<p></b>

<p>

 There appears to be a discrepancy in what the EPA and the FDA acknowledge as raw data for
histopathology. The FDA has previously taken the position that the raw data refers only to the
signed and dated final report of the pathologist and that interim reports and notes of the
pathologist do not need to be retained. Histopathology data at our laboratory are entered into a
computer by a data clerk as the pathologist reads slides and dictates observations. A papertape
printout is simultaneously generated as the information is entered for the pathologist's review.
We have taken the stand that the final printout version of the computer summary, signed by the
pathologist, are the raw data. This has met FDA requirements (the intermediate paper tape
printouts were to be discarded). However, during a recent EPA inspection, we were informed
that all papertape printouts and computer summary printouts were to be retained in order to
create an auditable trail of histopathology data. To prevent the need to handle histopathology
data differently for FDA and EPA studies, please: 1 ) define histopathology raw data, and 2)
clarify the Agency's position on what histopathology records must be retained.<p>

<p>

<b>Response--FDA--Dr. Paul Lepore:<p></b>

<p>

 Section 58.3(k) of FDA's GLPs define raw data as laboratory worksheets, records, memoranda,
notes or exact copies thereof, that are the result of original observations and activities and are
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the final report. Although the notes taken by a
pathologist during histopathological examination of slides are indeed the result of original
observations, the notes are not necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the final report.
The final report is evaluated by an analysis of the pathology syndrome that is described in the
pathologist's report required under section 58.185(a)(12). Further, because section 58.190(a)
requires histopathological slides to be retained as specimens, the final report can be
reconstructed by verification of the pathology findings by a second pathologist or by a team of
pathologists. The interim notes, therefore, which are subject to frequent changes as the
pathologist refines the diagnosis, are not raw data because they do not contribute to study
reconstruction. Accordingly, only the signed and dated final report of the pathologist comprises
raw data respecting the histopathological evaluation of tissue specimens.<p>

<p>

 In regard to the second question, it is difficult for me to clarify fully which histopathology
records must be retained since there are interlaboratory differences in histopathology
documentation. Generally, though, the only records that can be discarded are the interim notes of
the pathologist.<p>

<p>

<b>Response--EPA--Dr. Dexter Goldman:<p></b>

<p>

The definition of raw data has been previously published in EPA's Good Laboratory Practice
regulations for both FIFRA and TSCA. In addition, this was recently restated by Dr. Paul Lepore
of the FDA in the S.Q.A. Newsletter, when he wrote, ". . . I consider raw data to be the first
record of an original observation that is made in a nonclinical laboratory study . . ."<p>

<p>

 The FDA has deviated from this basic definition of raw data to the extent that for
histopathology, ". . . Raw data . . . refers only to the signed and dated (final) report of the
pathologist. Agency investigators may wish to examine the interim notes and reports in an
attempt to reconstruct the study but not to second-guess the scientific process used to arrive at
the final report . . ." [FDA Post-Conference Report, August (1979, p. 31)].<p>

<p>

 The EPA does not apply this exception, but for pathology, as well as for all other specialties
responsible for the proper conduct and interpretation of a study, retains the basic definition that
raw data are the first record of an original observation. There does not appear to be any
compelling reason to make an arbitrary redefinition for one specialty when it is not made for
others.<p>

<p>

 The specific answer to the first question is that the paper-tape printout, which is generated
simultaneously with the pathologist's review, are the raw data for that observation. This trail tape
should, accordingly, be verified and then dated and signed by the pathologist. Any subsequent
computer-generated reports should be verified by Q.A. against this trail tape.<p>

<p>

 The general answer to the first question is that the first and original interpretation of the
slide-mounted tissue are raw data. The raw data may be in the form of a written record that is
signed and dated when the observation is made, or it may be on magnetic medium (disc or tape).
Since the magnetic medium cannot be read, it must be converted by the computer to a printed
page. This printed page, once verified, signed, and dated, constitutes the raw data. Any change to
any medium after this point must be made in compliance with the GLP regulations, i.e., the
original must be retained, the correction must be made by a person authorized to make the
change, and the change must be signed, dated, and a reason given. There are a number of ways
of doing this on paper, and the means of adapting the computer program to accomplish this are
not excessively complex.<p>

<p>

 The Agency has no intention of monitoring the thought process of the pathologist or interfering
with the changes that are routinely made to interpretations in histopathology. The authorized
pathologist may make as many changes as he/she wishes to make until the final pathology report
is ready. The Agency only insists that the entire change file be a permanent record.<p>

<p>

 The basic reason for this raw data requirement is that it is not possible for the Agency to audit,
completely, all studies submitted to it, let alone those that involve histopathology. The pathology
portion of the study, in order to be properly audited, must have the same audit trail as any other
portion of the study. It is important that the Agency be able to deduce when changes have been
made and, if necessary, why.<p>

<p>

 The answer to the second question is apparent. All histopathology records that have been
required for archiving must still be archived plus the entire histopathology audit trail as
described above. <p>

<h3>Questions and Answers Column</h3>
<h3>By Jane Snell</h3>
</center>
<p>

Dr. Lepore, please respond to the following scenario:<p>

<p>

 On Monday morning, John Q. Technician is in the process of weighing animals, starting a water
monitor and recording clinical observations "on line" in the animal room. After completing 20
cages, the system crashes during cage 21 operations. The system is down for 2 days during
which time all data is collected manually. Miraculously, the system is operational by Wednesday
and all manual data is entered into the system and the entry is 100% second person signature
verified.<p>

<p>

<b>Questions:<p></b>

<p>

 a) What does the raw data consist of for this 2-day period?<p>

<p>

 b) Is it necessary to perform a validation procedure once the system again becomes
operational?<p>

<p>

<b>Response:<p></b>

<p>

 a) As a rule of thumb, I consider raw data to be the first record of an original observation that is
made in a nonclinical laboratory study. In the cited example, data entry by the technician "on
line" causes the information in the computer storage medium to be considered to be raw data. By
contrast, the paper records collected during the two-day period of computer downtime are to be
considered as raw data The data verification step performed by the second person when the
paper records are entered into the computer is a good quality control practice, but it does not
change the raw data status of the paper records.<p>

<p>

 b) I don't think it is necessary to validate the system every time a crash occurs. I believe the
need for validation should arise from a consideration of the reasons for the crash. Your computer
professionals should assess this need.<p>

<p>

 c) No one asked but, yes, this is the tenth anniversary of FDA's GLPs. They were published as
proposals in November of 1976. <p>

<p>

All questions will appear in this column under the auspices of the S.Q.A. and no personal or
company affiliation will appear in print.  Dr. Paul Lepore and Dr. Dexter Goldman will respond
for the FDA and EPA respectively.<p>
<p>
Send your questions and comments to:<p>
<p>
Jane M. Snell<br>
EG&G Mason Research Institute<br>
57 Union Street<br>
Worchester MA 01608<p>
<p>
<b>Question 1:</b> What is the EPA's policy regarding the acceptability of Q.A. personnel
being designated as responsible for the archives?<p>
<p>
<b>Response 1 (Dr. Goldman):</b> The relevant sections of EPA's GLP regulations, both
TSCA and
FIFRA, address archiving of raw data, documentation, specimens, etc., in some detail with
regard to what shall be retained, how it shall be retained, and that only authorized personnel shall
enter the archives.  The regulations do not deny that function to any person or department within
a facility.  The EPA's position, therefore, si that designation of an archivist is a management
function and has not been pre-selected by the Agency.  Since this detailed type of operation, both
for storage and retrieval, is similar to many tasks accomplished by the Q.A. staff, it may be
useful for a Q.A. person to be designated as archivist.<p>
<p>
<b>Question 2:</b> Originally, we maintained our experimental data in bound laboratory
notebooks
because we felt this would be the most exact way to record data.  Because we provide toxicology
services to numerous clients on a very irregular basis, we assigned notebooks to a scientist and
that scientist continued to use the notebook until it became filled.  Retrospectively, when
evaluating this practice, w felt it was a disadvantage since it results in original data for multiple
clients being contained within the same bound notebook.  For reporting purposes, photocopies of
all the raw data in the notebooks were included in the final report to the client.  To maintain
confidentiality, an individual from our laboratory must supervise the review of the original data
in the bound notebooks.  To eliminate this problem, we would like to unbind the notebooks and
add the original data sheets to the client's study file.  The original notebook sheets were properly
signed and dated at the time of the original data entry.  Do you feel this would be an acceptable
solution to the problem?<p>
<p>
<b>Response 2 (Dr. Goldman):</b>  The simplest answer is that only the bound notebook meets
the basic
GLP record keeping requirement -- all other issues, such as corrections, signoffs, etc., bing met. 
This is a management issue, not a compliance issue.  The more practical answer is that a bound
notebook is a legal instrument and is accordingly subpoenable; its integrity must be maintained. 
The original data, if collected in the fashion you described, are not to be distributed into the files
of separate clients; this would be a deviation from the requirements.  I suggest for you
consideration the use of bound and numbered patent-type notebooks in which each page is
identified by a printed notebook and page number and has a removable numbered copy page. 
The removable pages could be in the client file while the original pages would be archived in the
original bound notebooks for future audits.  While it may not be practical for your operation, I
have seen companies that use this type of bound book, generally containing 50 pages, for each
test regardless of the number of pages used. <p>
<p>
You would have to prepare an SOP detailing the use of these notebooks.  Such an SOP would
probably indicate how the termination of the experiment would be recorded so that the client
would be assured that no further data existed in the book.  Alternatively, if a continuation were
needed, this would have to be clearly indicated at the end of one run and at the start of another
since there would be a gap in page numbers in the client file.  For you own purposes, the SOP
should include the procedures to be followed if a client were to audit the original notebooks.<p>
<p>
<b>Question 3:</b> As our archives become filled, we would like to convert our raw data to
microfilm or
microfiche.  It is acceptable to microfilm the raw data and destroy the original record?  If so,
what steps should be taken for record verification?<p>
<p>
<b>Response 3 (Dr. Goldman):</b>  The GLP regulations [40 CFR 160.3] define "raw data" and
give
permission to copy records onto microfiche.  The problem comes in the certification that the
records, in their totality, have been so copied and that the copies are of the same quality as the
original [Section 160.190(b)].  In other words, this shifts the responsibility to Q.A. to oversee the
copying and to assure management that the copied record is totally complete and of proper
quality.  In any system of retention, you must take into account that some documents or of
non-standard size (chromatogram, etc.) And may offer some technical problems in microfiche
production.  You may ultimately decide that the result is not work the effort.  I have seen
laboratories that are in the process of putting all their paper records on microfiche and storing the
originals in a commercial location for retrieval should this be necessary.<p>
<p>
<b>Question 4:</b> According to the FDA interpretation of Good Laboratory Practices, certain
raw data
records are not study specific and need not be included in each study file retained in the archives
(e.g. test system rom temperature, humidity and light cycle records; instrument calibration
records).  Does your Agency agree with the FDA's interpretation on the inclusion of generic data
and records in the sponsor's study file?<p>
<p>
<b>Response 4 (Dr. Goldman): </b>We are in agreement with the FDA's interpretation as stated
in your
letter.  Your final report to the client will include these facility-related data (environmental

<h3>Regulatory Affairs Questions and Answers Column</h3>
<h3>By Jane M. Snell</h3>
</center>
<p>

The question and answer sessions at the annual SQA meeting appeared well represented by both
FDA and EPA personnel. There were many issues raised and if there are questions that some of
you would like official answers to, send them to me for either Dr. Lepore's or Dr. Goldman's
response. What about GCPs? GMPs?<p>

<p>

 Keep those cards and letters coming! As always, questions will appear under the auspices of the
SQA with no personal or company affiliation.<p>

<b>Question #1</b>:   Regarding the recent revisions to the FDA GLPs, if a protocol can be
written for
multiple species testing on the same test material, for example dual species toxicology testing, is
it also acceptable to include the findings of these studies in one final report?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #1 (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:  Yes it is, but please remember that the protocol and
the final
report must encompass only the common testing under the control of the same study
director.<p>

<p>

<b>Question #2</b>:  I have a question about final report amendments. We currently delete the
page(s)
in error and replace with a page that is stamped "corrected page" and dated in the upper right
hand corner. We have an amendment form that lists the pages affected, the type of change, i.e.,
correction, addition, revision and the reason for the changes. This form is signed by the study
director and included with the deleted pages in the back of the report. Do the original pages have
to be maintained as raw data and if the answer is yes, is it enough to include them in the report or
do they have to also be in the study file? Does each corrected page have to be signed/initialed by
the study director?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #2 (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>: The GLPs provide that corrections or additions to a
final report
be made as formal amendments. Accordingly, the original pages have to be maintained as raw
data. I prefer not to advise on the additional questions here since a variety of procedures can
satisfy the regulations.<p>

<p>

<b>Question #3</b>:  Would you elaborate on the agency's position of what constitutes an SOP
deviation
and what determines the difference between an "authorized" and "unauthorized" deviation? We
have an SOP Deviation Form as well as a Protocol Deviation Form that become part of the raw
data of a study but some study directors seem to have a problem with the term deviation and feel
that if it is authorized there doesn't need to be any list. Additionally, do these deviations have to
be indicated in the final report?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #3  (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:   Let's use some judgement here. The purpose of the
related
GLP provisions was to assure that the study director was aware of all SOP deviations and that a
conscious decision was made that the deviation did not adversely affect the study. Thusly [sic],
the study director must authorize all deviations. I do not see in the regulations a definition of
"unauthorized" deviation. I would use judgement on which deviations are discussed in the final
report.<p>

<p>

<b>Question #4</b>:  We have recently been audited by a third party and have been criticized
because
the study director and the clinical chemistry department director had not initialed raw data. The
auditors stated that we were not in compliance with GLPs because of this. All the raw data in
question was properly labeled and all work was initialed and dated by the technicians performing
the work. Is it necessary that the study director initial every piece of raw data that is generated
during the course of a study? What about department directors? Do they have to initial all raw
data that comes out of their respective laboratories? By the way, it was not a regulatory
inspection.<p>

<p>

<b>Response #4: (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:   It is not necessary for the study director or for
department
directors to initial every piece of raw data generated in a study. However, it is a study director
responsibility to assure that all experimental data are accurately recorded and verified. This can
be accomplished by periodic data reviews by the study and department directors. These periodic
reviews should be documented.<p>

<b>QUESTION #1</b>:  FDA Regulations, 21 CFR pt. 58.113 (b) indicate that a reserve
sample of the
test and/or control article should be taken for studies lasting longer than 4 weeks. Please clarify
the following with regard to the definition of "4 weeks<p>

<p>

a: Would a reserve sample be required when a study contains 29 or more days from initial test
article administration to the last day of sacrifice or does this apply to studies only when the test
article is administered for 29 or more days.<p>

<p>

b: If you define the start date of the study as the animal receipt date and the completion date as
the report submittal date (a period of 7 weeks) and the actual in-life portion of the study was only
14 days. is a reserve sample required?<p>

<p>

c: A study is designed to have 2 weeks of dosing with a week recovery period. Would a reserve
sample be required?<p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #1 (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:  FDA has never precisely defined the meaning of a
28 day/4
week study. preferring that the industry use terms currently appearing in the toxicology
literature. In this regard, the NTP uses the convention that the term of the study equals the
duration of dosing (test article administration). The answers, therefore, would be a., yes (after the
or); for b., no; for c., no.<p>

<p>

<b>QUESTION #2</b>:  Both TSCA &amp; FIFRA Regulations indicate that a reserve sample
of the test and/or control article should be taken for studies lasting longer than 4 weeks. Please
clarify the following with regard to the definition of "4 weeks".<p>

<p>

a: Would a reserve sample be required when a study contains 29 or more days from initial test
article administration to the last day of sacrifice or does this apply to studies only when the test
article is administered for 29 or more days.<p>

<p>

b: If you define the start date of the study as the animal receipt date and the completion date as
the report submittal date (a period of 7 weeks) and the actual in-life portion of the study was only
14 days, is a reserve sample required?<p>

<p>

c: A study is designed to have 2 weeks of dosing with a week recovery period. Would a reserve
sample be required?<p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #2 (Dr. Goldman, EPA)</b>: a:   We define a toxicity study in terms of the
length of
treatment time, not the length of treatment plus observation time. Here FIFRA 160.105(d) is
unclear. Our interpretation is that a 14-day or a 90-day subchronic test means one in which the
test animal receives the test chemical for 14 or 90 days, respectively. The pre-test and/or post test
observation periods are not taken into account.<p>

<p>

A reserve sample would be required if the study dosing period is 29 days or more. This would be
true even if the animals are not dosed on weekends or holidays.<p>

<p>

b: A reserve sample is not required for a 14-day subchronic test regard less of the definitions of
"start" and "completion" dates for the study.<p>

<p>

The GLP definitions of "start" and "completion" dates are given in FIFRA 160.3. We have added
new proposed definitions of "experimental start date" and "experimental termination date"
defined in terms of data gathering as opposed to protocol signing and final report dates. For
practical purposes we will use the animal receipt date as the start date and the end of pathology
as the termination date; this permits us to schedule in-life inspections in a more orderly fashion.
<p>

<p>

c: A reserve sample would not be required as the dosing period is less than 29 days.<p>

<p>
<b>QUESTION #3</b>:  According to 21 CFR pt. 58.35 (c), "The responsibilities and
procedures
applicable to the QAU, the records maintained by the QAU, and the method of indexing such
records shall be in writing and shall be maintained."<p>

<p>

Additionally, 58.195 (d), stipulates "The Master schedule sheet, copies of protocols, and records
of QA inspections as required by 58.35 (c) shall be maintained . . . for the period of time
specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.<p>

<p>

The responsibilities and procedures of the QAU are described in detail in the QA SOPs and are
retained historically as such. "QA inspection records as required" is difficult to understand as
there are many types of inspection records i.e., critical phase inspection reports, check sheets
used in reviewing certain portions of final reports and protocols as well as internal QA facility
inspection reports and site visit reports of QA inspections of off-site visits. Please answer the
following questions regarding the retention of QA records.<p>

<p>

a: What QA inspections records have to be retained?<p>

<p>

b: How long and under what conditions do these records have to be retained?<p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #3 (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:  FDA interprets sections 58.35 (c)  and 58.195(d)
quite
literally. We believe that all documents generated by the QAU should be retained under adequate
storage conditions for at least 5 years.<p>

<p>

<b>QUESTION #4</b>:  According to TSCA, pt.160.35(c) and FIFRA, pt.792.35(c), "The
responsibilities and procedures applicable to the QAU, the records maintained by the QAU, and
the method of indexing such records shall be in writing and shall be maintained." Additionally,
pts. 160.195 (d) and 792.195 (d), "The Master schedule sheet, copies of protocols, and records of
QA inspections . . . shall be maintained for the period of time specified in paragraphs . . . of this
section.<p>

<p>

The responsibilities and procedures of the QAU are described in detail in the QA SOPs and are
retained historically as such. "QA inspection records as required" is difficult to understand as
there are many types of inspection records i.e., critical phase inspection reports, check sheets
used in reviewing certain portions of final reports and protocols as well as internal QA facility
inspection reports and site visit reports of QA inspections of off-site visits. Please answer the
following questions regarding the retention of QA records.<p>

<p>

a: What QA inspections records have to be retained?<p>

<p>

b: How long and under what conditions do these records have to be retained?<p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #4 (Dr. Goldman, EPA)</b>:  Correspondent is incorrect. The GLP regulations
under
FIFRA are at 40 CFR 160, not 792 (which is for TSCA).<p>

<p>

QA records are study-specific and all QA records must be retained as raw data. The records to be
retained and made available are defined in the FIFRA G LP regulations at 160.35(c). In addition
to the list of study-specific items we would also like to be able to  inspect the QA master
schedule.  Section 160.35(d) defines the limits of our authority in discovering, under normal
conditions, the results of any inspections as well as follow-up actions taken by management. As
you are aware we do discuss how QA communicates problems to management as well as how
QA follows up to make sure that problems are dealt with but we do not ask to see actual QA
inspection reports.<p>

<p>

<b>QUESTION #5</b>: We record our gross observations at necropsy on necropsy forms and
the
prosector checks off the tissues taken in the necropsy column. The pathologist, after reading the
slides, will record diagnoses on a separate pathology sheet and check off the tissues read in the
corresponding path column on the necropsy sheet. Both sheets are signed and dated.<p>

<p>

<b>Question</b>: Can the pathologist edit the observations made by the prosector? If yes, under
what
circumstances and what is acceptable as a reason for change? Can observations be deleted?<p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #5 (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:  Section 58.130 of the GLPs permits changes in raw
data
provided that the original data are not obscured, that the change is signed and dated, and that a
reason for the change is given. Therefore, a pathologist may edit the observations made by a
prosector. l would, however, be very cautious about such editing since the reasons for the data
changes would have to be very persuasive. In this regard, l can think of no reason that would be
persuasive enough to permit data deletion.<p>

<p>

<b>QUESTION #6</b>:  How should changes to protocols be documented? What procedures
are
required to document "planned'' changes and inadvertent "errors"? Is sponsor approval required
to document both types of changes and what is the time frame required in obtaining this
approval?<p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #6 (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:  Protocol changes should be documented as formal
amendments issued by the study director. All "planned" changes (i.e., those changes having a
systematic effect on study conduct) should be so documented. Occasional failures to follow the
protocol (inadvertent errors) should be documented in the study records. Yes, sponsor approval
is required for all protocol amendments, and I believe it would be prudent for the laboratory to
discuss the occasional failures to follow the protocol with the sponsor. Sponsor approval should
be obtained prior to the implementation of all protocol amendments. There are times, however,
when an amendment must be implemented rapidly, and, in such cases, sponsor approval may be
obtained by telephone. <p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #6 (Dr. Goldman, EPA)</b>:   The basic requirement for a protocol is found at
Section
160.120 (a) which includes the term, "Each study shall have an approved written protocol . . .".
This protocol will be signed by both the study director and the test sponsor. Section 160.33 states
that the study director must approve changes to the protocol. This is repeated in section 160.120
(b) which states that all changes are to be approved by the study director. While not specifically
required, we believe it to be prudent to obtain the sponsor's approval for any changes to the
protocol. In line with current industry practice. we have interpreted the protocol change
terminology as follows:<p>

<p>

a: A planned and permanent change to a protocol is an amendment which should be documented
as a protocol amendment, dated and signed by both the study director and the test sponsor. An
amendment represents a decision to make a change in the conduct of the study and like ail
change must show the reason for the change.<p>

<p>

b: A protocol deviation may be defined as a one-time unplanned deviation from the planned
protocol and may be the result of an accident or error and is not expected to continue. A
deviation might include results of weather related damage to the facility or a missed weighing
date or a dosage error. These are clearly not discussed in advance with the test sponsor or
approved in advance by the study director. They are to be documented by the study director and
some notation should be present to show that the test sponsor was advised as to the deviation.
The study director might add some comments as to the possible significance, if any, of the
deviation to the outcome or to the interpretation of the study.<p>

<p>

<b>QUESTION #7</b>:  Regarding the recent revisions to the FDA GLPs, if a protocol can be
written
for multiple species testing on the same test material, for example dual species toxicology
testing, is it also acceptable to include the findings of these studies in one final report?<p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #7 (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:  Yes it is, but please remember that the protocol and
the
final report must encompass only the common testing under the control of the same study
director.<p>

<p>

<b>QUESTION #8</b>:  I have a question about final report amendments. We currently delete
the
page(s) in error and replace with a page that is stamped "corrected page" and dated in the upper
right hand corner. We have an amendment form that lists the pages affected, the type of change,
i.e., correction, addition, revision and the reason for the changes. This form is signed by the

final
report be made as formal amendments. Accordingly, the original pages have to be maintained as
raw data. l prefer not to advise on the additional questions here since a variety of procedures can
satisfy the regulations<p>

<p>

<p>

 Here we are again with some interesting questions. The pickings were pretty slim this month so
I would appreciate input from my fellow QA professionals. All questions are answered under the
auspices of the SQA without personal or company affiliation. Send questions to:<p>

<p>
Jane M. Snell<br>

<p>

<b>QUESTION #1</b>:  The amended FDA GLP regulations now specifically exclude from
retention
requirements specimens obtained from mutagenicity tests. Our laboratory is having difficulty in
determining if slides or plates generated from mutagenicity studies (i.e. slides from metaphase
chromosome spreads from in-vivo and in-vitro cytogenetics assays; stained plates from cell
transformation assays; DNA repair autoradiography slides) are considered specimens and
therefore can be discarded after evaluation and recording. Please clarify this issue.<p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #1 (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:  FDA's amended regulations exempt from the
retention
requirements all specimens derived from mutagenicity tests. Therefore, the example specimens
listed in the question may all be discarded after evaluation, recording, and the conduct of any
planned quality assurance procedure.<p>

<p>

<b>QUESTION #2</b>:  When a consultant, i.e. an ophthalmologist, is needed to perform
specialized
eye evaluations for an eye study, and he/she brings their own equipment, what is the
responsibility of the Test Facility regarding the SOPs? This would be a one-time study and the
ophthalmologist considered an expert.<p>

<p>

<b>RESPONSE #2 (Dr. Lepore, FDA)</b>:  The GLPs are quite clear about the requirements
for
standard operating procedures covering equipment used in a study. The facility would have to
assure that the equipment is used in accord with the relevant sections of the GLPs, and that there
are adequate standard operating procedures describing such use. The frequency of study conduct
and the expertise of the consultant have no bearing on the GLP requirements <p>

<b>LD50 TEST POLICY</b><p>
</center>
<p>

 The Food and Drug Administration published a notice in the Federal Register (October 11,
1988, pp. 39650-51) which states the agency's general policy that the "classical" LD50 test is not
required by the FDA for determining the safety of any compound under its jurisdiction and its
use is not part of any agency testing policy.<p>

<p>

 Previously, a consortium of animal rights groups headed by the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals had petitioned the FDA to issue regulations banning the use of
the "classical" LD50 test and refusing to accept data generated by that method. Although the
FDA denied the petition, the current notice makes plain that while acute toxicity information is
required, the "classical" LD50 test is not.<p>

<p>

 It should be noted that this notice is limited to the "classical" LD50 test which the agency
defined as a test that "requires large numbers of animals (usually rodents) ranging from 60 to
more than 120 animals per test substance."<p>

<h3> RETENTION OF TEST ARTICLE CONTAINERS</h3>
</center>
<p>
Date: 6th May 1988<p>
Dear Paul,<br>
<p>
Many thanks for your explanation of the recent FDA revisions to their GLP requirements which
you presented at the QAG Congress in Stratford.  As I indicated in my question at the time, there
is a particular point on retention of test article containers on which I would like clarification.<p>

<p>

We at Fisons carry out a significant number of Toxicology studies on aerosol preparations.  The
method of presentation to the animal is to use individual aerosol cans as formulated for the
eventual clinical use.  Multiples of six cans are actuated at set time intervals to discharge into a
chamber where the animals under test are exposed for periods up to four hours per day.  The
cloud density of the test article in this chamber is monitored at regular intervals.  During the
course of a long term study a considerable number of aerosol cans are used, in the region of
30,000 to 40,000.<p>

<p>

There is no original test article container for the formulated cans, as implied in the GLP
regulations, only the individual cans.  There is, however, the original compound container from
which the cans are formulated.  My question to you at the congress was, do we have to retain all
40,000 cans as original containers?  Now that you have had more time to consider this point
could you give me your conclusion on what procedure we should adopt to meet this requirement
in the GLP regulations?<br>

<p>

Kind regards,<br>

Yours sincerely,<p>

<b> Response</b><p>
May 17, 1988<p>
Dear Graham<p>
<p>
I thank you for your letter of May 6, which requests clarification of my answer to the question
asked at the recent QAG Congress.<p>

In the situation that you describe, the aerosol cans would be considered as containers for the test
article-carrier mixture and the original compound container would be considered as the container
for the test article.  The GLPs require, therefore, the retention of the original compound container
for the duration of the study.<p>

It is unfortunate that I did not fully understand your question at the congress and I believe that
certain of the attendees may have been left with the wrong impression.  Accordingly, I would
appreciate you sending your letter and this response to Bryan Doherty for publication in the next
QAG newsletter. <p>

I thank you for your support of FDA's programs and for your assistance in clarifying this
matter.<p>

Sincerely yours,<p>

<h3>Regulatory Affairs Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>

By Jane Snell<p>

</center>
<p>

<hr>
<p>

  Please join me in welcoming David Dull, Director Laboratory Data Integrity Assurance
Division, EPA, who will respond to questions of EPA concern. Dr. Paul Lepore, Bioresearch
Program Coordinator, FDA, will continue to answer questions dealing with FDA GLP issues. As
usual, all questions will be answered under the auspices of the SQA without personal or
company affiliation. All questions for this column should be submitted to Jane Snell, TSI Mason
Research Institute, 57 Union St., Worcester, MA 01608.<p>

<p>

  Questions 1 - 4 were responded to by <b>Dr. Paul Lepore</b>, U.S. FDA.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question  1</b>: We conducted a tox study and submitted a final report to the sponsor over
6
months ago. At that time the sponsor wanted all study materials (raw data, wet specimens, test
materials, etc.) returned to them. This was indicated in the study protocol and stated in the final
report. However, when we sent them a letter of intent to ship the materials, the letter came back
4 months later asking us to keep the materials at our archives as they had run out of space. Does
the protocol and final report have to be amended or can documentation as to the placement be
put in the study file?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response 1</b>: It is satisfactory to include a statement on the current location of the
"study
materials" in the study file.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question 2</b>: Does each page of a protocol amendment have to be signed/initialed if it is
paginated 1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc.?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 2</b>: No.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question 3</b>: Recently some of our Japanese clients have enquired about QA being
responsible
for the archives. Apparently there is some concern in Japan as to this being a conflict of interest.
To my knowledge, chapter VIII, Article 28 of the Japanese GLP standards does not restrict who
is responsible for the archives, but only states that an individual must be designated as such. I
would appreciate any insights that you (or anyone else) might have on this matter.<p>

<p>

  <b>Response 3:</b> Although this issue arose in some early discussions with our MOU
counterparts in
the United Kingdom, I do not recall ever discussing it with the officials of the Japanese Ministry
of Health and Welfare. At any rate, it is FDA's position that the archivist can be located within
the Quality Assurance Unit.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question 4</b>: A study director submitted a signed draft protocol to one of our sponsors
for
approval. The sponsor signed the draft protocol, made hand written changes (initialed and dated)
and returned it to the study director. Should the protocol be reissued and resigned or is it ok for
the study director to indicate on the draft protocol that it is the official approved study protocol,
even though it says draft.<p>

<p>

  <b>Response 4</b>: I would opt for indicating that the draft is the official approved
protocol.<p>

<p>

<hr>
<p>

  Questions 5 - 7 were responded to by<b> Dr. David Dull</b>, U.S. EPA.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question 5</b>: It is unclear in the FDA &amp; EPA GLPs whether or not a study protocol
can allow
multiple test articles to be applied simultaneously but on different sites on the same animal (i.e.,
for an acute dermal irritation). Is it allowable?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 5</b>: The EPA GLPs cannot be looked to for an answer to this question. Rather
the
issue is what test protocols for this type of study will permit. To answer this question, it would
be necessary to consult scientific staff in EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) or Office of
Toxic Substances (OTS). Each office has its own test guidelines and standards (40 CFR Part 158
for OPP; 40 CFR 798 for OTS) that presumably would provide guidance.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question 6</b>: Where can a list be obtained of cleaning agents (for cage washers, room
sanitization, etc.) which are acceptable to the FDA and EPA? How can we determine if what we
are currently using is FDA and/or EPA approved?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 6</b>: EPA does not maintain a list of "approved" products in this or any other
area of
laboratory operations. It is the laboratory's responsibility to determine whether the products and
equipment it uses meet the performance standards implicit or explicit in the kinds of testing it is
performing. The reader is referred to the preamble to the 1983 GLPs under the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) for the guidance of the FIFRA Scientific
Advisory Panel on the question of cleaning and pest control materials. 48 Federal Register 53962
(Nov. 29, 1983).<p>

<p>

<b>  Question 7</b>: Our facility archives for paper and specimens has reached capacity and we
are
considering off site storage. So long as the storage company we use meets our environmental
storage conditions, can provide us with inventory/material location listings in their facility and
has restricted access, does the FDA or EPA foresee any difficulties with this? We plan to keep
copies of the final reports and a copy of the computer report from the storage company in an
archive file at our facility. We also plan to make quarterly visits (is this excessive) to check the
place out.<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 7</b>: The GLPs under both FIFRA and the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA) are
quite explicit regarding the question of contracting with a commercial archiving firm. Both
regulations state: "A testing facility may contract with commercial archives to provide a
repository for all material to be retained. Raw data and specimens may be retained elsewhere
provided that the archives have specific reference to these other locations."  40 CFR Part
160.190(b) and 40 CFR Part 792.190 (b)<p>

<p>

  A response to a comment In the preamble to the FIFRA GLP regulation at 54 Federal Register
34066 (August 17,1989) is equally specific stating: "The test facility may contract with a
commercial archives under section 160.195(b) and (g). This implies flexibility in the physical
location of the archives."<p>

<p>

  However, archives, no matter where located, must conform to the basic requirements in the
GLP regulations regarding access, indexing, etc. Persons responsible for maintaining data and
specimens must assure themselves that these requirements are being met.<p>

<p>

  It should also be noted that when EPA conducts a GLP inspection, or audits a study, it will
insist that ail relevant raw data and specimens be at the location of the inspection/audit for the
duration of the Inspection/audit or at least readily retrievable when needed. <p>

<h3>Regulatory Affairs Questions and Answers</h3>
</center>
<p>

  I was glad to see all those new faces at the SQA Annual Meeting in Orlando. A lot of
interesting questions were asked of the regulatory people and the clarification gained from the
answers was informative for all. I encourage all of you that have questions of regulatory concern
to take advantage of the official platform this column offers. Representatives of the FDA and
EPA will respond to these questions without benefit of personal or company affiliation, so please
send those questions to:<p>

<p>

Jane M. Snell <br>
QA Manager <br>
TSI Mason Research Institute <br>
57 Union Street <br>
Worcester, MA 01608<br>
<p>

  <b>Question #1</b>: We have maintained a group of primates for use by a single sponsor for
the past
year and a half, and we have conducted several studies using these animals (some of which have
been GLP studies). The animals underwent a quarantine period upon arrival and once released
from quarantine, the primates were placed in holding until assignment to a study. My questions
is this: Should the environmental data that has been maintained during quarantine and holding
for these animals (temperature and humidity data, food usage, observations, etc.) be included in
the respective study file once the animals are assigned to a GLP study?<p>

<p>

  <b>Dr. Paul Lepore's Response</b>: The GLPs do not require that records and data stored in
the
archives be kept in "study" files. You are free to develop and use any filing system whatsoever
provided that it permits orderly storage and expedient retrieval and that it is appropriately
indexed. Consequently, it is not necessary to store laboratory environmental data in the same file
as study data.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #2:</b> Can Dr. Lepore clarify the difference between a component (reagent) of a
medical device and a finished product (reagent) when the medical device is a diagnostic kit? I
understand that this involves GMP issues, but I'm hoping he can help straighten this out. If not,
can he provide me with references to contact?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response 2</b>: I'd be happy to help out. The following was sent to me by Mr. Z. Frank
Twardochleb, who is the Acting Chief of the Manufacturing Quality Assurance Branch of FDA's
Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Franks says he will be pleased to answer other
questions in this area as well.<p>

<p>

  "An IVD component is viewed as any individual reagent or instrument which, by itself, is not
capable of providing any meaningful diagnostic information when applied to a clinical specimen.
Useful diagnostic information can be provided only when the above is integrated with other
individual components so that there is collective interaction in a prescribed manner of all
reagents and instruments with a clinical specimen.<p>

<p>

  Because components can also be finished devices, it may be useful to distinguish between
components that are offered as "raw material" in contrast to components that are offered
"ready-to-use." An individual reagent is viewed as a raw material if it requires further
manipulation by the laboratorian prior to its use in a diagnostic procedure to the extent that the
reagent's physical, biological or chemical properties are significantly changed.<p>

<p>

  A component that is "ready-to use" in a given diagnostic procedure (i.e., in conjunction with
other reagents) by the laboratory is viewed as a finished device. Our concept of a "ready-to-use"
component could include the reconstitution and dilution of a reagent, i.e., a lyophilized reagent
prior to use in a given test system.<p>

<p>

  The type of submission to be submitted by a manufacturer of a finished component will depend
on (1) the regulatory classification of the generic device class for which the finished component
is a part, and (2) the degree of importance of the component in a particular diagnostic
procedure.<p>

<h3>Veterinary Issues Column</h3>
<p>

</center>
  Dr. Tim Mandrell, Senior Staff Veterinarian of the Animal Care Staff at the USDA Central
Office in Hyattsville, Maryland, had agreed to answer any questions you many have regarding
the Animal Welfare Act or related issues. His address and phone number are:<p>

Dr. Timothy Mandrell Sr. Staff Veterinarian Animal Care Staff USDA Regulatory Enforcement

436-7833<p>

<p>

  The following questions are posed without individual or company attribution.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question # 1</b>: Do you feel it constitutes a conflict of interest if a member of the Quality
Assurance Unit serves on the IACUC? Some individuals argue that the QAU inspects all aspects
of facility operation, including adherence to Animal Welfare Regulations, and should thus not be
on the IACUC.<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #1</b>: From the APHIS regulatory perspective, a member of the facility's
Quality
Assurance Unit could serve on the IACUC without constituting a conflict of interest. A conflict
of interest, however, would exist if the QAU were over represented (more than 3 members) on
the IACUC or if the institutional official appointed a member of the QAU to serve as the
unaffiliated or outside member of the Committee. It is important to remember that the
Institutional Official appoints the IACUC and the minimum requirements for the Committee, as
per Section 2.31 (b) of the regulations, include a Chairman, the Attending Veterinarian, and an
unaffiliated member.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #2</b>: Can you comment on the proposed changes to the Animal Welfare
Regulations?
When and in what form will these take effect?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #2</b>: Over 11,000 comments were received on the proposed regulations for
dogs, cats,
and nonhuman primates that were published in the August 15, 1990 Federal Register. The
comments will be analyzed and considered in drafting the final rules. We hope that final rules
will be published some time in 1991.<p>

<p>

 <b>Question #3</b>: Is a facility which performs only agricultural research using farm animals
exempt
from the regulations? What if the substance tested is destined for use in other than farm animals?
What about facilities performing research using rodents in order to test medications, etc.,
destined for farm animals?<p>

<p>

 <b>Response #3:</b> Farm animals used in agricultural research such as animal nutrition,
breeding
management, production efficiency, etc., are excluded by the AWA. Farm animals used in
biomedical research are covered by the AWA and the authority to include these animals in the
regulations was issued in June of 1990. If the research conducted on farm animals is not for
agricultural purposes, the animals would be covered by the regulations. Non-farm animals other
than those excluded by the regulations or the AWA, are covered by the regulations regardless of
the type of research or the product being tested. <p>

  <b>Dr. Paul Lepore</b>, U.S. FDA has responded to all of the following questions. All
questions
appear under the auspices of the SQA with no personal or company affiliation. Send inquiries
to:<p>

<p>

Jane M. Snell, TSI Mason Research Institute, 57 Union Street, Worcester, MA 01608<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #1</b>: For a validated computer system to which no hardware or software
changes have
been made, is there a recommended time period for revalidation (e.g., one year)? If there is no
recommended period, is there a time period which is the "standard" used by many GLP
laboratories?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response #1:</b> The regulations do not specify time intervals for the periodic validation
of
computer systems used to support nonclinical laboratory studies. In this regard, l have no
information on the "standards" which are in general practice.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #2:</b> An investigational test material undergoes an extraction procedure to test
for
leachables. The resulting extraction solution is then used as a test material in a GLP study. Does
the extracted test solution need to be characterized and have stability information for the study
period if the Study Director wishes to run this as a GLP study?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #2</b>: You bet!<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #3</b>: Are there any documents available from FDA that would contain
guidelines or
references to acceptable methods for conducting immunotoxicology studies? We are aware of the
OECD Guidelines and have followed them in the past. Does FDA have something similar?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #3</b>: I have checked with the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the
Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. None
of these have issued guidelines for evaluating immunotoxicity.<p>

<p>

 <b>Question #4: </b>The FDA GLPs indicate that QA records can basically be discarded once
the
applicable study records themselves have fulfilled the storage requirements.  However, recently
and from several colleagues, I have been told that the Agency has been inquiring as to the status
of these records Please comment and put a rumor to rest.<p>

<p>

 <b>Response #4</b>: I never cease to be amazed at the inquisitive nature of FDA's
investigators It is
entirely possible that the status of quality assurance records is being questioned during a GLP
inspection. The GLPs, however, provide that these records are to be retained for the time periods
specified in Section 58.195. <p>

<p>

 I have several questions with responses from Dr. Paul Lepore of the FDA. If any of you have
any questions that you would like an official agency response for, send them along to me. All
questions appear under the auspices of the SQA with no personal or company affiliation. Send
inquires to: <p>

Jane M. Snell  TSI Mason Laboratories  <br>
57 Union Street <br>
Worcester, MA 01608<br>
<p>

<b> Question #1</b>: In performing physical and chemical characterization studies to meet
requirements
of the FDA,  is a testing facility required to perform those studies, e. g. density, in full GLP
compliance, including QA audits of the in process critical phases?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #1</b>: Certainly.<p>

<p>

<b>Questions #2</b>: Should the Master Schedule maintained by QAU include nonclinical
studies
conducted by foreign affiliates or licensors for investigational products under U S. IND?<p>

<p>

<b> Response #2</b>: No  <p>

 <b>Question #3</b>: Is there a conflict of interest when the QA has input into protocol
preparation?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #3</b>: No.  <p>

<b> Questions #4: This is a two-part question</b>.     <p>

<b> 4a</b>. Does a protocol have 2 test articles when the objective of the study is to compare
the
effectiveness when used together and singly?<p>

<p>

 <b>4b</b>. In a study that implants a cell line, treats some animals with a known
chemotherapeutic
agent and then a test article, the objective is twofold, to determine the effectiveness of the test
article alone and to determine the possible enhancement capabilities of the test article upon the
chemotherapeutic agent.  In this case, for the protocol, is the chemotherapeutic agent a test
article? Should the cell line be treated as a reagent of sorts?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #4: WOW!   <p>

<p>

4a.</b>  Yes, but do recall that effectiveness studies on FDA regulated products are generally
exempt
from GLP requirements.<p>

<p>

<b> 4b.</b> My comment, above holds here, too. The question is some what obtuse and I would
prefer
clarification before answering. I have seen instances when cell lines have been considered to be
test systems as defined in the GLPs.  Also, there are examples of products of cell lines being
used considered as reagents.    <p>

<p>

<b>Clarification 4b</b>: The sponsor has requested that the study be GLP. A leukemia cell line
will be
implanted into all animals; there will be a positive control group [animals implanted with cell
line], a group treated with the known chemotherapeutic agent alone, a group treated with the
known chemotherapeutic agent and the test article, and a group treated with the test article alone.
The feeling is that the test article would be the designated TA in the protocol with the cell line
being listed as a reagent and having the necessary viability data.<p>

<p>

<b> Response 4b</b>.  Clarification: In  given example, the chemotherapeutic agent is a control
article
and the cell line is treated as a reagent.<p>

  The following is a list of questioned directed to and answered by Dr. Paul Lepore, U.S. FDA.
All questions appear under the auspices of the SQA with no personal or company affiliation. If
you have any questions that you would like an agency response for, send the inquires to:<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #1</b>: In recent months, many companies have been under the impression that
SAS
programs do not need to be validated. The major reason is that the FDA uses SAS and it has
been set as the "industry standard."  Do all applications of SAS used for GLP and clinical studies
need to be validated? We are under the impression that any given SAS as procedure (e.g., PROC
GLM) does not require formal validation of its output. Is this true?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response # 1</b>: I will never admit that any computerized program does not require
validation
sufficient to prove fitness for use In the GLP area, however, system validation is absolutely
required whenever the system is used to capture raw data whenever it has the potential to impact
on the integrity of the raw data It is my understanding that SAS programs perform neither of
these activities and that they are used to statistically analyze the data, and perhaps, format the
data into tables, charts, and graphs am much less concerned about this since the integrity of the
raw data will not be affected. Accordingly, l don't believe that the GLP's apply to the use of SAS
programs<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #2</b>: Is it sufficient to have just an SOP to list storage conditions and
expiration dates
of all reagents used or must there be a label affixed to a storage container noting this
information? Could the label container just reference the appropriate SOP?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #2</b>: The regulations are quite specific in requiring that the label of each
container of a
chemical or a reagent contain information which includes the expiration date and storage
requirements.<p>

<p>

  Editors note: Also refer to specific Federal/State laws for your area, and OSHA 29 CFR
1910.1450.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #3</b>: If a sponsor of a GLP nonclinical study collects and records raw data of
the study,
is the study truly considered to be verifiable data? And what role should the QA Unit take in this
matter?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #3</b>: I have seen instances where sponsors will perform portions of studies In
this
case, the sponsor must assure that appropriate quality assurance unit surveillance takes place;
this can be through the operations of the sponsors or if the findings from the sponsor's study
portions are appropriately communicated to the study director. <p>

<h3>Ask Your Regulatory Review Committee</h3>
</center>
<p>

  The following is a list of questions directed to and answered by Dr. Paul Lepore, U.S. FDA. All
questions appear under the auspices of the SQA with no personal or company affiliation. If you
or your company have any other questions please complete the blue RRC Question and
Comment Form and return as directed on the form.<p>

<p>

 <b>Question #1</b>:.  Company A is the sponsor for toxicokinetic study in rats given the test
article
orally for two weeks. Company B will conduct the in-life phase of the study (e.g. dosing,
recording of body weight data and collection of plasma samples). The plasma samples will be
sent to Company A for analysis and interpretation of results. Which company designates the
Study Director and should the Study Director be present at company A, Company B or both
during the course of the study?<p>

<p>

<b> Answer #1</b>:  Whereas the regulations are not clear on this matter (sic), I have always
advised
that the Study Director be located at the site where the test system is maintained. My reasons are
that, of the six major assurances that the Study Director must provide [Section 58.33(a) (f)],
three specifically require day to day control of the test system [Section 58.33 (b), (c), and (d)].
These can only be accomplished by an on-site Study Director.<p>

<p>

 <b>Question #2</b>:  Company A is the sponsor for a drug metabolism study in rats given
radiolabeled
test article orally for 7 consecutive days. Company B will conduct the in-life phase of the study
(e.g. dosing and collection of urine, feces. and tissues) and will analyze all tissues for radioactive
content (balance portion of the study). Excreta and tissues will be shipped to Company A for
extraction and identification of major metabolites and profiling of metabolites in tissues and
excreta. Is it acceptable (within GLP compliance) to issue separate protocols for the in-life and
analytical phases with separate Study Directors who will each issue a separate report?<p>

<p>

<b> Answer #2</b>:  No. The regulations do not accommodate multiple, independent Study
Directors
for a single study. The use of the singular in Section 58.33 is intentional.<p>

<p>

<b> Question #3</b>:  Is vendor validation of a computer program ever acceptable or does the
user
always have to do validation at their site? If yes, under what conditions?<p>

<p>

<b> Answer #3</b>:  Vendor validation is always acceptable and is to be encouraged. Usually,
when
purchased systems are installed at a user site, validation activities (in addition to acceptance
testing) will have to be performed to assure that installation in the user environment does not
compromise the validity of the system as developed by the vendor and to accommodate any
system requirements requested by the user.<p>

<p>

<b> Question #4</b>:  When a sponsor requires more testing to be done on specimens from a
completed
study, which gets amended, the protocol, the report, or both.<p>

<p>

 <b>Answer #4</b>:  Both<p>

<p>

<b> Question #5</b>:  How much detail should go into checking scientific journal references
used in a
protocol or final report? Must the QA question the scientific expertise of the Study Director in
his choice of support documentation? Must the QA read every article referenced and
scientifically agree that it is an appropriate reference and the Study Director is validly using
it?<p>

<p>

 <b>Answer #5:</b>  Looks like you need an NFL Referee to work this one out. The regulations
are
silent on these issues.<p>

<p>

<b> Questions #6a</b>:  When the regulations state the final report include a description of the
methods
used, may we just include a statement declaring standard procedures in effect at the time were
followed? If not, then is it adequate to list all appropriate standard procedure numbers in the
appendix of the report or is it necessary to cite all standard procedures in the text of the report in
the order in which they occur?<p>

<p>

 <b>Answer #6a</b>:  I don't think it is enough to provide just a list of standard operating
procedures.
The final report should include sufficient description of a procedure to permit a subject matter
specialist to conclude that the procedure was appropriate for the measured parameter.<p>

<p>

<b> Question #6b</b>:  Why is the pathology report exempt from having to put standard
procedures in
their reports? The pathology reports from contract laboratories never list the procedures but
make a statement that SOPs in effect at the time were used.<p>

<p>

   <b>Answer #6b</b>:  See my answer to 6a. The pathology report should include sufficient
detail on
procedures to allow a determination of their adequacy.<p>

<p>

 <b>Question #7</b>:  As an independent group within a corporation that provides a quasi
contract
testing service to several divisions within the corporation: When conducting a study, can we
state that the sponsoring division will be responsible for preparation of the test article stability
report for submission? This would leave the responsibility of preparation of the stability report in
the hands of the division and not the Study Director as the stability of the test materials is usually
performed by a different group which is usually a part of the sponsoring division. Most contract
labs who perform preclinical studies for FDA submission are not responsible for preparation of
the stability report. These contract laboratories generally submit their reports without the
inclusion of stability information and merely state that it is the responsibility of the sponsor. Can
we issue the toxicology report totally independent of the test article stability report instead of
having it as an appendix?<p>

<p>

<b> Answer #7</b>:  Yes, yes. In this situation, however, it will be essential for the final report
to state
that the findings and conclusions therein are dependent upon an adequate showing of
stability.<p>

<p>

<b> Question #8</b>: What is the responsibility of the Study Director for the parts of a study
that are not
under the Study Director's jurisdiction (i.e. stability report, material formulation, etc.) other than
coordination? Since the final report will contain reports from other support groups (i.e.
pathology or statistical reports), what responsibility does the Study Director have to make sure
the support group's report is accurate? In many instances, the Study Director may not have the
opportunity to review the report even though it will be attached as an appendix. What about
when multiple report authors are involved (statistical report, stability report, etc.) and each has a
report attached as an appendix to the toxicology report?<p>

<p>

<b>Answer #8</b>:  The Study Director is responsible for the technical conduct of the entire
study
(Section 58.33). This would include accuracy of the reports of supporting scientists. I trust,
therefore, that the Study Director would particularly scrutinize all information, data, and views
that are associated with a study.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question 1)</b>  Should original/certified copies of equipment maintenance/calibration
logs and test
substance logs pertinent to a specific study to be archived at the completion of that study? Host
labs only do this annually, biannually, etc. <p>

<p>

     <b>Answer 1)</b>  Dr. Dull indicated that technically it is a GLP violation if originals or
certified copies
of equipment logs are not archived prior to the study director signing the compliance statement.
One SQA member indicated that their SOP stated that they copy and archive equipment records
annually. Another SQA member's logbooks were archived upon completion. Although
technically a GLP violation, the practice of copying logbooks for every study may be
impractical.<p>

<p>

     <b>Question 2)</b>  Are SOPs and maintenance logs required for instruments that do
not generate a
number? For example: magnetic stirrers, warmers, sonicators, vortexes, etc.<p>

<p>

     <b>Answer 2)</b>   Dr. Dull's opinion is that SOPs should be available for equipment
that can
malfunction and affect study integrity, whether it actually generated data or not. However, if
equipment does not generate a number, and malfunction would not affect study integrity, an SOP
is not necessarily required. Most subcommittee members concurred.<p>

     <b>Question 3)</b>  The Regulatory Review Bulletin stated LDIAD's position was that
protocol
deviations, if addressed with a degree of timeliness, need not be reported on the GLP statement.
This contradicts Phyllis Flaherty's edict of the FIFRA GLP conference Sept. 9-10, 1992, in
which she stated that protocol changes that are not authorized by the study director constitute a
GLP violation of 160.130 (a) until the time the study director approves them; i.e., that period of
time has to be reported on the GLP statement. This lack of consistency causes concern. Who is
the ultimate  authority? <p>

<p>

     <b>Answer 3)</b>  Dr. Dull indicated that if Agency GLP interpretations are not in
writing (i.e.
advisories), then they are not official policy. The bottom line is that protocol deviations, if
addressed according to GLP, do not have to be listed in the compliance statement. The EPA
auditors will likely not be concerned about this issue.<p>

     <b>Question 4)</b> An outside QA consultant has reviewed "the Company" package
and has made the
following comments.<p>

<p>

 a) The fundamental issue is that "the Company" conducted multiple studies under multiple
protocols; EPA requires the submission for a technical product be formatted according to
PR86-5. The format required is that certain studies be submitted as a single report volume. Since
the
EPA will not allow a deviation from the reporting format there is an inherent conflict.<p>

<p>

 b) The organization of the existing study reports is that required by EPA. Had "the Company"
written protocols and conducted studies with a view to the reporting format requirements there
would be no problem. <p>

 <p>

  c) The consultant's suggestion is that rather than attempt to write around the conundrum in the
GLP statement, make revisions to the reports to reflect the fact that they are compilations and are
not study reports.<p>

<p>

 d) Thus, the title heading would be changed from "the Company" "Report" to Compilation"; the
introduction would be revised to note that the submission volumes are compilations which
summarize individual study reports, the studies were conducted in accordance with GLP
directives, and the individual study reports will be kept in the study file by the Company. The
GLP statement could then be written to say something such as, "The data and procedures
reported were gathered from studies which were conducted in accordance with GLP as
per...".<p>

<p>

 e) The body of the now existing reports would remain as is, and would be acceptable, since EPA
allows formatting requirements to take precedence over GLP regulations. The recommended
changes would be a best effort to reflect the fact that "the Company" did not set up the program
most appropriately in the first place, and the submission to EPA has to be written as if the studies
had been set up appropriately.<p>

<p>

<b>  Answer 4)</b>   The committee felt that there was insufficient detail in the question to
provide an
accurate answer. However, multiple reports have been submitted under a single submission
package and were not considered by EPA to be in violation of either PR86-5 or GLP.<p>

     <b>Question 5)</b>  Our question concerns amended final reports and their impact on
compliance
statements. Is it standard practice to reissue a new compliance statement with an amended final
report? We have situations where the original study director was no longer employed by our
organization when the client requested changes to the final report. The amendment to the final
report included designation of a new study director, assigned by management, along with
changes requested by the client. The original compliance statement was removed and replaced
with a new one, signed by the new study director. A concern was voiced because the new study
director now took full responsibility for a study in which he or she had no active rule during its
conduct. Rather than initiating a new compliance statement, would it be acceptable to clarify in
the amendment whether the changes have any impact on the original compliance statement,
which would be retained and resubmitted with the amended final report as a verified exact copy?
<p>

<p>

     <b>Answer 5)</b>  This situation was handled correctly, the protocol should be
amended to change the
study director and a new compliance statement issued. However, the old compliance statement
and old pages must be retained.<p>

     <b>Question 6)</b>  Can non-study specific inspections be conducted on procedures
(soil
characterization, etc.) to support QA auditing requirements, or does each "procedure" of every
study have to be audited individually? <p>

<p>

<b>  Answer 6)</b>  Non study specific process inspections may be conducted on
"procedures" used in a
study (soil characterization, water analysis, etc.), and as long as each "study" is inspected at
intervals adequate to ensure the integrity of the study, GLPs are not violated. The required
inspections will typically be conducted during the field or analytical phase of the study.<p>

 <p>

<b>Regulatory Review - EPA Liaison Report</b><p>

</center>
<p>

     On Tuesday, April 19, 1994, the RRC quarterly liaison meeting was held with
Dr. David Dull of the EPA. Dr Dull was asked various questions that had been
submitted by the general SQA membership.<p>

<p>

    The following is my report on this liaison meeting. It contains the questions
asked as well as a summary of Dr. Dull's responses.  This report is being provided
to the SQA membership to help keep everyone informed and up-to-date on current
GLP issues.<p>

<p>

    Please note the responses are Dr. Dull's reported opinions and interpretations on
the issues. They should not be considered as official EPA policy, such as
Advisories. These responses, like Advisories, may depend on individual
circumstances and should be evaluated carefully to determine if they are applicable
to a situation. In many cases, there is more than one way to accomplish compliance
with GLP regulations.<p>

<p>

    <b>Question #1</b>: In some facilities, a management representative (e.g., General
Manager) checks data to assure that systems are being followed and that data is
accurate. Does this imply study conduct involvement, if the facility does not
consider this to be part of the study or part of QA responsibilities?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #1</b>: Oversight by management is encouraged by EPA because it shows
that management cares about the quality, integrity, and compliance of the data
being generated.  This type of data checking would probably not be considered part
of the study conduct. However, there may be situations where the data checking
could be interpreted as part of study conduct.  For example, if SOP or protocol
requires peer review and the checking is substituted for the peer review.<p>

<p>

    <b>Question #2</b>: Does EPA consider every other year to be adequate for contract
facility inspections for the best facilities?<p>

<p>

<b>    Answer #2</b>: EPA does not have an "official" response to this question. However,
Dr. Dull indicated that a plan should be written stating the frequency of facility
inspections. The plan should include criteria which will be used to determine
frequency (e.g, significant changes in facility personnel), especially if inspections
are not typically conducted annually.<p>

<p>

<b>    Question #3</b>: Freedom of Information (FOI) system - Why is it currently taking
so long to get reports? Is there adequate staff?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #3</b>: Dr. Dull did not have a solution to this problem, although he did
indicate that there is adequate staff in the Department. If reports are not received
within the expected time frame, follow up should be done through the FOI officer.<p>

<p>

<b>    Question #4</b>: Does EPA expect the GLP Compliance Statement to include
measurements which are recorded as "visual observations" (e.g., cloud cover, %
slope, soil moisture)?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #4</b>: These are not compliance issues, but are protocol issues. EPA
would not expect to see them on the Compliance Statement, especially if it is noted
in the protocol that they will be visual observations.<p>

<p>

    <b>Question #5</b>: Is it acceptable for the study director's management to sign the
protocol "for" (instead of) the study director?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #5</b>: Signature by someone other than the study director would imply to
EPA that the study director does not have overall responsibility, so this is
unacceptable.<p>

<p>

<b>    Question #6: </b>EPA is currently utilizing a "holistic" approach to inspections.
This method involves inspecting one phase of the study at a time including
sponsor's facility, project management firm, field site, processing facility, and lab. 
The inspection notification letter has not been modified. Some parts of the standard
letter are not applicable to each site, which may lead to confusion and excess EPA
time spent explaining the procedure. Will EPA continue to use this inspection
method? If so, will the letter be modified?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #6</b>: This inspection method has been used in the past, but did not
include inspection of facilities that were strictly project management for the
studies. There are advantages (e.g, thorough knowledge of study by inspectors) and
disadvantages (e. g., cost) to this procedure. Dean Hill (NEIC) will be discussing
the method at the OECD Inspectors Training Course to be held in June. After the
current inspections are completed, EPA will assess whether this is the best
approach.  If this method is used in the future, EPA will consider modification of
the notification letter.<p>

<p>

<b>    Question #7:</b> What is the current status of the EPA reorganization and NEIC
reporting lines?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #7:</b> The reorganization package is out of the preliminary stages of
review and there are apparently no significant problems or nonconcurrences.  It
will now go to the EPA Administrator for review and then go to the union.  EPA
does not expect any further issues to materialize.  After the reorganization, the
NEIC Pesticides/Toxic Substances Branch will report to the Director of the
Agriculture and Ecosystems Division in Washington DC.  Dr Dull indicated that
the package is still on track for finalization by the 1st of June.<p>

<p>

    <b>Question #8</b>: Are there any new enforcement actions pending?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #8</b>: The EPA still hopes to have an enforcement case initiative (possibly
15-20 cases) in this fiscal year.<p>

<p>

<b>    Question #9</b>: Should copies of QA inspection/audit reports be stamped exact
copy?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #9:</b> As long as the original exists, the photocopy does not have to be
stamped. If the copy is intended to replace the original, then it should be stamped.<p>

<p>

     <b>Question #10</b>: For field studies, what records of pre-study transplant
maintenance need to be kept?<p>

<p>

<b>    Answer #10</b>: The same records must be kept as if seeds had been planted (e.g.,
history, maintenance, and cultural practices). The protocol should cover what
documentation it is necessary to maintain.<p>

<p>

<b>    Question #11</b>: Are maintenance staff considered study personnel (e.g.,
weeders)?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #11</b>: Personnel performing maintenance types of duties such as weeding
and irrigating would probably not be considered part of the study conduct.
Typically study personnel includes application and sampling personnel. Also, the
person who receives the test substance or samples would probably not be
considered part of the study conduct. It was noted that although these people may
not be considered part of the study conduct, it would not hurt to list their names as
study personnel.<p>

<p>

<b>    Question #12</b>: Should protocol deviations be written for SOP deviations?<p>

<p>

<b>    Answer #12</b>: No, as long as the deviation is documented and maintained with
the raw data, it need only be written in one place<p>

<p>

    <b>Question #13</b>: How should a mistake in an issued protocol
amendment/deviation be corrected?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #13</b>: An amendment should be written to make a change in a previous
amendment because the first amendment has become part of the protocol. A
deviation does not technically become part of the protocol because it is something
in the protocol that was not followed.  For this reason, a deviation can be corrected
by a note in the raw data file.<p>

<p>

    <b>Question #14</b>: What does EPA consider to be the minimum for a permanent plot
marker?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #14</b>: The response reinforced the fact that EPA does indeed have a
sense of humor. Dr. Dull indicated that the best permanent marker is a granite
stone sunk at least 10 feet in the ground. He also stated however, that the EPA
cannot dictate what equipment to use and that judgment should be exercised
regarding the best permanent marker available.<p>

<p>

    <b>Question #15</b>: Is there currently any budget for travel for GLP inspections?<p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #15</b>:  EPA will not have any travel funds until reorganization takes
place and new budget money is designated.  Currently the only inspections being
conducted are the ones that were previously approved. This includes the remaining
portions of the "holistic" inspections that Dean Hill (NEIC) is conducting.<p>

 <b><i>FDA Liaison Report</i></b><p>

<p>

   Mr Stan Woollen Replaces Dr. Paul Lepore as FDA's Bioresearch Monitoring
Coordinator.<p>

<p>

   As many of us are already aware, Mr. Stan Woollen replaced Dr. Paul Lepore as
FDA's Bioresearch Monitoring Coordinator in October 1994. Mr. Woollen, a
graduate of the University of Florida, has gained extensive Bioresearch Monitoring
(BM) experience in the areas of drugs, biologics, and devices since joining FDA's
Washington, DC Field Office in Virginia in 1977. He expresses a relentless
enthusiasm for his job. Throughout his career with FDA, Mr. Woollen has
conducted numerous inspections of Clinical Investigators and Sponsor Monitors
both in the US and internationally. As an FDA Investigator, he served as a District
BM Specialist for the Baltimore District, and in 1988 was selected as a Regional
BM Specialist for the Mid Atlantic Region. In 1991, he was selected as
Supervisory Investigator in charge of the Washington, DC Field Office, and later
transferred to FDA Headquarters as the Associate BM Program Coordinator,
working with Dr. Lepore.<p>

<p>

   Mr. Woollen is pleased with what he's learned about SQA since his attendance at
the October 1994 National Meeting. He senses a QA and regulator kinship--a
common perspective that we share, aspiring to uncompromised research data
quality and integrity. Mr. Woollen also indicated that as a result of his experience
as a field investigator at FDA, he believes that the most valuable information
comes from the individuals on the operations end (i.e., in industry). He looks
forward to feedback from SQA.<p>

<p>

    Computer Systems Validation --   At the request of SQA's Regulatory Review
Committee, Mr. Woollen was queried on the subject of Computer Systems
Validation.<p>

<p>

   <b>Question #1</b>: Which of the following reference documents best represents FDA's
opinion on how to properly validate computer systems used for toxicology
laboratories?<p>

<p>


<ul>
  <li>Guide to Inspection of Computerized Data Systems in Drug Processing
(February 1983).  </li>
  <li>Technical Reference on Software Development Activities (July 1987).</li>
  <li>Computerized Data Systems for Nonclinical Safety Assessments--Current
Concepts and Quality Assurance (DLA "Red Apple Guide," 1988)</li>
</ul>
<p>

   <b>Answer #1</b>: According to Mr. Woollen, each of the referenced documents
articulates sound principles of software systems development. He believes,
however, that the second document, "Technical Reference on Software
Development Activities," is probably the most widely used by FDA Investigators
and has the broadest application. He also pointed out that, of the three documents,
the Red Apple Guide is not a government publication and thus is not referenced in
the current version of the GLP Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM
7348.808). Mr. Woollen further noted that none of the three documents serve as
official guidance documents on FDA validation requirements.<p>

<p>

<b>   Question #2</b>: Is the user required to possess the source code for vendor supplied
software?<p>

<p>

   <b>Answer #2:</b> Not necessarily. The user is required to have access to the source
code for vendor supplied software. Review of the software is an essential element
in the validation of the software or verification of the adequacy of the software
validation. The software user is ultimately responsible for performing one or the
other of these functions. It is possible for a user to have access to the source code
without actually possessing it. For example, the vendor may permit the user to
review source code at the vendor's site or make other arrangements where the
vendor retains possession of the source code but provides access to the user.  
Validation data, including source code, falls within the scope of FDA's inspection
authority under 21 CFR 58.15. Consequently, if the user elects not to retain source
code in their possession they should be prepared to obtain access to the source code
during an FDA audit. As a general rule, source code should be accessible for
inspection at the users site within a reasonable time. The user should also possess,
on site, documentation that they either validated the software themselves or
verified the adequacy of vendor validation of software.<p>

<p>

   <b>Question #3:</b> Must vendor supplied software be validated in a "line-by-line"
verification of source code fashion?<p>

<p>

<b>   Answer #3</b>: Yes, source code does need to be examined and evaluated on a
line-by-line basis during the validation process. The question is, who should do
this? If a vendor supplies software which claims to have been validated, then the
recipient (user) of the software does not necessarily have to perform a
"line-by-line" validation of the vendor supplied software. The user does, however,
have to verify that the vendor's validation is adequate and that the supplied
software is of appropriate design to function according to user specifications. This
will require that the user review the vendor's software validation documentation.
The user should verify that the vendor has done a line-by-line source code
validation during the development of each module.<p>

<h3> REGULATORY REVIEW</h3>
</center>
<p>

<b><i> FDA Liaison Report</i></b><p>

<p>

   Discussion with Stan Woollen, FDA Bioresearch Monitoring Coordinator. At the
request of SQA's Regulatory Review Committee, the following questions were
submitted to Mr. Woollen for discussion.<p>

<p>

    <b>Question #1</b>: Will the new regulations on electronic signatures (45160 FR Vol.
59 No. 168 / Wednesday, August 31, 1994 / Electronic Signatures; Electronic
Records; Proposed Rule) make it possible for us to have electronic signatures on
GLP protocols, amendments and final reports? <p>

<p>

    <b>Answer #1</b>: Based on the interpretation of the proposed rule, the question is easy
to answer - yes, the proposed rule covers Part 58. In fact, the scope of the proposed
regulation includes all of Title 21, Chapter 1, that is, all FDA regulations. Records
may be retained electronically providing they are 21 CFR 11 compliant. 
Publication of the Electronic Signatures/Records Final Rule is expected by Fall
1995. <p>

<p>

   <b>Question #2</b>: The current version of CPGM 7348.808 instructs the FDA
investigator to "Verify that the final report contains...a description of any computer
program changes." What level of change is expected to be described in final
reports, for example, a whole system, or new module, or every time we make a
minor modification?<p>

<p>

     <b>Answer #2:</b> From a regulatory perspective the final report must have a
description of methods used to conduct the study and it must address any
circumstances that may have affected the data integrity or quality. The introduction
of major new systems, or significant changes to existing systems, especially during
the course of a study, should be addressed in the final report. <p>

<p>

   <b>Question #3</b>: FDA regulations do not require backup copies of electronic
records, but the current version of CPGM 7348.808 instructs FDA investigators to
determine "how and where the original computer data and backup copies are
stored." Is this to suggest that backup copies must be maintained?<p>

<p>

<b>    Answer #3</b>: It is true the regulations generally do not require that backup copies
be stored. However, if it is a facility's standard operating procedure to retain
backup copies, for example, to protect against potential data loss or corruption,
then the conditions of storage are expected to be appropriate to minimize
deterioration of the electronic records. Thus it may be incumbent upon the FDA
investigator to evaluate the location and conditions of storage of original computer
data and backups to assure they are consistent with the nature of the records. <p>

Preamble to FDA GLPs (contd.)<p>

<hr>
<p>
<br>
<a href="./prefda1.html#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<a name="SOPs"><b>Standard Operating Procedures</b></a><p> 
<p>

 29. Two comments on the requirements for standard operating procedures suggested that
Section 58.81(a) be amended to permit appropriate supervisory personnel to authorize deviations
from the written standard operating procedures, arguing that the study director may not have the
technical expertise to evaluate such deviations. One of the comments further argued for the
change on the ground that the principles of good laboratory practice established by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development of the World Health Organization do
not require study director approval of all standard operating procedure deviations.<p>

<p>

 FDA does not accept the suggestion.  As discussed in paragraph 9 of this preamble, it is not
necessary for the study director to be technically competent in all aspects of a study to assure
that
appropriate action is taken in response to any circumstances that may affect the quality and
integrity of a study. The study director, however, has to be aware of and authorize any deviations
that could have an impact on the study. FDA does not agree that the responsibility of the study
director, as set forth in Section 58.81(a), is inconsistent with the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development principles of GLP. Chapter 2, section 2.3 (Ref. 1, p. 27) of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development document defines the responsibilities
of the study director, in part, as"ensur[ing] that the procedures specified in the study plan are
followed, and that authorization for any modification is obtained and documented together with
the reasons for them ..." Accordingly, both the GLP regulations and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development principles of GLP require that the study director make
certain that specified procedures are followed and that all modifications to the procedures in the
approved study plan (i.e., standard operating procedures) are documented and approved. <p>

 30. One comment recommended that FDA amend Section 58.81(b) to delete all examples of
standard operating procedures that FDA requires a testing facility to establish on the ground that
'the list is not all-inclusive and may lead to misinterpretation.
<p>

 FDA disagrees with the recommendation. The examples listed in Section 58.81(b) are those
minimal laboratory procedures which the agency believes are essential to assuring the quality
and
integrity of the data generated in the course of any study (see 41 FR 51213). FDA recognizes
that
circumstances may necessitate establishment of additional standard operating procedures. The
list
is not intended to be all-inclusive and should not be interpreted as such.<p>

 31. Three comments objected to the proposed deletion of examples of laboratory manuals and
standard operating procedures required to be in the laboratory under Section 58.81(c). The
comments argued that the listing of examples serves to spell out the agency's intent, helps
laboratories decide which areas to cover, and that without such guidance a potential exists for
misinterpretation of FDA's intent. <p>

 FDA does not agree.  Section 58.81(c) requires that each laboratory area have immediately
available standard operating procedures relative to the Iaboratory procedures being performed. 
Unlike the list in Section 58.81(b), which represents specific minimal requirements, the
examples
listed in Section 58.81(c) encompass very broad areas.  Each of the areas presented would
require
the preparation of a group of standard operating procedures to cover adequately the operations
within that area. Consequently, the agency concluded that the list in Section 58.81(c) is too
broad
to serve as useful guidance.<p>

<br>
<a href="./prefda1.html#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<a name="Reagents and Solutions"><b>Reagents and Solutions</b></a> <p>

 32.   FDA received five comments that recommended that the agency amend Section 58.83. 
Four comments stated that only those reagents and solutions used in the conduct of nonclinical
laboratory studies need to be labeled in accord with the requirements of Section 58.83, i.e., "to
indicate identity, titer or concentration, storage requirements, and expiration date" of the
material. 
These comments argued that such a modification would allow the laboratory flexibility in
designing the most suitable system to assure that deteriorated or outdated reagents and solutions
are not used. The fifth comment recommended that FDA insert into the first sentence of Section
58.83 the phrase "as appropriate" to make the provision read "all reagents and solutions in the
laboratory areas shall be labeled to indicate identity, titer or concentration, storage requirements
and, as appropriate, expiration date."  This comment argued that it was not necessary to have
expiration dates on certain stable reagents and solutions such as water and saline.<p>


FDA declines to amend Section 58.83.  The agency continues to believe, as discussed in
paragraph 148 of the preamble to the final rule (43 FR 60003), that all reagents and solutions
maintained in the laboratory area for use in the conduct of nonclinical laboratory studies should
be
labeled as required by Section 58.83.   Accordingly, the label should include the identity, titer or
concentration, storage requirements, and expiration date. This label information is the minimum
information necessary to make clear to the laboratory personnel that the reagents and solutions
are suitable for use in the procedures specified in the protocol and to protect against inadvertent
mixups of reagents and solutions that are used in nonclinical laboratory studies with those that
are
not intended for such use.<p>


Further, FDA disagrees with the comment that suggested that expiration dating is not necessary
for some reagents and solutions.  FDA believes that expiration dates should be required on all
reagents and solutions without regard to their stability so that there is no doubt about the
suitability of the material for use in nonclinical laboratory studies. <p>
<br>
<a href="./prefda1.html#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<a name="Animal Care"><b>Animal Care</b></a><p>

<p>

 33.  One comment recommended  that FDA delete Section 58.90(a) on the basis that requiring
standard operating procedures for housing, feeding, handling, and care of animals is redundant to
other provisions of the GLP regulations. <p>

 FDA recognizes that Section 58.81(b)(2) requires testing facilities to establish standard
operating
procedures for animal care.  Section 58.90(a), however, expressly specifies that standard
operating procedures shall also cover animal housing, feeding, and handling. The agency
believes
that these items are essential features for providing adequate humane treatment of animals and,
therefore, is retaining Section 58.90(a). <p>

 34. Two comments objected to the proposed amendment of the requirements under Sections
58.90 (b) and (c) to provide that animals may be isolated rather than quarantined. The comments
argued that allowing laboratories to develop isolation and health status evaluation procedures in
lieu of quarantine may not provide adequate assurance of test animal health because such
evaluations are done only on a small randomly selected number of animals and are not as reliable
as an adequate quarantine period.  One comment suggested that the term "segregated" or the
term
"separated" may more accurately reflect FDA's intent in amending Sections 58.90(b) and (c) than
does the term "isolated."<p>

 As discussed in the preamble to the proposed amendments (49 FR 43533),  substitution of a
requirement for isolation and health status evaluations in lieu of quarantine of newly received
animals will permit laboratories to develop specific isolation and health status evaluation
procedures in concert with the age, species, and class of animals and with the type of study to be
done. As used in current Section 58.90(b), the term "quarantine" connotes a rigid set of prestudy
procedures which a facility is obligated to follow, including a mandatory holding period,
specified
diagnostic procedures, and the use of specialized facilities and animal care practices.  The
agency
has concluded that isolation and health status evaluations should provide adequate precautions
against entry of unhealthy animals into a study. Health status evaluations may be performed
during the prestudy acclimation period. Under Section 58.90(b), the health status of each animal
is to be evaluated soon after receipt. Section 58.90(c) prohibits the entry of any diseased animal
into the study. <p>

 The agency has also concluded that a devoted area equipped to provide isolation of diseased
animals is not necessary in all cases. As discussed in the preamble to the proposal (49 FR
43533),
FDA believes that it should allow certain options for handling diseased animals, thereby
permitting increased flexibility in laboratory operation. FDA agrees that the term "segregate" or
the term "separate" rather than the term "isolate" could be used in as much as each term connotes
"to set apart."  Because "isolate" is a term commonly used and understood in contemporary
veterinary medical practice, however, FDA will continue to use that term in these regulations. 
<p>

35.  One comment recommended that FDA amend Section 58.90(d) to permit procedural means
to provide "appropriate identification" of individual animals in a study.<p>

 FDA does not accept the recommendation.  The agency notes that proper animal identification
throughout a study is essential to study integrity.  When animals are housed individually in
cages,
procedural means can be used to identify each individual animal, i.e., a cage card may be used if
it
provides all the information necessary to identify the animal specificaIIy, and the animal
handling
standard operating procedures specify detailed procedures for preventing animal mixups.  The
agency is not aware, however, of any procedural means that could be used to identify adequately
individual animals that are housed within a group in a cage. FDA advises that Section 58.90(d)
does not preclude identification by means other than the examples enumerated in that section
provided that individual identification can be maintained and documented throughout a
study.<p>

<br>
<a href="./prefda1.html#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<a name="Test"><b>Test and Control Article Characterization</b></a> <p>

 36.  One comment urged the agency to delete the requirement in Section 58.105(b) for stability
determination of test and control articles before initiation of the study.  The comment argued that
changing Section 58.105(b) as recommended would make it consistent with FDA's proposed
changes to Section 58.105(a), which would allow test and control article characterization after
completion of the study. <p>

   FDA disagrees with the recommendation. As discussed in the preamble to the proposal (49 FR
43533), FDA has concluded that characterization of test and control articles need not be
performed until initial toxicology studies with the test article show reasonable promise of the
article's reaching the marketplace.  In arriving at this conclusion, the agency considered that
prior
knowledge of the precise molecular structure of a test article is not vital to the conduct of a valid
toxicology test. It is important, however, to know the strength, purity, and stability of a test or
control article that is used in a nonclinical laboratory study.<p>

 A stability determination of a test or control article conducted after completion of the
nonclinical
laboratory test with the article does not provide any information about the continued strength of
either the test or control article previously given to the test system. Determining that the test and
control articles are stable for the duration of the study is fundamental to interpreting the results
of
the study. For this reason, it would be inappropriate to allow for stability determinations only
after-the-fact.  <p>

 The agency does believe, however, that the continued strength of the test or control article may
adequately be determined either by stability testing before initiation of the study or through
appropriate periodic analysis of each batch. Section 58.105(b) currently allows stability testing
of
the test and control articles through periodic analysis only if it is not possible to determine their
stability before study initiation.  Because experience has shown that it is adequate either to
determine stability of the test and control articles before initiation of a study or by periodic
analysis of the articles while the study is in progress,  the agency on its own initiative is revising
Section 58.105(b) to provide facilities and sponsors the flexibility to use either approach. 
Therefore,  Section 58.105(b) has been revised to provide for determination of the stability of the
test or control article either before study initiation or through periodic analysis of each batch
according to established standard operating procedures. <p>

 37. One comment observed that Section 58.105(a) provides that testing facilities may rely on the
labeling of marketed products for purposes of characterizing such products used as control
articles in a study. The comment recommended that the agency also revise Section 58.105(b) to
allow product labeling to serve as documentation of stability for marketed products used as
control articles.<p>

 FDA declines to adopt this recommendation. The only stability information typically included
on
the labeling of marketed products is the expiration date. The manufacturer's expiration dating on
a
marketed product is not adequately precise to provide data on the strength of the control article
used throughout a nonclinical laboratory study. Lacking precise stability information respecting
the control article could raise doubts concerning whether the test and control articles are
comparable. Furthermore, mixing the marketed product with a carrier or use of the product in a
manner not in accord with its labeling could alter the stability characteristics of the product. For
these reasons, FDA  concludes that determination of the stability in accordance with the
procedures in Section 58.105(b) still is appropriate for any products used as control articles. <p>

 38.  Several comments recommended that FDA revise Section 58.105(c) to remove the current
requirement that storage containers be assigned to a test article for the duration of a nonclinical
laboratory study. The comments argued that the requirement is unnecessary and is inconsistent
with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development principles of GLP. One
comment alleged that the statement is vague and questioned whether the provision would permit
a
storage container that a laboratory emptied during the conduct of, but before completion of a
study to be destroyed or reused. The same comment also questioned whether, as the test article is
depleted during the conduct of a study,  the provision would permit a laboratory to transfer the
test article into a container smaller than that originally assigned to the article. <p>

 FDA does not believe that it would be appropriate to eliminate the storage container provision in
Section 58.105(c).  FDA advises that the provision simply requires that each test article storage
container be assigned to a test article at the beginning of a study and remain so assigned until the
study is completed, terminated, or discontinued. The test article may not be transferred to
different sized storage containers as a study progresses, nor may assigned storage containers be
destroyed while a study is in progress.<p>


 The agency recognizes that it may be inconvenient for laboratories, especially small
laboratories,
to devote space to a test article container which is emptied before a study is completely
terminated, or discontinued, or which might be replaced by progressively smaller containers
while
a study is in progress. Destroying or reusing or otherwise substituting for originally assigned,
identified test article storage containers however, could adversely affect the integrity of the
study. 
FDA established the current provision because the agency observed a lack of accountability for
test materials, ostensibly due to the very acts proscribed by the regulation, i.e., transfer of test
articles to different sized containers and destruction of empty containers during the progress of
nonclinical laboratory studies.<p>

FDA continues to believe that the requirement concerning assignment of storage containers is
necessary to ensure the integrity of a study.  For example, the mere act of transferring a test
article from one storage container to another introduces the opportunity for contamination of the
test article by other laboratory materials or for mixups with other laboratory materials. In
addition, during a transfer the test article would be exposed to air-borne contaminants as well as
to moisture, either of which may compromise the integrity of the test article.<p>

 FDA also believes that requiring that containers be assigned to a test article for the duration of a
study is fully consistent with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
principles of GLP.  Chapter 2, section 2.3 (Ref. 1, p. 31) of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development document states that "storage container(s) should carry
identification information, earliest expiration date, and specific storage instructions." Although
the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development document does not further
characterize storage instructions that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development would recommend be included on containers, FDA concludes that its regulation
identifies a "specific" storage instruction that is necessary to assure the integrity of the test
article.

<b><a name="Mixtures">Mixtures </a>of Articles with Carriers</b> <p>

39. Two comments argued that  requirements in Section 58.113(a) to determine the uniformity,
concentration, and stability of test and control articles in mixtures is unnecessarily burdensome
for
short-term studies. One comment stated that such tests are not necessary for test articles that are
prepared and dispensed on the same day as used in single-dose acute toxicity tests. The
comments
suggested that the agency revise Section 58.113(a) to require that tests of mixtures of test and
control articles need be conducted only "for studies other than short-term." <p>

 Section 58.113(a) requires, for all test or control articles mixed with a carrier, a determination of
the uniformity of the mixture and a periodic analysis of the concentration of the test or control
article in the mixture.  In addition, Section  58.113(a)(2), as amended, requires a determination
of
the stability of the test or control article in the mixture adequate to support time of use. Each of
these analyses is necessary to assure that the test system is exposed to the test or to the control
article in the amounts specifically designated in the protocol for a study.  Determination of the
uniformity of a mixture assures that each member of the test system receives the intended dose
of 
test or control article.  Periodic analysis of the concentration of the test or control article serves
as
a spot check to assure that the test or control article mixture has been prepared properly and in
accord with the protocol and with applicable standard operating procedures.  Determining the
stability of the test or control article in the mixture helps to determine the period of time during
which the test or control article mixture may be suitable for administration to the test system. 
FDA believes that knowledge of the dose of test or control article used in any test is essential for
the proper evaluation of the results of that test.  For these reasons, FDA has concluded that the
requirements of Section 58.113(a) should continue to apply to short-term tests as well as to
studies other than short term.<p>

 As discussed in paragraph 36 of this preamble, however, FDA has decided to allow facilities
and
sponsors the flexibility to determine the stability of test and control articles either before study
initiation or through periodic analysis of each batch according to established standard operating
procedures.   The agency believes that it is appropriate to allow similar flexibility with respect to
determining the stability of mixtures of articles with carriers.  For this reason, on its own
initiative,
FDA has revised Section 58.113(a)(2) to allow determination of the stability of test and control
articles in the mixture either before study initiation or through periodic analysis of the mixture
according to established standard operating procedures. <p>

 40. One comment recommended that FDA delete Section 58.113(a)(1), alleging that periodic
determinations of the test or control article in mixtures is routine and provisions respecting such
determinations would more appropriately be included in Section 58.35(b)(3).<p>

 The comment misconstrues the function of the QAU (see especially paragraphs 12 and 18 of
this
preamble).  Current Section 58.35(b)(3), as well as Section 58.35(b)(3) as revised by this final
rule assigns responsibility for periodic inspection of laboratory operations to the QAU.  The
QAU
does not, indeed, under Section 58.35(a), the QAU may not conduct any portion of a study. 
Rather. it is responsible for assuring that a study is conducted according to the protocol, the
standard operating procedures, and the GLP regulations.<p>

<br>
<a href="./prefda1.html#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<a name="Protocol"><b>Protocol</b></a><p>

 41.  A comment urged the agency to delete the provision in current Section 58.120(a)(10)  (final
Section 58.120(a)(10)) that requires that the protocol for each study identify the records for the
study to be maintained. The comment argued that the requirement in renumbered Section
58.120(a)(10) is redundant to the same requirements in Sections 58.33(f), 58.190(a), and
58.195(b). <p>

 FDA recognizes that Sections 58.33(f), 58.190(a), and 58.195(b) address records that the GLP
regulations require a testing facility to retain in all events.  As the authorized master plan for a
study however, the protocol should identify all records of the study to be maintained by the
testing facility to inform all study participants fully of record keeping obligations.  The agency
believes that inclusion of this information in the protocol is essential to ensure adequate
documentation of the conduct of the study. <p>

 For these reasons, FDA declines to remove Section 58.120(a)(10) from the GLP regulations.
<p>

 42. One comment recommended that FDA delete the provision in current Section 58.120(a)(16)
(final Section 58.120(a)(12)) that requires that the protocol for each study include a statement of
the proposed statistical methods to be used in the study. The comment argued that a
determination of the statistical methods used to evaluate data can, in many cases, be made after
data have been reviewed. <p>

FDA recognizes that circumstances occasionally require a testing facility to modify the proposed
statistical methods for analysis of the data in a given study.  Good scientific practice, however,
requires consideration of the statistical analysis of a study as part of the design of the study to
assess whether the objectives of the study can be met.   FDA concludes that the requirement is
appropriate.<p>

<a href="./prefda1.html#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<b><a name="Conduct">Conduct</a> of a Nonclinical Laboratory Study</b> <p>

 43. Section 58.130(c) provides that materials derived from a test system for examination or
analysis (specimens) are to be identified by test system, study, nature, and the date of collection,
and requires that such identification is to be located on the specimen container or is to
accompany
the specimen in a manner that precludes error in the recording and storage of data.  Five
comments argued that the requirements under Section 58.130(c) for specimen identification are
overly restrictive and suggested that management should be responsible for determining methods
for identifying specimens.<p>

<p>

 The identification requirements specified in Section 58.130(c) are designed to preclude error
during the conduct of a nonclinical laboratory study. FDA has reviewed the requirements and
has
concluded that the identifying information specified in the regulation is the minimum
information
needed to distinguish each specimen from all others that have been collected in the facility
thereby
protecting against mixups and permitting orderly storage of specimens.  Such information also
shows whether the data collected on each specimen are assigned to the correct component of the
test system. <p>

 FDA has always provided flexibility in the methods to be used for identifying the specimens in
that the identifying information can be encoded through, for example, the use of accession
numbers affixed to the specimen with the numbers decoded in accompanying information (see,
e.g.,  paragraph 205 of the preamble to the final rule (43 FR 60008)). The agency believes that
the
requirements with respect to specimen identification are the minimum requirements necessary to
prevent mixup of specimens or lost specimen identity.<p>


 44. Two comments disagreed with FDA's proposal to revise Section  58.130(d) which currently
requires that records of gross findings for a specimen from postmortem (necropsy) observations
shall, in all cases, be provided to a pathologist during study of the specimen. The proposed
revision provides only that such records "should" be made available to the pathologist.  Four
comments supported the proposed change on the ground that the resulting flexibility allows
"blinding" of the pathologist.  One comment suggested that Section 58.130(d) be deleted in its
entirety or, alternatively, modified by specifying that the records are to be provided to the
pathologist "if required by the protocol."         <p>

 FDA established Section 58.130(d) in the belief that the provision would increase the
pathologist's ability to describe correctly microscopic findings and to relate such findings
properly
with the gross postmortem observations (41 FR 51214).  FDA continues to believe that for most
studies it is important for the pathologist to have available the records of gross findings when
examining a specimen histopathologically. The agency recognizes, however, that for certain
nonclinical laboratory studies it may be appropriate for pathologists to evaluate the
histopathological specimens without being informed of the necropsy findings. The change made
in
the regulation will permit the study director, in concert with management, to determine the need
for "blinding" in relation to the specific objectives of the study.<p>

 FDA advises that it continues to believe that for most studies it is a preferred practice not to use
"blinding" in histopathological evaluation.  For this reason, the agency is not deleting Section
58.130(d) as suggested by one comment. The alternative phrase "if required by the protocol"
suggested by the comment would serve the same purpose as the modification proposed by the
agency. Therefore, the agency is adopting Section 58.130(d) as proposed.<p>

 45. One comment on Section 58.130(e) requested that FDA clarify the meaning of the term
"automated data collection systems," stating that it is unclear whether Section 58.130(e) applies
to tabulation of source data from "hard" copy by automated systems. <p>

 As discussed in paragraph 7a. of this preamble, hand-recorded data collected during a study are
"raw data." The subsequent entry of these hand recorded data into a computer system, for
example, by data processing clerks or through the use of optical readers, does not alter the status
of the hand recorded data as "raw data."  The processing of these data by the computer, e.g.,
tabulation, is not "direct data input" and is, therefore, not encompassed by the requirements of
Section 58.130(e). <p>

<b><a name="Reporting">Reporting</a> of Nonclinical Laboratory Study Results </b> <p>

 46. Section 58.185(a) requires that a final report be prepared for each nonclinical laboratory
study conducted and specifies the minimum information that shall be included in a final report.
One comment urged that Section 58.185(a) should be modified to require final reports to include
the specified information only "where appropriate" to make the requirements respecting final
reports consistent with FDA's proposal to change Section 58.120(a) respecting protocols. 
Alternatively, the comment urged that, at the least, Section 58.185(a)(8), which requires that any
final report shall include a description of the dosage, dosage regimen, route of administration,
and
duration, should be so modified.  The comment argued that some of the information required
under this paragraph is not applicable to certain studies involving medical devices.<p>

 FDA proposed to change Section 58.120(a) in recognition of the fact that certain of the
enumerated items are not necessary for the protocols for all studies. FDA has carefully reviewed
each of the items listed in Section 58.185(a) and has concluded that the information required by
this section to be included in a final report for a nonclinical laboratory study is necessary to
evaluate any such study.  FDA notes that Section 58.185 currently allows certain appropriate
flexibilities where specified information is determined by the laboratory not to be relevant to a
study.  For example, Section 58.185(a)(4) provides that test and control articles may be
identified
by "other appropriate characteristics" and Section 58.185(a)(7) includes the term "where
applicable."  The agency believes that the information required by Section  58.185(a)(8) is
applicable to studies involving medical devices. For example, "dosage" and "dosage regimen"
for
devices may be expressed in units used per animal at a designated frequency of use. "Route of
administration" may describe the means by which the device is used in relation to the animal.
"Duration" would pertain to the period of time the device was tested in the animal. These
clarifications should permit nonclinical laboratory studies on medical devices to be reported
properly. <p>

 47. Section 58.185(a)(10) requires that each final report of a nonclinical laboratory study
include
the name of the study director, the names of other scientists or professionals, and the names of all
supervisory personnel involved in the study. One comment recommended that FDA revise
Section
58.185(a)(10) to require identification only of the study director and of the principal scientists
involved in the study.  <p>

 FDA disagrees with this suggestion.  Supervisors play an important role in the data collection
process. They supervise those who perform the procedures, may recommend or actually provide
training, and assure that data collection is carried out in accordance with the protocol, the
standard operating procedures, and the GLP regulations. The names of all scientists,
professionals, and supervisors are needed to assure the accountability of all of those individuals
responsible for the integrity of the study. The comment did not provide any data or information
to
support its recommendation to revise Section 58.185(a)(10) and the agency concludes that it
should retain the current requirement.<p>

48a. Section 58.185(a)(12) requires that the final report of a nonclinical laboratory study include
the signed and dated reports of each of the individual scientists or other professionals who were
involved in the study. Two comments recommended that FDA revise Section 58.185(a)(12) to
allow for combined reports signed by the principal scientists.  According to the comments,
allowing for such combined reports would be consistent with the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development principles of GLP.<p>

 The agency does not believe that a combined report from scientists of different disciplines
would
be appropriate. Each individual scientist involved in a study has to be accountable for reporting
data, information, and views within his or her designated area of responsibility. Reports which
combine the data, information, and views of more than one such person would obscure the
individual's accountability for accurate reporting. Furthermore, FDA believes that the comment
has misinterpreted the standard that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development established respecting reports of persons involved in a nonclinical laboratory
study.
Chapter 2, section 2.3 (Ref. 1, p. 36) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development document provides that "if reports of principal scientists from co-operating
disciplines are included in the final report, they should sign and date them."  It provides further
that the final report should contain the "names of other principal personnel having contributed
reports to the final report." These provisions do not imply that combined reports would be
appropriate. Rather, they support the need for individual accountability. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development provisions are entirely consistent with the provisions
of
section 58.185(a)(12). <p>

 48b. On its own initiative, FDA is amending Section 58.185(b) to provide that the final report
shall contain the dated signature of the study director to conform the provision to the definition
of
"study completion date" being added by this final rule (see paragraph 6 of this preamble). <p>

<b><a name="Storage">Storage </a>and Retrieval of Records and Data</b> <p>

 49. FDA proposed to revise Section 58.190(a) to allow wet specimens and specimens from
mutagenicity tests to be discarded after evaluation and recording. The agency's proposal was
supported by several comments.  One comment, however, requested that the agency clarify the
meaning of"mutagenicity tests" as the term is used in Section 58.190(a). The comment asked
whether, for example, in vitro cell transformation is interpreted to be a mutagenicity test under
this provision. <p>

 FDA advises that, for the purpose of Section 58.190(a), the agency considers mutagenicity tests
to be those tests designed to assess the capacity of a test or control article to induce heritable
changes in a test system. Accordingly, FDA considers in vitro cell transformation to be a
mutagenicity test as the term is used in the GLP regulations. <p>

 50. One comment recommended that FDA further revise Section 58.190(a) to assure that the
regulation makes clear that final reports must be retained. <p>

 As discussed at length in the preamble to the proposal (49 FR 43534), FDA intended to exclude
from the retention requirements of the GLP regulations specimens that are relatively fragile or
contribute only in a minor way to safety evaluation. FDA did not intend to change the current
requirement that final reports of any nonclinical laboratory study are to be retained in accordance
with Section 58.195. To preclude any possible confusion regarding the requirement that final
reports must be retained. FDA is rewording Section 58.190(a) to read "all raw data,
documentation, protocols, final reports, and specimens (except those specimens obtained from
mutagenicity tests and wet specimens of blood, urine, feces, and biological fluids) generated as a
result of a nonclinical laboratory study shall be retained."<p>

<p>

 51.  FDA proposed to delete from current Section 58.195(c) the listed examples of materials that
the agency believes need to be retained only so long as the quality of the preparation affords
evaluation.  One comment noted that Section 58.195(c) should be further revised to delete wet
specimens to be consistent with the proposed revisions in  58.190(a) (see -paragraph 50 of this
preamble).<p>

 FDA agrees with the comment and in this final rule is conforming Section 58.195(c) to revised
Section 58.190(a). In pertinent part, Section 58.195(c) now reads "Wet specimens except those
specimens obtained from mutagenicity tests and wet specimens of blood, urine, feces, and
biological fluids), samples of test or control articles, and specially prepared material ....".<p>

 52.  Two comments suggested that FDA should specifically provide in new  58.195(g) that
records to be retained under the GLP regulations may be retained as magnetic media.<p>

 Section 58.195(g), which is being added to Part 58 by this final rule, provides that records
respecting a nonclinical laboratory study may be retained as original records or as true copies
such
as photocopies, microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions of the original records. 
Magnetic media could qualify as either "original records" or "accurate reproductions of the
original record."  This conclusion is consistent with Section 58.3(k), which includes "magnetic
media" within the meaning of "raw data."  Consequently, the agency does not believe that it is
necessary to change new Section 58.195(g) in order to achieve the result desired by the
comments.  <p>

Economic Assessment  <p>


 As announced in the proposal, FDA has examined the economic consequences of this final rule
in
accordance with Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L 96-354).  At
that time, the agency concluded that the changes would not constitute a major rule as defined in
the Order and that no regulatory flexibility analysis would be required. The agency also certified
that the revisions would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
The agency has not received any new information or comments that would alter its previous
determination. <p>

Environmental Impact<p>

 The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(10) that this action is of a type that does not
individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore,
neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.<p>

Dear SQA Members:<P>
         
This is a new publication whose purpose is to rapidly communicate items of regulatory
interest from the Society of Quality Assurance to its members. It will be generated by the
Regulatory Review Committee and published, on an as needed basis, as rapidly as possible.<P>
         
         The contents of the Regulatory Review Bulletin will typically report on a single issue
which is of general and immediate interest to Society members.<P>
         
         This first issue is a report of the important meeting of the Regulatory Review Committee
with members of the EPA Office of Compliance Monitoring on Monday July 9, 1990 at EPA
Headquarters (Waterside Mall) in Washington, DC. The meeting established a process for more
formal contact between SQA and EPA representatives for the dual purposes of identifying
universal goals improving data quality and integrity and promoting a better understanding of
GLP compliance issues. This non-adversarial forum will make it possible to discuss issues of
mutual concern and to clarify interpretations of compliance.<P>
         
         Harry L. Hyndman<BR>
         Chairman<P>

EPA was represented by David L. Dull, Kenneth Kanagalingam, and Francisa Liem of
EPA- OCM/LDIAD and John Neylan, Phyllis Flaherty, and Stephen Howie of EPA-OCM/Policy
& Grants. SQA was represented by Deena Clapman of Mobil Oil Corporation, Harry Hyndman
of Monsanto Agricultural Co., Nona Karten of Microbiological Associates, Inc., Doris Mason of
Rhone-Poulenc Ag. Co., Ramona Mayer of Battelle, Richard Parsons of Rohm & Haas, Elisse
Rosen of Pfizer Inc., Patricia Royal of Springborn Laboratories, and Frederick Snyder of
Hazleton Corporation.<P>
         
         The following issues were presented and discussed.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><A NAME= rrb1-1">Question #1: MECHANISM FOR DISSEMINATION OF
EPA POLICY. </B></I></A><P>

During this past year there has been confusion on the part of the regulated industry over the EPA
interpretation of recently amended GLPs. While some members of industry have submitted
specific questions to the Agency, and the Agency has responded, many times members of
industry are unaware of these questions and responses. The NACA meeting of January 8, 1990 is
a case in point. NACA attendees and members received copies of specific inquires and EPA's
responses to those questions.<P>
         However, other members of the industrial community need to be aware of EPA responses.
In the past, EPA has issued formal PR Notices to those affected by EPA policy. Has the agency
considered using the PR Notice format or another formal document to inform the regulated
community of its policy decisions? Developing such a policy by the Agency would ensure that
all affected parties were informed of the most recent EPA interpretation on compliance
issues.<P>

<B><I>Answer #1:</I></B> John Neylan indicated that the PR Notice format would not be an
appropriate means
since it is distributed only to pesticide registrants and the great majority of contract laboratories
would thus not be included. Phyllis Flaherty mentioned that a "Policy Compendium" contains
this type of information (in a Q&A format, it is believed). None of the SQA members were
familiar with that document. She also mentioned that a "Q&A Document" was being developed
by Steve Howie for dissemination of specific policy interpretations. The first edition was to be
published in about six months and all the major organizations such as ACS, AOAC, SQA, the
TSCA Hotline, etc., would be on the mailing list. Phyllis Flaherty agreed to issue a more limited
edition earlier rather than wait to include answers to all the questions currently received. David
Dull indicated that he would have it sent to all "active labs."<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><A NAME= rrb1-2">         
         Question #2: RECORD RETENTION REQUIREMENTS.</A></B></I> Record retention
requirements
as stated in the GLP regulations and those recently published by the National Archives (Federal
Register, January 26, 1990) as well as those contained within the FIFRA and TSCA statues seem
to be in conflict.<P>
         
         a) Current TSCA GLPs designate record retention periods of 10 years and 5 years in
Section 792.195(b)(1-3). It was stated in the PROPOSED TSCA rule (FR, Vol. 52, No. 2,
12/28/87, item 321) that "the Agency sees no reason to vary record retention requirements and
has concluded that a record retention period of S years from the date the study is submitted to
EPA is a sufficient period of time to meet the Agency concerns and goals".<P>
         In addition, the Agency indicated the proposed 5 year time frame was preferable "because
it is consistent with the requirement currently set forth in the FIFRA GLPs and the FDA GLP
regulations."<P>
         However, the FINAL TSCA Rule [FR, VOL. 54, No. 158, (8/17/89) Section 792.195(b)]
was not amended, nor did the preamble make mention as to why the Agency did not follow
through with their original intent. Can the EPA elaborate on why TSCA 791.195(b) was not
amended as originally intended or whether it may have been an oversight when the final TSCA
rule was issued?<P>
         
         b) Likewise, as part of the FIFRA '88 re-registration process, statements attesting to the
availability of raw data were required for studies, many of which were conducted before the
GLPs were promulgated. What position is the EPA currently taking on records
retention?<P>
         
<B><I>Answer #2:</I></B> The EPA personnel were not familiar with the requirements as
published
by
the National Archives in the Federal Register on January 26, 1990. They indicated that
requirements in the GLP Standard should generally be used as the governing factor in
determining the length of retention of records. It was noted that the FIFRA statute also directs
record retention requirements to pesticide producers (implying registrants and/or study sponsors,
generally; not contract labs). It was concluded that, in a practical sense, records will be retained
for the longest required period of time.<P>
         
         No specific reason was given as to why the TSCA GLP Standard 792.195(b) was not made
consistent with the FIFRA and FDA GLP Standards.  Phyllis Flaherty stated that any change at
this point in time would involve proposed rulemaking and would probably not be pursued.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><A NAME= rrb1-3">Question #3: INSPECTOR TRAINING PROGRAM. </A>
</B></I>The
newly amended EPA FIFRA coupled with the evolving interpretation of GLP compliance have
left experienced QAU personnel needing to rely on "best judgment" and "past experience," in
many cases, when developing and carrying out GLP programs, especially for field studies.
Complicating this problem is the assertion of inconsistencies in the application of audit policies
by field staff and
concerns about training programs for inspectors. While the recent (April 16-20, 1990) training
program in Tifton, Georgia, was a great success, especially because EPA invited members of the
SQA to participate, are other programs planned and, if so, will members of industry again be
invited to attend? <P>

<B><I>Answer #3:</I></B> David Dull indicated that he would like to have a training session
like the one
held in April, 1990 at Tifton, GA, each year but that funding for travel would be a major
consideration. He indicated that he intends to continue to invite selected members of industry to
attend these training sessions when they are held. He is hoping  to hold a training session again
in 1991. He reiterated that training of inspectors is an area of  concern for his office and that any
inconsistencies  in application of the GLP regulations by inspectors should be brought to his
attention.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><A NAME= rrb1-4">
     Question #4: INSPECTION MANUALS. </A></B></I>  There s also a need for additional
inspection
manuals, similar to those developed for health effects studies (8/85), and the draft EPA policy
documents on analytical chemistry and aquatic toxicology. Has the EPA considered developing
similar manuals for field studies? Would the EPA consider having a task group made up of
appointed SQA members and Agency officials to develop such manuals?  
<P>                   

<B><I>Answer #4:</I></B> David Dull indicated that he has formed a workgroup to develop
inspection
manuals. Diane Bradway of NEIC, Denver, is taking the lead on this project. Manuals for crop
field trial studies, field rotational crop studies, terrestrial soil dissipation studies, ecotoxicology
studies, and facilities inspections are included.   He indicated that he has valued SQA input but
that, rather than form a Task Group which includes SQA members to develop the manuals, he
will solicit our comments on the drafts when they are ready.   <P>                   
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><A NAME= rrb1-5">
     Question #5: REPORT OF INSPECTION FINDINGS.</A> </B></I> One of the needs of
QA
professionals is to clearly understand the EPA point of view on specific compliance issues.
While these are often discussed during exit interviews as part of the GLP inspection process, this
is an inappropriate time to debate EPA interpretive policy.   Compliance issues need to be
established before the inspection to promote uniformity in application. By leaving the issues
undecided until the inspection, the process is open to a degree of subjectivity on the part of the
inspector as well as the QAU and management of the facility being  inspected. This leaves an
opening for misinterpretation on the part of personnel of the facility inspected and the EPA
official. FDA has opted to use the FD 483 form to clearly state the findings and interpretation of
compliance with FDA GLPs. EPA has elected not to follow suit.  In light of penalty policies
being considered by  EPA at this time, it is important for industry to  have a documented
interpretation of compliance at the time of the exit interview. Would the agency reconsider this
request at this time?  <P>               
    
<B><I>Answer #5:</I></B> David Dull indicated that, although the timeliness of feedback
from
inspections is important, EPA is not favoring the adoption of an FDA 483 type of form at this
time. He and Ken Kanagalingam both stated that the exit interview was the best guidance on
feedback of the inspection findings--equivalent to the 483, only verbal rather than written. For
potential enforcement action, Phyllis Flaherty indicated that only matters of compliance with the
regulations would be considered "significant."<P> 

     Regarding the issuance of inspection reports, the Agency was asked whether it was
changing its policy. David Dull responded that no change is being made in the current procedure.
The current procedure is that, if there are no significant findings for enforcement, a report will be
issued by his office. If there are significant findings, no report will be issued while the findings
are referred to case-building for possible enforcement actions. David Dull also mentioned that an
ad hoc group was being formed for the purpose of  looking into the possibility of being able to
provide a quick, early decision (within 30 days) on whether to close the case without significant
findings or to refer to case-building for possible enforcement action.<P>     
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><A NAME= rrb1-6">
     Question #6: PRODUCT PERFORMANCE DATA.</A></B></I> Would the Agency
provide an
update on the inclusion of additional types of product performance data?
<P> 

<B><I>Answer #6:</I></B> No further information was available from OCM on the proposed
revisions
to
requirements for (and submission of) product performance data. The Agency indicated, however,
that any product performance data requested by data call-in under FIFRA Section 3(c)(2)(b) is
subject to GLP compliance.  <P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><A NAME= rrb1-7">
                    Question #7: TSCA SECTION 5 AND GLP STANDARD (792.12).</A> </B></I>
TSCA GLPs
(Section  792.12) require a compliance statement from "any person who submits a test required
by testing consent agreement or a test rule issued under Section 4 of TSCA." Why did the EPA
choose to exclude the requirement for a compliance statement for work done to support PMN
submissions under Section 5 of TSCA?    <P>             

<B><I>Answer #7:</I></B> David Dull indicated that data collected under TSCA Section 5
was
generally
too varied in type and source to be regulated effectively in a prospective sense. However, any
data collected under TSCA Section 5 which is submitted  to EPA must be GLP compliant or the
restrictions imposed under TSCA Sections 5(e) and 5(f) may not be lifted. <P>                     
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I><A NAME= rrb1-8">
     Question #8: SAMPLE RETENTION. </A> </B></I> There is still some confusion over
specimen
retention in non-toxicological studies (FR, Vol. 54, No. 158, 8/17/89, p. 34043, comment ii); in
particular, tissues from animals used in residue and metabolism studies. Since viability of these
specimens is determined by obtaining frozen storage stability data for the parent compound and
metabolites, tissues stored beyond the limits of frozen stability data cannot be used for obtaining
reliable results.  Could you please address this issue?  <P>                   

<B><I>Answer #8:</I></B> The retention of animal tissues  under 40 CFR 160.195(c) was
discussed
but
no further information was provided regarding the omission of animal tissues from
meat/milk/egg residue or metabolism studies from the list of samples which could be disposed
of. It was reiterated that the types of samples mentioned could be disposed of after QA
verification rather than be retained for the full period specified. All disposals must be
documented.           <P>

<b><a name="SUMMARY">SUMMARY</a></b>: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
is issuing a final rule that amends the regulations that specify good laboratory practice (GLP) for
nonclinical laboratory studies. The amendments clarify, delete, or amend several provisions of
the
GLP regulations to reduce the  regulatory burden on testing facilities. The changes will also
achieve a substantial reduction in  the paperwork burden imposed upon the regulated industries
by
the current regulations. Significant changes are made in the provisions respecting quality
assurance, protocol  preparation, test and control article characterization, and retention of
specimens and samples based on FDA's experience in implementing the regulations. The agency
has determined that  the changes will not compromise the objective of the GLP regulations.
which
is to assure the  quality and integrity of the safety data submitted in support of the approval of
regulated products. <p>

<b>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</b>:<p>

<b><a name="Background">Background</b></a><p>

<p>

 In the Federal Register of October 29, 1984 (49 FR 43530), FDA published a proposal to amend
the agency's regulations in 21 CFR Part 58, which prescribe good laboratory practice for
conducting nonclinical laboratory studies (the GLP regulations). The proposal was the result of
an
evaluation of the GLP regulations and of the data obtained by the agency's inspection program to
assess laboratory compliance with the regulations. The evaluation led the agency to conclude
that
some of the provisions of the regulations could be revised to permit nonclinical  testing
laboratories greater flexibility in conducting nonclinical laboratory studies without 
compromising
public protection. FDA invited comments on all aspects of the proposal and  provided 60 days
for
interested persons to submit comments, views, data, and information on the need to revise any
other provisions of Part 58.<p>  <p>

<b>Comments</b><p>

 FDA received 33 comments: 19 from manufacturers of articles regulated by FDA, 4 from
associations, 8 from foreign or domestic testing or consulting laboratories, and 2 from 
individuals
within FDA. The majority of these comments endorsed the proposed changes. Many of the
comments suggested additional revisions to the GLP regulations or modifications to the 
proposed
changes. A summary of the comments received by FDA during the comment period  and the
agency's response to them follows.<p>
<br>
<a href="#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<b><a name="General">General</b></a><p>

<p>

 1. One comment urged FDA to initiate training procedures for its field personnel so that the 
regulated community would obtain maximum benefit from the revisions to the GLP regulations.  
FDA agrees that agency field personnel who conduct inspections of nonclinical testing
laboratories need to understand the specific requirements of the GLP regulations to follow
appropriate inspectional practices and procedures. FDA has, to date, conducted 17 training 
courses at its National Center for Toxicological Research in Jefferson, AR, to provide training in
good laboratory practice and the associated laboratory inspection techniques. FDA intends to 
continue to provide such training for its personnel.<p>

 2. Eight comments urged FDA to encourage the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to 
adopt similar revisions to its good laboratory practice standards. The comments noted that 
unless
EPA amends its good laboratory practice standards to conform them to FDA's GLP  regulations,
nonclinical laboratories will still be required to comply with EPA's more stringent requirements.
Therefore, regardless of any changes that FDA makes in its regulations, laboratories will not
benefit from the revisions unless the EPA regulations are similarly revised.<p>
 FDA recognizes that certain nonclinical laboratories that are subject to FDA's regulations are
also
subject to the good laboratory practice standards established by EPA under the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 135 et seq.) and the Toxic Substances 
Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2600 et seq.). When this final rule becomes effective, some of the 
provisions of the GLP regulations will differ from the good laboratory practice standards 
established by EPA. FDA has consulted with EPA officials respecting the changes to FDA's 
regulations effected by this final rule and will cooperate fully with EPA when that agency 
propose to revise its regulations.<p>

 3. Except for editorial changes to para. 58.1, FDA did not propose to change the scope of Part
58. One comment, however, urged the agency to revise para.  58.1 further to make clear that 
batch release safety tests performed on specific batches of biological products intended for use in
clinical trials after tests to establish the basic safety profile have been conducted are subject  to
the
GLP regulations.<p>

FDA declines to change final para. 58.1 on the ground that the studies described by the comment
are within the current scope of Part 58. The animal tests performed with an investigational
biological product prior to licensing, including the batch release safety tests, are intended to
establish the safety of the product. Accordingly, any such test would constitute a  nonclinical
laboratory study as defined in para. 58.3(d). Because such test would also be  intended to support
a marketing application for a product regulated by FDA, it would be subject to the GLP
regulations.<p>
<br>

<b><a name="Definitions">Definitions</b></a><p>

4.  Four comments endorsed FDA's proposal to change the definition of "control article" in para.
58.3(c)  to exclude from the definition feed and water administered to control groups of a test 
system. One comment, however, expressed concern that, by relaxing essential standards, the 
proposed change would compromise the quality of the animal test.<p>  
FDA does not agree that excluding feed and water from the definition of "control article" will
compromise test quality. The regulations will continue to contain provisions adequate to control
the use of feed ant water in a nonclinical laboratory study. For example, para. 58.31(e) requires
management to assure that materials are available as scheduled, para. 58.45 provides for proper
feed storage, para. 58.81(b)(2) requires the preparation of standard operating  procedures for
animal care (e.g., nutrition), para. 58.90(g) requires periodic analysis of feed and water for
interfering contaminants, and final Section 58.120(a)(7) (formerly Section  58.120(a)(9))
requires
the protocol to contain a description or an identification of the diet, including specifications for
acceptable levels of contaminants.  Other sections of the regulations also apply to feed or water
that is used as a carrier for the test or control article.  For example, Section 58.31(d) requires
management to assure that test and control article mixtures have been appropriately tested,
Section 58.47 requires that a testing facility include storage  areas that are adequate to preserve
the
identity, strength, purity, and stability of such mixtures, and Section 58.113 requires the
laboratory to conduct appropriate analyses for uniformity of the mixture, as well as concentration
and stability of the test article in the mixture. As discussed at  length in the preamble to the
proposal (49 FR 43531), the amendment to Section 58.3(c) will mean that the feed and water
provided to the control groups of a test system will not be subject to certain provisions of the
regulations, e.g., those requiring control articles to be characterized and tested for stability
(Section 58.105), retained as reserve samples (Section 58.195), or accountable with respect to
use (Section 58.107).  As discussed above, however, the  regulations will continue to require the
provision of adequate supplies of feed and water, a description of the feed, proper storage, and
use accountability procedures as directed by the protocol, and standard operating procedures.
Further, only feed and water shown to be free from unacceptable contamination may be used in a
study.<p>  
  For the reasons above, FDA concludes that the change to Section 58.3(c) will not  compromise
the quality of the animal test and that the term "control article" should be reserved for the
discrete
substances/articles and vehicles other than feed and water administered to groups of the test
system to provide a basis of comparison with the test article.<p>  
 5.  Four comments on proposed Section 58.3(d) endorsed FDA's proposal to allow laboratories
to conduct several experiments using the same test article under a single, comprehensive
protocol. 
One comment, however, expressed concern that by amending the definition of "nonclinical
laboratory study," FDA may inadvertently encourage laboratories to establish protocols that (1)
are too brief to assure the quality and integrity of safety data developed  through a study
conducted under the protocol, or (2) do not describe study procedures in  sufficient detail for
such assurance, because lengthy "umbrella protocols" may be difficult to  administer and track
during the amendment process.<p>

  Under the revised definition in Section 58.3(d), a single "umbrella protocol may be used for
concurrent testing of more than one test article using a single common procedure, e.g.,
mutagenicity testing, or for a battery of studies of one test article conducted in several test
systems. Section 58.120 requires that each study have an approved written protocol that clearly
indicates the objectives and all methods for the conduct of the study, and Section 58.33 requires
the study director to assure that the protocol is approved and followed.<p>  
 FDA notes that the changed definition of "nonclinical laboratory study" does not require any
laboratory to establish "umbrella" protocols -- it only allows it as an option. The agency
recognizes that a longer, more complex protocol might be more difficult to manage than a 
simpler one; however, using an "umbrella" protocol should be more efficient than using several
closely related protocols. The quality or accuracy of test data and procedures should not be 
compromised, while the paperwork burden should be reduced. ln any event, the laboratory 
remains responsible for assuring that the validity of any study that it conducts is not adversely 
affected due to an inadequate protocol.<p>

 6. One comment urged FDA to revise further the definition of noncIinicaI laboratory study to
define the terms "study initiation" and "study termination." <p>  
 FDA recognizes that differing words and phrases are used within the GLP regulations to denote
dates respecting significant events that occur during a laboratory study.  For this reason the
agency agrees that it may be useful to add to the regulations definitions of the terms "study
initiation" and "study completion".<p>


 FDA advises that the study initiation date represents the date on which the study director has
completed plans in preparation for the technical conduct of a study (see Section 58.33) and on 
which, under Section 58.31(e), management is required to make certain that personnel,
resources,
facilities, equipment, materials, and methodologies for the study are available as scheduled. On
the
study initiation date, the study is entered on the master schedule sheet (see  Section 58.35(b)(1)). 
After this date, any protocol changes are to be made only in accordance with the procedure
described in Section 58.120(b).  Accordingly, FDA is adding new Section  58.3(o) to define
"study initiation" to mean the date the protocol is signed by the study director. <p>

The study completion date is the date on which the study director signs the final report (see final
Section 58.185(b)). On the study completion date, the study director is required to make  certain
that raw data, documentation, protocols, specimens, and final reports are transferred to the
archives (see Section 58.33(f)), and under Section 58.35, the quality assurance unit may  retire
the
study from the master schedule sheet. This date also specifies the beginning of the  record
retention period under Section 58.195(b).  After the study completion date, final reports may be
amended only in accordance with the procedure described in Section 58.185(c).<p>  
Accordingly, FDA is adding new Section 58.3(p) to define "study completion" to mean the date
the final report is signed by the study director.  As a necessary conforming amendment, FDA is
also amending Section 58.185(b) to provide that the final report shall contain the dated signature
of the study director.<p>

 FDA advises that the phrase "close of the study" as used in Section 58.33(f) refers to the study
completion date.  Also, the terms "terminate" and "discontinue" as used in Section 58.195(b)(3)
are used in their ordinary senses to mean stop, cease, break off, or give up, denoting that a study
has been ended before the planned study completion date. For these reasons, FDA  believes that
these terms do not need any further definition to make clear their meanings.  <p>

 7a. Three comments urged FDA to expand the definition of "raw data" under Section 58.3(k) to
provide that the computer record of "hand-recorded data entered into the computer verbatim  and
verified" could be substituted for the original source as raw data. <p>  
FDA does not agree that the computer record of hand recorded data may be considered as raw
data. Individuals who enter data from a laboratory study into the computer commonly do not
have
any knowledge of the conditions under which the data were collected and may not understand
the
data originator's notations that regularly are included on the hand-recorded  data sheets. The
probability of error in data entry is greatly increased under these circumstances.<p>

  7b. One comment urged the agency to revise Section 58.3(k)  to make clear that the term "raw
data" as it pertains to the findings of the histopathological examinations refers only to the signed
and dated final report of the pathologist.<p>


 FDA does not agree that it needs to amend the definition of raw data relative to the findings of
histopathological examinations. In pertinent part, Section 58.3(k) defines raw data as laboratory
worksheets, records, memoranda, notes, or exact copies thereof, that are the result of original 
observations and activities and are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the final 
report.  Although the notes taken by a pathologist during histopathological examination of slides
are indeed the result of original observations, these notes are not necessary for the reconstruction
and evaluation of the final report. The final report is evaluated by an analysis of the pathology
syndrome as described in the pathologist's report, which is required under Section 58.185(a)(12).
Further, because Section 58.190(a) requires histopathological blocks, tissues, and slides to be
retained as specimens, the final report can be reconstructed by verification of the pathology
findings by, e.g., a second pathologist or by a team of pathologists.<p> 

 The pathologist's interim notes, therefore, which are subject to frequent changes as the
pathologist refines the diagnosis, are not raw data because they do not contribute to study
reconstruction.  Accordingly, only the signed and dated final report of the pathologist comprises
raw data respecting the histopathological evaluation of tissue specimens.<p>  <br>

 8. One comment objected to FDA's proposal to delete the provision in Section 58.31(b) that
requires testing facility management to document as "raw data" the replacement of a study 
director. The comment argued that it could be difficult to retrieve such documentation if data 
were transferred to another location after completion of a study.<p>  
 FDA proposed to delete the requirement in Section 58.31(b) to document study director
replacement as "raw data" in the agency's belief that other provisions of the GLP regulations
adequately require documentation of this event. The agency continues to believe that the 
requirement in Section 58.31(b) is redundant to such other provisions and is not necessary to
assure the quality and integrity of the safety data developed through a study conducted by a 
laboratory. For example, Section 58.35(b)(1) provides that the master schedule sheet shall 
contain the name of the study director. Thus, replacement of the study director would necessitate
an updating of the master schedule sheet.  The master schedule sheet itself is "raw data" because
it
is a record that is the result of laboratory activities and is necessary for the  reconstruction of the
study.  Also, Section 58.120(b) requires that any change in an approved  protocol and the reason
or reasons for the change are to be documented. Because  58.120(a)(11) of the final rule
(previously Section 58.120(a)(15)) requires that the protocol contain the dated signature of the
study director, replacement of the study director would  constitute such a change.  Other
provisions of the regulations require the quality assurance  unit to retain the master schedule
sheet
and copies of protocols as an easily accessible system of records for a specified period after
completion of the study (Section 58.195(d)). Therefore, it should not be difficult to identify the
term of each study director even if records are transferred elsewhere after study completion.<p>

<b><a name="Study Director">Study Director</a></b><p>

 9. Several comments objected to Section 58.33 in its entirety on the grounds that (1) the
regulation does not clearly define the responsibility of the study director and (2) the wording of
the regulation implies that the study director must be technically competent in all areas of a 
study.
One comment argued that the study director should be responsible only for "coordinating" the
technical conduct, interpretation, analysis, documentation, and reporting of results.<p>

 FDA discussed at length in the preamble to the GLP final rule the intent of Section 58.33 and
the
requirements applicable to the individual who is designated the study director for any study (43
FR 59986, 59995; December 22, 1978).  As discussed in that preamble, the study director 
represents the single, fixed point of responsibility for overall conduct of each study. Although 
"coordination" of the pieces of a study logically is part of the study director's responsibilities, to
limit his or her responsibilities to mere "coordination" would compromise public protection if
another person were not such designated fixed point and would add an unnecessary burden if 
FDA were to require a laboratory to employ an additional person to provide such a point. The 
study director is charged with the technical conduct of a study, including interpretation, analysis,
documentation, and reporting of results. FDA does not intend, however, that the  individual is to
be technically competent in all areas of a study.  FDA's inspectional experiences have
demonstrated that if responsibility for proper study conduct is not assigned to one person, a
potential exists for the issuance of conflicting instructions and improper protocol
implementation.<p>

 FDA concludes that the comments did not provide any new data or information to negate the
agency's original determinations and that it should retain Section 58.33 as it was established in 
the December 22, 1978, final rule. <p>

 10. One comment objected to FDA's proposal to delete the phrase "and verified" from Section
58.33(b), which currently requires that the study director assure that all experimental data are 
"verified" as well as accurately recorded. The comment argued that removing the study director's
obligation to assure that the data have been verified would dilute the responsibility of the study
director for proper conduct of the study.<p>

 FDA has carefully reevaluated its proposal to remove the phrase "and verified" from Section
58.33(b).  FDA proposed to delete the phrase from the regulation in response to arguments  from
management of testing facilities that they misinterpreted the provision, apparently believing that
it
required the study director personally to witness each data observation. FDA did not intend the
provision to so require.  Rather, the agency regards the study director as  responsible for assuring
that all experimental data are verified.<p>  
 Ordinarily the verification required by Section 58.33(b) is obtained by the individual collecting
the data, using data verification procedures described in the protocol or in the specific standard
operating procedure, and by the individual's supervisor as part of the supervisory quality control
procedures. "Verified" is used to describe the study director's responsibility to assure the
accurate
recording of data. Verification in this sense does not require the study director to observe every
data collection event but does require the study director to make certain that the study conduct
procedures designated in the protocol for a study and the standard operating  procedures
established for a study are followed. For all these reasons, FDA has decided to  retain the phrase
"and verified'' to confirm the need for data verification in nonclinical laboratory studies.<p>

 11. Two comments urged that the study director's responsibility for assuring placement in the
archives of the study records specified under Section 58.33(f) be transferred to testing facility 
management under Section 58.31.  The comments argued that raw data and documentation are
under the immediate control of facility management rather than the study director.<p>  
 The change suggested by the comments would conflict with the study director's responsibility
identified in Section 58.33 of representing the single point of study control (see paragraph 9 of
this preamble). The archived materials of each study, including raw data and documentation, 
constitute lasting proof of study validity. The transfer of such materials to the archives is a 
critical
step in study control that assures that the archived materials are complete and adequate for study
reconstruction.  lndeed, these revised regulations further emphasize the study director's control
function by defining the study completion date as the date the final report is signed and dated by
the study director; after this date, the study director assures that all required materials are
transferred to the archives. Consequently, FDA declines to accept the change proposed by the
comments.<p>
<br>
<a href="#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<b><a name="QAU">Quality Assurance Unit</a></b><p>

 12. FDA received eight comments regarding Section 58.35(a), which sets forth the composition
and function of the Quality Assurance Unit (QAU). One comment endorsed FDA's proposal to
substitute "which" for the current phrase, "composed of one or more individuals who," to make
clear the personnel who can perform quality assurance duties. The comment suggested, however,
that the agency use the term "function" or "activity" in Section 58.35(a) in place of the current
term "unit" to make it clear that quality assurance monitoring need not be performed by
individuals of a permanently staffed unit.  Four comments disagreed strongly with the proposed
change to Section 58.35(a), arguing that the change inappropriately implies that assurance of a
well-conducted study does not require special training or experience. The comments also
asserted
that verifiable data are produced as a result of the current  requirement for an  independent, fixed
and permanently staffed quality assurance unit. Other comments argued that individuals should
not monitor studies similar to their own work.  Some comments  requested further clarification
of
the required composition of the QAU.<p>  
FDA does not believe that identification of the quality assurance unit as a "function" or "activity"
would serve to clarify the composition or function of the QAU. FDA never has intended that the
QAU necessarily has to be a separate entity or a permanently staffed "unit" (see 43 FR 59996).
"Quality assurance unit" has become an accepted term to describe those individuals responsible
for quality assurance as described in Section 58.35.  FDA also does not agree that the proposed 
revision to Section 58.35(a) implies that assurance of a well-conducted study   does not require
special training or experience on the part of individuals monitoring the conduct and reporting of
a
nonclinical laboratory study. FDA continues to believe that well-qualified and trained personnel
are essential to quality assurance under the GLP regulations and that one of  management's most
important responsibilities in maintaining effective quality assurance is to  provide an adequate
number of such personnel (Section 58.31 (c) and (e)).<p>  
  FDA concludes from the comments that the requirements set forth in Section 58.35(a) have
been
misinterpreted in some instances to mean that the regulations require that the QAU be  composed
of individuals whose sole duties are in quality assurance. In fact, the agency intends  only that
quality assurance activities be separated from study direction and conduct activities;  that is, a
trained and qualified person who works on one study can perform quality assurance  duties on
any
study in which he or she is not involved. FDA's reason for requiring separation of quality
assurance functions from study conduct functions is fundamental -- to assure that quality
assurance personnel can act candidly, without bias or a real or perceived conflict of  interest. In
effecting the separation required by the GLP regulations, FDA was aware that many small
laboratories could not afford the operation of a permanently staffed QAU.  For this reason, the
agency concluded that the separation of functions on a study-by-study basis as  permitted in the
existing and revised regulations would provide effective quality assurance. The agency's intent in
defining the composition and function of the QAU was discussed at length in the preamble to the
current GLP regulations (see 43 FR 59996).  FDA believes that the change now being made
more
clearly reflects the agency's original intent. <p>  
  13. One comment recommended that FDA delete the word "sheet" from the term "master
schedule sheet" in Section 58.35(b)(1) on the ground that there are methods for maintaining a
master schedule other than use of an actual "sheet."<p>

  FDA acknowledges that current technology allows for various methods for maintaining a
master
schedule,  ranging from sophisticated computerized procedures to procedures whereby such
information is contained in written records. Regardless of the method utilized, however,  the
master schedule information is "raw data" within the meaning of the GLP regulations and  copies
of the master schedule are required to be retained in the study archives in accordance  with
Section 58.195(b). The agency is, therefore, retaining the term "master schedule sheet" to
emphasize that the master schedule constitutes raw data subject to agency inspection and that 
the
records must be retained. <p>

 14. One comment suggested that FDA delete the current provision in Section 58.35(b)(1), which
requires a laboratory to include the name of the sponsor of each study on the master  schedule
sheet for all studies conducted at the facility. The comment urged the agency to allow sponsor
identification by code.  <p>

  FDA agrees that including the sponsors' name on the master schedule sheet is not essential
either
for the conduct of management's functions listed in Section 58.31 or for the conduct of  proper
quality assurance under Section 58.35.  Sponsor identification by code is an adequate  procedure,
provided that the name of any sponsor is made available to FDA upon request.  Accordingly,
FDA is amending Section 58.35(b)(1) to read "... identity of the sponsor...".  <p>

  15. One comment suggested that FDA further revise Section 58.35(b)(1) to allow the master
schedule sheet to be indexed by study number rather than test article on the ground that multiple
studies may be performed on each test article.<p>  
  FDA recognizes that a nonclinical laboratory may have in progress several studies on each test
article that is listed on the master schedule sheet. The agency concludes, however, that  indexing
by study number alone and not by test article would be inappropriate.  The master  schedule
sheet
is the mechanism through which the QAU can assure management that the  facilities are
adequate
and that there are sufficient numbers of qualified personnel available to accomplish the
scheduled
work (see 43 FR 59997).  ln addition, Section 58.31(e) requires  management to assure that study
materials (e.g., test articles) are available as scheduled. The  use of study numbers rather than
test
articles as index terms would, therefore, frustrate a major purpose of the master schedule sheet
and impede the conduct of an important management  function. <p>

  16. Three comments endorsed FDA's proposal to delete the current requirement under Section
58.35(b)(1) that the status of the final report be a distinct entry on the master schedule sheet. One
comment, however, objected to the proposal on the basis that frequently there are  delays in
completing the final report, and the study status often is different from the expected  date of
completion of the report.<p>

  FDA believes that the comment that objected to the proposal misconstrued the purpose of
revising Section 58.35(b)(1).  Section 58.35(b)(1) currently requires that the master schedule
sheet contain separate headings for the "current status" of the study and for the "status of the 
final report" of the study. FDA considers the preparation of the final report to be a study event,
current status of which should be reflected on the master schedule sheet. Preparation of the  final
report is similar to other study events (e.g., test article-mixture preparation, test system dosing, in
life observations) that are listed under "current status." Under this revision to   58.35(b)(1), the
master schedule sheet would contain the same information respecting the final report as is
required under the current GLP regulations, but the information would be included only under
the
"current status" heading.  The agency advises that "expected date of completion of a final report"
is not a "status" entry.  Such information has not been required in the past nor is this information
being required now.<p>

 17. FDA proposed to revise Section 58.35(b)(3) to provide specifically that the QAU need only
inspect "each nonclinical laboratory study" on a schedule adequate to assure the integrity of the
study. Four comments recommended that the agency further revise the regulation to  substitute
the word "studies" for the phrase "each nonclinical laboratory study" alleging that inspection of
multiple short duration studies can result in expenditure of significant time and  effort with little
derived benefit.  Two comments argued that inspection of short duration studies conducted
repeatedly at the same facility by the same personnel is not necessary and suggested that, in lieu
of
requiring inspection of each study, standard operating procedures be developed to determine the
inspection frequency of various types of studies. These comments  also recommended that such
inspections be used to demonstrate compliance of other similar  studies conducted in the same
time frame.<p>

 FDA does not agree with the comments. The quality of each nonclinical laboratory study
submitted to the agency in support of an application for a research or marketing permit for a
product regulated by FDA is critical to a determination of the safety of the product. The principle
of quality assurance advanced in the GLP regulations is to inspect studies to identify and correct
problems in a timely fashion. FDA is convinced that such problems can be detected only through
a
program of vigorous inspection of each study. This does not mean, however, that  every phase of
every study needs to be inspected by the QAU (see paragraph 18 of this preamble).<p>

 18. Two comments disagreed with FDA's proposal to modify the current requirement in Section
58.35(b)(3) that the QAU inspect each phase of a study at specified intervals. The comments 
argued that elimination of specified quality assurance inspection intervals may result in
decreased
compliance by cost-cutting laboratories.  Another comment urged FDA to identify the< critical
phases of a nonclinical laboratory study to be inspected by the QAU. <p>  
 Section 58.35(b)(3) currently provides that the QAU is to inspect at periodic intervals each
phase
of a nonclinical laboratory study. For studies lasting more than 6 months, the inspections are to
be
conducted every 3 months.  For studies lasting less than 6 months, the inspections  are to be
conducted at intervals adequate to assure the integrity of the study (including each  phase at least
once). The term "each phase" was intended to emphasize the need for repeated  surveillance so
that the QAU observes at least once during the course of the study each critical operation. The
term "periodic" was included in the regulation to indicate the need for more than one inspection
of
certain repetitive, continuing operations.  In light of current information, however, FDA does not
believe that such a rigid schedule is essential to assure study quality.<p>  
The agency has learned through its inspection program that the quality of toxicology testing is
much higher than that envisioned in 1976 when FDA proposed to establish the GLP regulations
(see 41 FR 51206, 51207-51208; November 19, 1976).<p>

 Contemporary concepts of quality assurance emphasize the effectiveness of thorough, in-depth
inspections of study processes (i.e., all operations required to accomplish a study phase) in place
of quick, spot checks of individual operations with a study. Thorough examination of personnel,
facilities, equipment, standard operating procedures, data collection procedures, raw data books,
and other features associated with a study phase can achieve more effective quality assurance
than
does a more superficial observation of the conduct of the same study phase in a series of
studies.<p>

 The agency has concluded that the QAU's inspection schedule should take into account the need
for inspection of each study on a schedule adequate to assure the integrity of the study being
monitored.  The change in Section 58.35(b)(3) permits the QAU to exercise reasonable
flexibility
and judgment so that  inspections can be scheduled to best achieve the goal of assuring that
studies are properly conducted. The agency advises, however, that each study, no matter how
short, needs to be inspected in-process at least once.  Further, across a series of studies all phases
should be inspected in order to assure the integrity of the studies. For these reasons, FDA does
not believe that the regulation as revised will result in decreased compliance with the GLP
regulations or that the term "critical phase" needs to be defined.<p>  
 19. Eight comments addressed FDA's proposal to delete Section 58.35(b)(4), which currently
requires the QAU to submit periodic written status reports to management and to the study
director. One of the comments supported the proposal on the basis that the provisions of Section
58.35(b)(3), which require reports to management on problems likely to affect study integrity,
are
adequate to assure study quality.  Several comments questioned whether deleting Section
58.35(b)(4) would provide any practical benefit to testing facilities, noting that management is
likely to continue to expect periodic reports. One comment noted that elimination of the
requirement for status reports could allow management to disregard quality assurance problems
if
management is only marginally supportive of good laboratory practice and quality assurance. 
Three comments argued that, by deleting the provision, FDA would inappropriately place on the
QAU rather than on the study director the obligation of determining what constitutes a problem
likely to affect the integrity of a study.  One comment argued that because management is
required to be involved in corrective actions under the provisions of Section 58.31(g) and
58.35(b)(3), management must be kept informed respecting the status and the progress of any
study inspected by the QAU. Another comment suggested that FDA delete the requirement that
status reports be provided to the study director but retain the requirement that management
receive such reports.<p>

 After careful consideration of these comments, FDA has concluded that Section 58.35(b)(4)
should be retained in its current form.  The agency proposed to delete the paragraph based on its
tentative conclusion that routine reports of unremarkable findings by the QAU are not essential
to
study quality.  The comments, however, are persuasive in that such reports are necessary to
demonstrate to management that the QAU is functioning properly.  It is also necessary that the
study director continue to receive such reports because that individual is responsible for all
aspects of any study being conducted by a facility, including GLP compliance.<p> 
 20. One comment suggested that, in lieu of deleting the entire paragraph, Section 58.35(b)(4) be
modified by removing the requirement for status reports on each study, thereby reducing
paperwork.<p>

 In accord with the conclusions stated in paragraph 19 of this preamble, FDA believes that it is
inappropriate to eliminate the requirement for status reports for each study.  Without status
reports on each study, there would not be adequate assurances concerning the quality of the
ongoing studies.<p>

 21. One comment urged FDA to revise current Section 58.35(b)(5) to hold the QAU responsible
only to (1) determine that known deviations from approved protocols or standard operating
procedures were not made without proper documentation, and (2) require authorization for
anticipated deviations. The comment argued that the current wording of the regulation implies
that the QAU shall have prior knowledge of any deviations and shall approve such deviations,
which is not the case in most instances. <p> 

 FDA would not consider a laboratory to have violated Section 58.35(b)(5) if a deviation was not
authorized in advance because it was unanticipated. For example, as recognized in the preamble
to the final rule (43 FR 59998), a fire in the facility would necessitate immediate action.  Also, as
discussed at length at 43 FR 59998, FDA does not intend that the QAU is responsible for
authorizing any deviations from the protocol or standard operating procedures, rather it is
responsible for detecting any such deviations by its inspection and audit procedures.  The
revision
suggested by the comment would remove the accountability of the QAU for detecting deviations
and would undermine the requirements for quality assurance. <p>  
 22. FDA proposed to revise current Section 58.35(b](7) to provide that the statement which the
QAU prepares to accompany the final report would be required to identify the phases of the
study
inspected and the number of inspections conducted.  Eleven comments objected to the proposed
change to the regulation, which currently requires only that the statement by the QAU specify
the
dates that inspections of the study were made, and the dates that findings were reported to
management and to the study director.   Most of the comments were concerned with the
additional reporting burden imposed by the proposed revision. Some of the comments argued
that
the information sought by FDA through the proposed revision in Section 58.35(b)(7) is currently
required under the provisions of Section 58.35(b)(3) and (c). These comments pointed out that
requiring additional documentation would be duplicative and contrary to the stated purposes of
the proposed revisions to the GLP regulations. <p> 

FDA has carefully reevaluated its proposal to require that the QAU statement identify the phases
Or a study inspected and the number of inspections conducted. The agency is persuaded that the
proposal would have provided information redundant to that which is available under other
provisions of the GLP regulations. Accordingly, FDA has decided not to change Section
58.35(b)(7) and is retaining this provision in its current form. Proposed Section 58.35(b)(6) (as
Section 58.35(b)(7) would have been renumbered) is not being adopted.<p>  <br>
<a href="#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<b><a name="Animal Care Facilities">Animal Care Facilities</a></b><p>  
 23. One comment objected to the proposed modification to Section 58.43(c), which would
delete
the current requirement that all laboratory facilities include separate areas for the diagnosis,
treatment, and control of laboratory animal diseases. The comment noted that animal health is a
major problem in toxicology testing. For this reason, the comment argued that any relaxation of
the current requirements in the GLP regulations for animal care is ill-advised and contradictory
to
FDA's  responsibility for the welfare of animals.<p> 

 As discussed in the preamble to the proposed amendments to the GLP regulations (49 FR
43532), a laboratory may elect to dispose of diseased animals, thereby obviating the need for
dedicated areas for such animals.  FDA believes that it is not cost-effective to require separate
areas in every case and has concluded that the decision concerning appropriate separation of
animals should be made by the study direct or in consultation with other scientific personnel. 
The
agency does not believe that providing for dedicated laboratory areas as appropriate
compromises
FDA's continuing commitment to animal welfare, which is specifically dealt with in Section
58.90. 
Indeed FDA believes that the GLP regulations foster quality animal testing under defined
conditions so that fewer animals are required to establish product safety.<p>  <br>
<a href="#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<b><a name="Animal Supply Facilities">Animal Supply Facilities</a></b><p>  <p>

 24.  FDA proposed to revise Section 58.45 to permit laboratories to store perishable supplies or
feed by methods most appropriate to the characteristics of the materials. One comment urged
FDA to amend Section 58.45 further to permit storage of animal feed in rooms housing small
animals or small groups of animals that are isolated from other studies.<p>  
 FDA declines to amend Section 58.45 as recommended by the comment.  In developing the
current GLP regulations, the agency carefully considered whether animal feed or bedding might
be stored within any test areas.  FDA concluded at that time that storage areas needed for feed
and bedding should be separate from the areas housing the test system to preclude mixups and
contamination of test article-carrier mixtures and inadvertent exposure of the test system to
potentially interfering contaminants.  FDA continues to believe that separate storage areas for
feed and animal bedding should be required and the comment did not provide any data to counter
this belief.  FDA advises, however, that Section 58.45 does not preclude holding of limited
quantities of test or control article-feed mixtures for short periods of time in properly constructed
and labeled containers in the animal rooms.<p> 
 
 25.  One comment objected to the proposed changes to Section 58.47, arguing that it believed
the current requirements respecting facilities for handling test and control articles have resulted
in
fewer mixups.<p>

 Based on the comment, FDA has reconsidered the proposed revision of Section 58.47. The
agency agrees with the comment, in principle. Indeed, the agency intended the revision to be
only
editorial to simplify and to make clear that laboratories shall provide separate areas for  receipt,
mixing, and storage of test and control articles and their mixtures as necessary to prevent
contamination or mixups.  Inadvertently, however, the proposed revision would have deleted an
essential requirement of good laboratory practice, i.e., the need to provide storage  areas for test
and control article mixtures adequate to preserve the identity, strength, purity, and stability of the
mixtures.  For this reason, the agency has concluded that the regulation is appropriate as
currently
stated and existing Section 58.47 is retained. <p>  <br>
<a href="#Index">Top of Index</a><p>
<b><a name="Maintenance">Maintenance</a> and Calibration of Equipment</b><p>  <p>

 26. FDA proposed to revise Section 58.63(b) to provide that written standard operating
procedures respecting maintenance and calibration of equipment would allow laboratories to
discard faulty equipment as an alternative to the current provisions of Section 58.63(b), which
provide only for the repair of equipment that fails or malfunctions. Under FDA's proposal, a
testing facility would need to specify remedial action in the event of equipment failure or
malfunction only when remedial action is "appropriate" to the particular piece of equipment.
Three comments recommended that FDA amend Section 58.63(a) to require testing, calibration,
and/or standardization of equipment in accord with written standard operating procedures.  The
comments argued that by changing current Section 58.63(a) in this fashion, FDA might delete
Section 58.63(b) in its entirety without substantively affecting the requirements of the GLP
regulations applicable to laboratory equipment.<p> 

  FDA advises that Section 58.63(b) concerns not only setting forth in standard operating
procedures the details of routine inspection, cleaning. maintenance, testing, calibration. and/or
standardization of equipment, but it also concerns describing remedial actions to be taken when
appropriate if the equipment fails or malfunctions. In promulgating existing Section 58.63(b),
FDA concluded that the specific features set forth in the regulations need to be included in
equipment standard operating procedures because of the crucial role that properly used
equipment
plays in study conduct; a role which pervades every phase of a study and is vital to study quality
and final report integrity. The comments did not provide any data that negate FDA's original
determination. The agency continues to believe that specification of  these features provides
useful
guidance to persons subject to the GLP regulations and concludes, therefore, that it would be
inappropriate to delete Section 58.63(b) from theregulations.<p> 
  27.  Section 58.63(b) requires in part that written standard operating procedures designate the
person responsible for certain operations respecting equipment, i.e., routine inspection, cleaning,
maintenance, testing, calibration, and/or standardization. Although FDA did not propose to
revise
these requirements of Section 58.63(b), three comments stated that by requiring that standard
operating procedures designate an individual responsible for performing each operation, FDA
obligates testing facilities to change their standard operating procedures frequently.  The
comments further argued that the requirement to make a copy of the standard operating
procedures available to laboratory personnel is redundant to the requirements set forth in Section
58.81(c) and should be deleted.<p>

  The comments misconstrue the meaning of the word "person" as it is used in Section 58.63(b).
The second sentence of Section 58.63(b) requires, in pertinent part, that "the written standard
operating procedures shall designate the person responsible for the performance of each
operation
... "  As explained in paragraph 120 of the preamble to the final rule (43 FR 60001), FDA
adopted
the term "person" as defined in Section 58.3(h), rather than the originally proposed term
"individual" to allow the standard operating procedures to designate an organizational unit.<p> 
 The agency agrees with the comment that Section  58.63(b) is redundant to Section 58.81(c)
insofar as it provides for standard operating procedure availability. Accordingly. FDA is
removing
the phrase "and copies of the standard operating procedures shall be made available to laboratory
personnel" from Section 58.63(b).<p>

 28. Section 58.63(c) requires that a testing facility maintain written records of all equipment
inspection, maintenance, testing, calibration, and/or standardizing operations. Two comments
recommended that FDA delete Section 58.63(c) in its entirety, arguing that if management is
satisfied that the standard operating procedures are adequate, further requirements are
unnecessary.<p>

 FDA does not agree with the comments.  FDA carefully considered the necessity for
maintaining
the records specified in Section 58.63(b) when the agency developed the current GLP
regulations.
FDA concluded that such records are necessary to reconstruct a study and to ensure the validity
and integrity of the data that are obtained from a study (see paragraph 26 of this preamble and 43
FR 60001). The purpose of the record retention requirement is to provide documentation
throughout the study of equipment function in accord with design specifications for the
equipment, and equipment use in accord with standard operating procedures for maintenance and
calibration of the equipment.  FDA'S experience in administering the GLP regulations has shown
the benefit of maintaining such records.  For example, through FDA's laboratory inspection
program, the agency has been able to identify the precise period of time of equipment
malfunction
by an examination of the equipment records. Thus, Section 58.63(c) has made it possible to
disregard the data collected by a single defective piece of equipment without having to disregard
all the data obtained from a specific study.<p>

They slung so much mud in the New Hampshire primary, some candidates took to wearing mud boots. "Before I'm through," said 1996 presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander, "I might need a pair of waders."

<p>Such antics may move voters to reach for an antacid, but for a pair of University of Georgia advertising/public relations professors, it simply promises to be another exciting season of research.

<p>Since 1982, Spencer Tinkham and Ruth Ann Lariscy have compiled one of the nation's most extensive studies of U.S. congressional campaigns, probing the sometimes not-so-gentle art of persuasion from the perspective of the candidates, the consultants and the voters.

<p>And especially in the past few years, their research -- along with the rhetoric of the politicians themselves -- has focused on the negative.

<p>"I think a lot of people would like us to find that, yes, negative advertising is a horrible thing and it's turning people away from their beliefs in government," Lariscy said. "But that's not the case. We've found that negative ads actually heighten interest and make people talk about politics even more."

<p>Why candidates use negative ads isn't so difficult to explain: They are the recurrent weapons of winners. The focus of Tinkham and Lariscy's research is on how they work. And the most basic reason may simply be that they are memorable.

<p>"If you get 10 compliments and then one person says really insulting things to you, what are you going to remember?" Lariscy said.

<p>But that apparent simplicity belies the researchers' findings that negative ads are "cognitively more complex" than positive ads. Candidates whose messages are exclusively positive limit the criteria from which potential voters can judge them.

<p>"The funny thing about it is you needn't say anything at all about yourself if you're attacking someone else," Tinkham said. "Conclusions are still reached about both the sponsor and the opponent"

<p>The research shows that you can make yourself look better by making the other candidate look bad, but the reverse isn't true: You can't make the opponent look bad by making yourself look good in positive ads.

<p>"If a candidate runs a positive ad that says, "I'm a Vietnam War veteran and therefore I will be the best person to represent you in Congress," the candidate typically believes that people will infer that his opponent is not a Vietnam veteran," Lariscy said.

<p>"Many consultants believe this practice works," Tinkham said. "But in our study, we found positive ads simply do not work in the same way negative ads do."

<p><b>Successful Strategies</b>

<p>By studying the reactions of more than 200 viewers of 10 test ads -- seven negative, three positive -- Tinkham and Lariscy have identified some principles of successful negative ads. Among them:

<p><b>The news must be new.</b> For example, in 1992, attacks on Bill Clinton regarding alleged sexual indiscretions were relatively ineffective because they were perceived as old news. "Old dirt is just that -- old dirt," Lariscy said. "But if people do not know about it, even if it happened a long time ago -- say that he smoked marijuana 20 years ago and it is just now revealed -- that would be considered new."

<p><b>The message must be believable.</b> "If a candidate places an attack that is clearly off the wall, it is not going to work," Lariscy said.

<p><b>The ad should excite and entertain.</b> While a candidate's stand on the deficit or health care may influence the election through debates or town meetings, the study shows ads that dwell on serious issues have minimal voter impact. However, the persuasive power of an attack is enhanced significantly if the ad is exciting and entertaining.

<p>"We have found a strong, positive relationship between the attitude toward the ad and candidate preference," Tinkham said. "However, we also have found that simply measuring whether the ad is liked does not give a complete picture of the commercial's performance."

<p>For example, the researchers caution that the message can get lost in the delivery. An exceptionally entertaining attack ad can, in effect, become independent of its sponsor: The voter may remember the ad, but may not remember the candidate.

<p>And regardless of the entertainment quotient, there are several forms of attacks that voters rarely embrace. Some topics appear taboo, the researchers said.

<p>"It happens every now and then, but usually ads attacking an opponent's children, wife or husband, sex life, etc. are not done," Tinkham said.

<p>A case in point is the 1992 advertising exchange between Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and challenger Tony Center, which was so harsh that -- even during an exceptionally negative campaign season -- it captured the attention of Newsweek's George Will.

<p>Will recounts how Gingrich's campaign fired off this ad: "Meet Tony Center, a trial lawyer . . . Center actually sued to strip a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old of their child support to pay his own legal fee."

<p>And from the Center camp: "It was Newt who delivered divorce papers to his wife the day after her cancer operation."

<p>"It has to be fair. It can be nasty if it's real and fair," said Tinkham. "Going after a candidate's mother because she's in an insane asylum would be over the line."

<p>Humor is another ticklish area. Most of the political consultants in Tinkham and Lariscy's survey advocated the use of humor; however, the experimental research shows that humor carries an inherent risk.

<p>For instance, in the lab, participants were asked their opinions of a 1984 television ad in which challenger Mitch McConnell uses a pack of bloodhounds to illustrate a search through various vacation spots for incumbent Sen. Dee Huddleston, D-Ky., who McConnell charged was earning $50,000 in speaker's fees on the lecture circuit when he should have been in Congress.

<p>Of the 10 ads viewed by the study group, the humorous bloodhound spot posted the lowest score -- even though, in the real world, McConnell won. Did the ad lead to the win? Tinkham and Lariscy's lab results suggest McConnell won in spite of the ad.

<p>In fact, they have found that so many variables factor into a win or loss that it's difficult to measure the exact impact of attack ads. A negative campaign could fail, for example, because the candidate, in desperation, decided to "go negative" to turn around an already losing campaign.

<p>"If both candidates go negative it levels the playing field a little bit," Lariscy said. "We do know that if one decides to go negative and the other doesn't, the one who doesn't usually ends up very damaged."

<p>The study dispels what is known as the "boomerang" effect, the theory that voters will punish the candidate who goes on the offensive with an attack ad.

<p>"Our research shows that while voters may be somewhat less positive toward a candidate who uses a credible negative ad, the net effect of its use will be positive," Lariscy said.

<p><b>In Defense of Attacks</b>

<p>One of the most definitive findings from the study is that the candidate who is attacked must defend against the ad. Both laboratory studies and case histories have brought Tinkham and Lariscy to this conclusion.

<p>"Negative information does not exist in isolation," Tinkham said. "If the opponent just lets it go under the assumption that nobody will ever believe this, the odds are he or she will lose."

<p>"Candidates sometimes feel they are taking the high road -- you know,  I'm not going to lower myself into the gutter and even respond to that kind of attack,'" Lariscy said. "But no defense is a losing strategy. We found that to not respond is very damaging, very dangerous."

<p>Failure to respond now bears the portentous moniker the "Dukakis effect," which refers to the 1988 presidential campaign in which Michael Dukakis, to a large extent, failed to respond to attacks from opponent George Bush -- and lost handily.

<p>"We believe that was one of the primary factors that hurt Dukakis," Tinkham said.

<p>Early results from Tinkham and Lariscy's current research show that an effective defense should occur as quickly as possible after the attack.

<p>For example, they point to a 1986 ad by Senate candidate Henson Moore of Louisiana chastising his opponent, Rep. John Breaux, D-La., for missing 1,083 votes in the U.S. House. Within 24 hours, Breaux responded with an ad -- mimicking Moore's attack ad -- that concluded "1,083 is the number of jobs lost in Louisiana every 10 working days due to Republican policies sponsored by Henson Moore.

<p>This quick, creative response won over study participants and also may have contributed to Breaux's success at the polls.

<p>The most effective response to an attack ad is made in the same medium where the attack occurred -- television to television, newspaper to newspaper.

<p>"In local races, candidates often respond to a negative broadcast ad with a long endorsement ad in the newspaper," Lariscy said. "You know, one of those ads where 500 people sign their names. Our examination suggests that this is not really appropriate. If you're attacked on the radio, you should respond on the radio."

<p>"If for no other reason than to reach the same audience the attack reached," Tinkham added. "Because audiences are different in different media."

<p>The research also shows that too aggressive a counter-attack actually may be a weak defense.

<p>"When candidates lash back as a form of rebuttal, it is much less effective than a rebuttal that is assertive that says,  this is what my opponent said, and this is why it's not true,'" Tinkham said.

<p>Beating an opponent to the punch -- called "inoculation" by political pundits -- is a relatively recent development in campaigns. Early research results show that while this approach reduces the power of future attacks, a post-attack defense is more effective. Candidate surveys on the same subject show politicians view the preemptive strike as a risky defense.

<p><b>The Power of Money</b>

<p>The 1992 presidential candidacy of Ross Perot and Steve Forbes' bid in 1996 focused attention on the ability of big campaign coffers to sway an election. Tinkham and Lariscy's research confirms the importance of deep pockets -- especially in congressional races where the financial playing field typically isn't level between incumbents and challengers.

<p>"In this respect, the incumbent is at a great advantage over the challenger," Lariscy said. In fact, in data from the 1990 congressional elections, Tinkham and Lariscy found that the power of incumbency, by itself, gives an approximate 16 percentage-point advantage over challengers.

<p>But their study also found that money and incumbency, as in the cases of many losing Democratic incumbents in the 1994 congressional elections, are not everything. A thoughtful campaign strategy can give an under-funded challenger the edge against an incumbent or stronger financed campaign. For example, "using research wisely helps shape message strategy and direct more efficient spending of available dollars," Tinkham said.

<p>Traditional campaign activities -- making personal appearances, distributing posters and canvassing neighborhoods with yard signs -- can also be effective tools. They work, not only for under-funded challengers, but also for incumbents and open-race candidates, the researchers said.

<p>"In general, interpersonal communication has more impact than mass communication," Tinkham said. "It's inherently less efficient on a cost-per-thousand-reached basis, but there is nothing more persuasive than looking someone in the eye and asking them for their vote, contribution or volunteerism."

<p>Surrogates also prove effective at the grass-roots level. These are typically relatives, friends or campaign workers who blanket communities and meet individual voters face-to-face in place of the candidate.

<p>Despite the success of traditional campaign activities, Tinkham and Lariscy have recorded a significant decline in this form of campaigning. "We hate to see it die because it's very powerful," Lariscy said. 

<p>One of the common mistakes of an under-funded campaign is to compensate for lower advertising budgets by seeking out radio talk shows or news interviews for free air time. But Tinkham and Lariscy have found this approach to be one of the greatest risks a candidate can take because the candidate ends up with very little control, if any, over the message.

<p>"Many of them rush to it because it's cheap, but it's very dangerous," Lariscy said. "How many interviewers will let the candidates know the questions in advance?"

<p><b>What To Expect</b>

<p>Recent elections have brought some especially interesting changes for the researchers to study. Now, for example, many incumbent candidates are launching attack ads first -- a tremendous change from only a few years ago.

<p>"It used to be that negativity was the bailiwick of the challenger trying to unseat the all-powerful incumbent," Lariscy said. "Now everyone is doing it."

<p>The 1996 election season also has introduced some new forms of old campaign strategies. Instead of meeting voters door-to-door, many candidates are opting for a home-to-home page approach.

<p>"We think interactive media might stimulate interpersonal communication because it allows the voter to respond and to have input into the process," Tinkham said.

<p>"Of course, the problem with that is that such a small percentage of people currently use the World Wide Web," Lariscy said.

<p>Direct mail advertisements are a current topic of extensive study by the researchers. Between 1982 and 1992, the use of direct mail in congressional campaigns jumped a dramatic 300 percent, they said. Candidates have embraced the approach because it allows them to tailor messages, especially attack messages, for a specific zip code area.

<p>"Direct mail is quite negative because candidates can feel free to attack selectively and to target particular negative arguments to different voter segments," Tinkham said.

<p>The researchers especially are interested in which medium carries the message most effectively. So far, television has led the way in negative campaign advertising. However, the tremendous increase in direct mail mud-slinging provides interesting comparative research, the professors said.

<p>The duo also is considering a new challenge after the 1996 election data is collected. State legislative races appeal to them because an extensive research project, on the level of their congressional study, has not been done at the state level, they said.

<p>While many Americans would prefer the flu over sifting through hours of negative ads, candidate statements and consultant opinions, Tinkham and Lariscy have made these often "muddy" studies their lives' work.

<p> "A lot of times people turn on the TV and they say,  Oh no, it's another political season,'" Lariscy said. "I know it's hard to believe, but we actually thrive on it."

<h4>by Jane Snell</h4><p>
</center>

Here we go again with some interesting questions.  I would appreciate input from my fellow QA
professionals.  All questions are answered under the auspices of the S.Q.A. without personal or
company affiliation.  Send questions to:<p>
<p>
Jane M. Snell<br>
EG&G Mason Research Institute<br>
57 Union Street<br>
Worcester MA 01608<p>
<p>
<b>Question 1:</b>  Our QAU has kept complete records of every final report audit we have
conducted. 
This includes QAU audit forms (checklists, sign off sheets) and materials audited (table and
report drafts).  Is it acceptable for us to now discard these items (at least for reports issued 5-10
years ago)?<p>

Please note that the QA statement issued with all of our final reports contains a signed statement
that the report tables and raw data were compared and audited for accuracy and adherence to
appropriate SOPs, protocols and GLPs.  Also, please note that I am not referring to critical phase
inspection/audit records which we would never discard.<p>
<p>
<b>Response 1 (Dr. Paul Lepore, FDA):</b> Miscellaneous records prepared by the Quality
Assurance
Unit are subject to the same retention requirements as are all other records of a nonclinical
laboratory study.  For FDA regulated products, records are to be retained for a period of 5 years
<i>after completion of a study.</i> [Error, see a <a href="#v4n3a">correction</a> to this
response here.  Editor]<p>
<p>
<b>Question 2:</b> Is it acceptable to state in the protocol that the formulation instructions will
be
provided by the sponsor and attached to the protocol as Attachment 1?  This would be stated in
the protocol at the time of signature when the actual formulation may not be determined.<p>
<p>
<b>Response 2 (Dr. Paul Lepore, FDA):</b> I am uncomfortable with a procedure whereby
various
"attachments" to a protocol are winding their way through the corridors of a laboratory.  It seems
to me that it would be difficult to assure that the proper attachment was sent to the proper person
and that each involved person had all required attachments.  It also seems to me that the
"attachment" referred to by the questioner is in reality a protocol amendment which can be made
at any time by the study director.<p>
<p>
<b>Question 3:</b> Does FDA have guidelines for immunotoxicology studies or can you
recommend a source?<p>
<p>
<b>Response 3 (Dr. Paul Lepore, FDA):</b> FDA does not currently have guidelines for
conducting
immunotoxicology studies.  However, both our Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and
our Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition have guideline development projects
underway.  I would suppose that a guideline would be available within the next year.<p>

  Before shedding some light on six new questions, I would like to draw attention to the
CORRECTION in the response to Question #1 in the <a href="#v4n2">May 1989 SQA
Newsletter, (Volume 4,
Number 2). </a>The correction to the response to Question #1 is highlighted below:<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #1</b>: Our Quality Assurance Unit (QAU) has kept complete records of every
final
report audit we have conducted. This includes QAU audit forms (checklists, sign off sheets) and
materials audited (table and report drafts). Is it acceptable for us to now discard these items (at
least for reports issued 5 - 10 years ago?...)<p>

<p>

<b>Response</b>: Miscellaneous records prepared by the QAU are subject to the same retention
requirements as are all other records of a nonclinical laboratory study. For FDA regulated
products, records are to be retained for a period of 5 years after <b>submission of a study report
to
FDA.</b><p>

<p>

All responses to the following questions are from <b>Dr. Paul Lepore</b>, U.S. FDA.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #1</b>: Part 58.35 of the GLPs states that the QAU shall maintain copies of all
protocols
pertaining to all nonclinical laboratory studies for which the unit is responsible.<p>

<p>

  When a final report is issued, our Toxicology Department archives the original protocol,
amendments, raw data, and final reports. Our QAU archives all QA records, including the
protocol and amendments about 2 years after the report issue.<p>

<p>

  In this case, is it necessary for QAU to maintain a separate copy in the archives along with
other pertinent QA study file records?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #1</b>: No<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #2</b>:  During quarantine, the health status of the animals is assessed at our
facility.
Daily observations are recorded, and any individual abnormalities noted. Samples are collected
and processed for clinical pathology and bacteriological review. All animals received must be
cleared for use by a veterinarian and the animals are either used for study, in which case
randomization and identification would occur, or sick animals are culled and the status
documented in the quarantine records.<p>

<p>

  Because it is preferable to identify the animals after randomization, the animals are often not
identified during quarantine. Is it acceptable to document the status without identifying the
animal by number?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #2</b>: Yes<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #3</b>: At our facility several machines interface with a computer in our clinical
pathology laboratory. The individual machines each generate a printed value in addition to the
value being sent to the computer for inclusion in tabular and statistical manipulation. In addition,
the computer can generate an animal report listing all parameters for that given subject. We
would like to consider the "animal reports" generated by the computer as the raw data and define
them as such in our SOP. All values are verified prior to completion of the data set, and a
supervisor reviews all data. If this is acceptable, how long, if at all, do we have to maintain the
individual machine generated data output?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #3</b>: Yes, this is acceptable. I n the example, the machine generated data output
(the
printed value) and the information in the computer media are considered to be exact copies of
raw data. Accordingly, it is not necessary to retain the machine generated data outputs at all.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #4</b>: We are a contract lab and recently have received a protocol that states
that all
data, materials and specimens will be returned to the sponsor for archiving after submission of
the final report. For legal reasons, we will photocopy all raw data (unless on disk) prior to
shipment to the sponsor. This is a precaution in case the original materials should get lost or
damaged. We maintain shipment inventories and documentation of receipt of shipment by the
sponsor and the location is documented for the file. We would like to discard the photocopies
when receipt of materials has been acknowledged. Does the Agency envision any problems with
this?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #4</b>: No.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #5:</b> As part of establishing the health of primates during quarantine, we
collect blood
samples for hematology and serum chemistry evaluation. As part of the hematology profile, a
differential is prepared and read. At this point, the primate may or may not have been assigned to
a study.<p>

<p>

  After 6 weeks, the veterinarian will review all animal data and release the shipment from
quarantine. If the primate has been assigned to a study, all quarantine data goes to that study file
when the animal is released from quarantine. We would like to maintain all slides generated as
part of the quarantine assessment in the clinical services lab and only include the study data for
the study file. Is this acceptable?<p>

<p>

<b>Response #5</b>: Yes. You should recognize that this procedure makes the clinical services
lab a
part of the archives which requires security procedures as per section 58.190(d) of the GLPs.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #6</b>: 21 CFR, Part 58.83 addresses reagents and solutions and their labeling.
What is
the FDA's position on solvents, i.e., methanol, alcohol, acetone, toluene, etc.? At our lab, we
record the date of receipt on the manufacturer's label. Is this sufficient?<p>

<p>

Response: No. All reagents, solvents, chemicals, and solutions in a GLP compliant laboratory
must bear expiration dates.<p>

<p>

  Please send all questions to me at the address below. All questions will be answered under the
auspices of the SQA without personal or company affiliation.<p>

<b>Communication From Dr. Lepore of the FDA</b><p>

</center>
<p>

  At the last SQA Meeting, I gave misleading answers to two questions that were asked during
the breakout sessions. Accordingly, I ask that you publish the following clarifications in the next
issue of your Newsletter.<p>

<p>

<b>Question  1</b>:  Is it acceptable to use an "electronic" signature procedure to denote an
approval of
study protocols?<p>

<p>

<b>Response 1</b>:  No. The GLPs provide that each study shall have an approved written
protocol
[Section 58.120 (a)]. The written protocol, of course, would have to be approved by the written,
dated signature of the study director.<p>

[However, see the more current draft of FDA's new <a href="./fdaelsig.html">electronic
signature policy</a> here.  Editor]
<p>

<b>Question  2</b>. Must wet specimens, other than those obtained from mutagenicity tests and
wet
specimens of blood, urine, feces and biological fluids, be retained from each study?<p>

<p>

<b>Response 2</b>:  Yes. See Section 58.195(c).  <p>

<h3>FIFRA GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICES WORKSHOP</h3>
<p>

A Synopsis by Patrick O. Jones<p>

</center>
<p>

  A FIFRA Good Laboratory Practices Workshop was held on January 8, 1990 in the Washington
D.C. area.<p>

<p>

  The workshop was sponsored by the National agricultural Chemical Association and the Office
of Compliance Monitoring, Environmental Protection Agency. The workshop moderator was Dr.
Roy McAllister, Director of Regulatory Affairs, NACA. Key EPA members present were: David
Dull, Phyllis Flaherty, and Stephen Howie of the Office of Compliance Monitoring, Washington
D.C.; Dean Hill and Diane Bradway, NEIC, Denver, Colorado.<p>

<p>

  The purpose of the workshop was to address questions and concerns which have surfaced as a
result of the EPA GU Regulations which became effective on October 16,1989. The EPA
members identified in the preceding paragraph formed a panel to address a number of questions
that had been submitted to them prior to the workshop. The questions consisted of five main
topic areas, which were: Auditors/Audits Inspections, Field Studies/Test Facility Operations,
Standards, Equipment, and Sample and Data Retention.<p>

<p>

  Many of the questions submitted were not addressed, or were only partially answered. A
synopsis of several of the more important or controversial topics will be presented in this article.
NACA and EPA indicated that a written report will be issued to all attending as a follow-up to
the meeting.<p>

<p>

   <b>Question #1</b>: How will the agency assure consistency among its inspectors? Will there
be
training for inspectors and a manual for standard auditing procedures?<p>

<p>

<b>  Answer #1</b>: The agency indicated that they will be conducting a field training seminar
at the
USDA facility in Tipton, Georgia this summer. There apparently will be no Inspector's manual
or standard auditing procedures as it is felt that there are too many unique situations. It was
indicated that policy letters will routinely be sent to all inspectors which will aid in achieving
uniformity.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #2</b>: How often will audits be scheduled?<p>

<p>

<b>  Answer #2</b>: This will depend on past history of problems. There are no clear cut
intervals at
this time.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #3</b>: Can the issue of having multiple study directors be resolved?<p>

<p>

<b>  Answer #3:</b> The Agency feels that for each study there must be one study director as
the single
point of control. The study should not be broken into several "smaller" studies with multiple
study directors. EPA recognizes that there may be some problems inherent in this philosophy
and has indicated that it will give the issue further consideration. However, at this point the
single study director concept is the law.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #4</b>: What can the agency do to improve feedback to industry from their
inspectors?<p>

<p>

<b>  Answer #4</b>: EPA recognizes that there may be a year or more delay In getting a written
report
in some cases. They suggested that full use be made of the exit interview to address problems
found during the audit. It was indicated that there should be nothing in the written report that
was not discussed at the exit interview.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #5</b>: Will the EPA perform the first audit as an "informal" audit to allow both
parties
an opportunity to learn and adjust procedures?<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #5</b>: No. As of October 16, 1989 the regulations became law, and any parties
subject to
them are responsible for compliance.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #6</b>: Can EPA provide a proposed list of items that auditors will be looking
for in a
field experiment situation?<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #6</b>: No, each situation is unique. However, there are some things that are
considered
generic. As a starting point, the auditor will probably verify that all records described in the
protocol are being maintained.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #7</b>: If GLP calibration is documented in a field study with more than one
application,
is recalibration needed at each subsequent application or can specific parameters be checked,
with reference to the initial calibration?<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #7</b>: Yes, if parameters can be shown to verify calibration However, it is
probably better
to document a calibration event for each application.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #8</b>: What kind of documentation is needed on surfactant added to spray
mixtures,
such as crop oils or X-77.<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #8</b>: Only lot #, expiration dates, etc. No analysis or characterization is
required.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #9</b>: There is difficulty in understanding the logic and/or need for requiring
that empty
test substance storage containers be retained long term. Why must these containers by
retained?<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #9</b>: EPA believes that all empty test substance containers should be retained
until the
end of the study, that being defined as the date the final report is signed by the study director. It
is felt that this is necessary to verify use and material balance. If retention of containers causes
undue hardship, the Agency should be contacted for permission to dispose of the containers prior
to the end of the study.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #10</b>: Does EPA know what information is necessary for compliance of aerial
application studies?<p>

<p>

<b>  Answer #10</b>: Calibration of aircraft as described by protocol and/or SOP.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #11</b>: Is water analysis required for residue studies?<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #11</b>: No, it is recommend that pH and temperature be recorded just prior to
mixing.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #12</b>: Can a system be installed which allows the individual performing the
work to
authorize a deviation from SOPs?<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #12</b>: SOPs and protocols should be written with enough flexibility that
deviations are
minimized. However, the study director can authorize or acknowledge a deviation after the fact,
and determine the impact on the study at that time. A planned departure from an SOP should be
cleared with the study director.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #13</b>: How does EPA prepare to coordinate the inspection of all facets of
these
complex studies, so that work done in several geographical areas can be adequately monitored?
Does the Agency expect that all raw data from these areas be archived at a central location?<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #13</b>: The Agency cannot get to every contractor/field site. Audits will
normally be
conducted at the contract laboratory that is managing a group of field studies. Raw data does not
need to be archived in a central location, but must be retrievable. If a field study is audited in-life
at the managing laboratory, it may be necessary to call in raw data (or verified copies thereof)
from a cooperator.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #14</b>: The GLPs state that certain specimens and samples do not need to be
retained
after quality assurance verification. What constitutes, or what is meant by quality assurance
verification?<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #14</b>: It is not clear what is intended at this time. This issue will be
clarified.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #15</b>: How often must the Quality Assurance Unit inspect a study?<p>

<p>

<b>  Answer #15</b>: The GLP regulations state at adequate intervals to assure the integrity of
the
study. It would seem that a minimum of at least one inspection should be conducted on each
study.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #16</b>: If you list compliance deviations in the GLP compliance statement, are
you
subject to compliance action?<p>

<p>

  <b>Answer #16: </b>Possibly. It would depend on the type of deviation and to what degree it
impacted
the integrity of the study.<p>

<p>

  This basically summarizes some of the important topics discussed. Again, many of the
questions were not addressed due to time constraints but should be responded to in the
forthcoming written Agency report.<p>

<h3>EPA GLP Information Sharing</h3>

<center><h4>Shared TSCA GLP Information</h4>
</center>
<p>

<b>   Question 1:</b> The following is a situation encountered by a sponsor during the process
of
carrying out a Section 4 Test Rule Program. A request for exception to the GLP regulations for
the storage of all empty test article storage containers was denied. A reconsideration was
requested and the exception was granted. The empty test article storage containers do not have to
be kept for the duration of the study; however, a great deal of paperwork is required to be
maintained.<p>

<p>

  The following paragraphs are paraphrases of the requests as well as EPA's response.<p>

<p>

  Request for exception to the GLP Regulations: Although the GLPs only require that storage
containers be assigned to a particular test substance for the duration of the study, this
requirement has been interpreted to mean that empty storage containers must be maintained until
the completion of the study, presumably until the final report is issued. Due to the large quantity
of test material required for this study, storage of empty containers presents an unmanageable
problem in this testing program. It will be dangerous, and more importantly will not provide
EPA with the information intended to be gained by the regulation. An exemption from the
interpretation of the GLP regulations is requested, as an accurate accounting of storage
containers, which is the intent of the GLP regulations, can be achieved without maintaining the
actual empty containers. The following records are presently being maintained to keep an
accurate account of the storage containers: 1 ) receipt of test article in the storage warehouse; 2)
shipment of each container leaving the warehouse (shipping request record, bill of lading, carrier
bill and monthly inventory of warehouse activity; 3) test article receipt at each testing facility; 4)
return shipment of empty containers from the testing facility to the warehouse (bill of lading and
carrier bill); 5) receipt of the empty containers at the warehouse (monthly inventory of
warehouse activity); and 6) record of the final destination of the containers (receipt from recycler
or reclaimer).<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 1</b>: The provisions for assignment of storage containers for the duration of the
study
in 40 CFR 792.105 (c) is a logical and necessary provision that in most cases provides
accountability of test material in a manner that imposes no unusual burden. In this particular
case, however, the test article storage containers are large and numerous, and may pose unusual
safety as well as encumbrance problems, resulting in a potentially unusual burden. The record
keeping steps that you described (above) could provide the basis for establishing an acceptable
alternate method for the accounting of test substance storage containers in lieu of actual storage
of the containers for the duration of the study. Consequently, the decision has been made to
conditionally allow an exception in this case.  This exception is applicable to this specific case
and is conditional on the following: <p>


<ol>
  <li>Sponsor must assure that the records described above are maintained as raw data for this
study. Certified copies of these records (dated and signed by responsible persons) will be
acceptable as raw data. </li>
  <li>The statement of compliance required by 40 CFR 792.12 must describe the exception to the
GLPs in accordance with the conditions provided. </li>
  <li>The sponsor shall maintain an inventory of all empty containers before disposal, including
sufficient information to uniquely identify containers, and shall maintain this inventory in an
up-to-date manner, recording all arrivals of empty containers and their disposal. </li>
  <li>The sponsor shall identify the locations of facilities: where test material is stored; where
empty containers are stored prior to disposal or recycling; where records of shipment of
containers are maintained; and where test substance is used in studies (testing facilities).</li>
</ol>
<p>

<h4><center>Shared FIFRA GLP Information</h4>
</center>
<p>

   <b>Question #1</b>: Do organic solubility studies need to be conducted under the GLP
standard
required by Section 160.135(a) as do the water solubility studies or may they be conducted under
modified Section 160.135(b)?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response #1</b>: Section 160.135 does not distinguish between organic solvent and water
solubility studies. Since there is no distinction in the regulations, you must assume that any
solubility study, including organic solvent solubility, is subject to the full regulations.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #2</b>: In characterizing the test substance prior to the initiation of the study, can
only
those impurities greater than 5% be identified?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #2</b>: Section 160.105(a) of the GLPs requires adequate test, reference, and
control
substance characterization to be performed and documented before study initiation. "Adequate"
characterization, e.g., specific level of impurities, is study-specific and hence not defined further
in the GLPs. It is appropriate to consult with the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) to
determine if there are characterization requirements beyond those that your laboratory believes
are sufficient. A decision to reject a study may by made by OPP independently of GLP
compliance. Documentation as to when the levels of impurities were identified should be
included in your submission to OPP.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #3</b>: How does one perform computer validation of analytical results?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #3</b>: Design and use of an automated data collection system falls under GLPs
if the
system is used in the generation of raw data as defined in Section 160.130(e). In such cases, the
equipment must be of "appropriate design and adequate capacity" as specified in Section 160.61,
and be"adequately tested, calibrated and/or standardized," maintained, and records kept, as
specified in Section 160.63. Written SOPs are required for this equipment. No distinction is
made between the automated data collection equipment and other analytical instrumentation, so
the same standards must be interpreted to apply to both. As long as the data capture system
meets these criteria, there is latitude in its design. Again, the testing facility will be expected to
provide documentation in the form of SOPs and other written records to support the validity of
the system, however it is designed.<p>

<h3>Regulatory Affairs Questions &amp; Answers</h3>
</center>
<p>

  Please send questions to me at the address below. All questions will be answered under the
auspices of the SQA without personal or company affiliation.<p>

<p>

Jane M. Snell<br>
TSI Mason Research Institute <br>
57 Union Street<br>
Worcester, MA 01608<br>
<p>

  All responses to the following questions are from Dr. Paul Lepore, U.S. FDA.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #1</b>: Which studies must be listed on the Master Schedule Sheet?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response #1</b>: FDA GLPs are quite clear on this matter. A laboratory's Quality
Assurance Unit
is to maintain a copy of a master schedule sheet which lists all nonclinical laboratory studies
conducted at the testing facility (see section 58.35(b) (1). In contract laboratories, preparation of
the listing is facilitated by Section 58.10 which requires study sponsors to notify the laboratory
of the need to conduct a study in compliance with the GLPs.<p>

<p>

  It has come to FDA's attention that certain contract labs are not listing all nonclinical laboratory
studies on FDA regulated products on the Master Schedule Sheet. This is poor practice.<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #2</b>: It is unclear in the FDA &amp; EPA GLPs whether or not a study
protocol can allow
multiple test articles to be applied simultaneously, but on different sites on the same animal (i.e.,
for an acute dermal irritation). Is it allowable?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #2</b>: The GLPs do not dictate whether or not several test articles can be
simultaneously administered to the same animal. This issue concerns a scientific aspect of a
study which should be discussed with the preclearance units of the FDA prior to
implementation.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #3</b>: Where can a list be obtained of cleaning agents for cage washers, room
sanitization etc.) which are acceptable to the FDA and EPA? How can we determine if what we
are currently using is FDA and/or EPA approved?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response #3</b>: I have been unable to locate a list of cleaning/sanitizing agents which are
federally approved for use on animal contact surfaces. However, FDA would accept
cleaning/sanitizing procedures conducted in accord with Section 3.10(b) (3) of the proposed
amendments to the animal welfare regulations (Federal Register vol. 49, page 10936. March
15,1989).<p>

<p>

  <b>Question #4</b>: We usually certify that any copy made of raw data is an exact copy
(stated as
such, then dated and initialed). For a final report which has copies of the raw data as its
appendices, is it required to state on them that they are exact copies?<p>

<p>

  <b>Response #4</b>: The stated procedure is acceptable as a means of conferring raw date
status to an
exact copy of raw data. The procedure need only be used when the exact copy will substitute for
the "original" raw data. In this regard, l do not consider the final report to contain raw data and it
is not required to certify the raw data copies included therein.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #5</b>: Our facility archives for paper and specimens have reached capacity and
we are
considering off-site storage. So long as the storage company we use meets our environmental
storage conditions, can provide us with inventory/location material listings in their facility and
has restricted access, does the FDA or EPA foresee any difficulties with this? We plan to keep
copies of the final reports and a copy of the computer report from the storage company in an
archive file at our facility. We also plan to make quarterly visits (is this excessive?) to check the
place out.<p>

<p>

<b>  Response #5</b>: I am not sure if there are problems with the described scenario. As I see
it, the
off-site storage facilities are considered to be satellite archives to the central archives located at
your facility. Procedures that apply to the satellite archives are to be adequate and contained
within the standard operating procedures that apply to the central archives. Also, I presume that
the "we" who plan to make quarterly visits represent your quality assurance unit discharging
their inspection responsibilities.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question #6</b>: We have recently been purchased and our company name has been
changed. Is it
necessary to amend the protocol?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response #6</b>: No. <p>

<h3><center>EPA GLP Information Sharing</h3>
<p>

</center>
  Many questions have been posed on the interpretation of the revised TSCA and FIFRA EPA
GLPs. This column has been established to enable those who have received written responses
from the Agency to share them with others. As in other columns of this nature, all information
will appear without personal or company affiliation. If you have information you are willing to
share, contact:<p>

<p>

Dr. Willa Garner <br>
Quality Associates, Inc. <br>
10310-B Baltimore National Pike <br>
Ellicott City, MD 21043<br>
<p>

<b>Question  1</b>: Testing facilities may consist of a test substance/analysis laboratory, the
test system
exposure facility (the field), and the sample analytical laboratory. The separation of locations
and sites is very apparent in the conduct of field residue studies.<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 1</b>: The definition of study reads, "any experiment at one or more test sites in
which a
test substance is studied in a test system under laboratory conditions or in the environment to
determine or help predict its effects, metabolism, product performance (efficiency studies only as
required by 40 CFR 158.640), environmental and chemical fate, persistence and residue, or other
characteristics in humans, or other living organisms, or media." The term "study" does not
include basic exploratory studies carried out to determine whether a test substance or a test
method has any potential utility.<p>

<p>

  A single study may require several experiments to be conducted at several locations. The
separation of locations by a physical distance does not in itself justify defining experiments as
separate studies and assigning separate study directors to them. According to the language in
both the 1983 and 1989 GLP rules, there shall be one overall study director for each reported
study. Although there may be distinct locations and/or disciplines involved, there is still a need
for each study to have a single scientist or other professional of sufficient knowledge and
training to act as the single point of study control.<p>

<p>

  If the experiments are a "study" as defined in the GLPs, then the requirements of the GLPs need
to be complied with, i.e., a study director, protocol, quality assurance unit, report, and all other
applicable provisions would be required.<p>

<p>

 <b>Question 2</b>: Basic exploratory studies are those involved in method development, such
as the
development and validation of analytical methods.<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 2</b>: The term "exploratory studies" does not have the regulatory meaning as
suggested.
Certain method development and validation studies could be exploratory, but others may be
required in support of registrations. Some exploratory studies may have nothing to do with
method development. Studies being performed for submission to EPA should be regarded as
being subject to the GLPs, while studies performed entirely for internal use would not require
compliance.<p>

<p>

<b> Question 3</b>: In relation to multiple study locations, can a study director be designated
for
individual locations? Also, can a single study director be designated for multiple locations?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 3</b>: The GLPs state in Section 160.33 that the study director represents the
single point
of study control. The GLPs also define the term study as an experiment conducted "at one or
more locations." We interpret this as meaning that the study director may, by definition, be
responsible for more than one location of experimental work. Testing facility management is still
responsible to assure that adequate personnel are available at all locations, as stated in section
160.31 (e).<p>

<p>

<b>Question  4</b>: When contracting field residue studies, can the sponsor define the
contractor's
location as a facility?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 4</b>: The GLPs define the testing facility as "the person who actually conducts
the
study." This includes a contractor, who performs the experimental work involved in the study.
Please note that the term "testing facility" will include multiple locations. It will also include
more than one physical location, if the study is performed at multiple locations. It will also
include more than one organizational unit if more than one organizational unit is involved in the
study's conduct.<p>

<p>

<b>Question  5</b>:  Does GLP cover only the quality and integrity of study data generated and
not the
science of the study?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 5</b>: GLPs are primarily intended to ensure data quality and integrity. Insofar
as
scientific methodologies affect this, e.g., instrument calibration, test article characterization, etc.,
they are subject to the GLPs. Also, a GLP violation would occur if a protocol was not followed.
Please note that EPA has regulations and guidelines besides GLPs which determine what studies
are required and how such studies are to be conducted.<p>

<p>

<b>Question 6</b>: GLPs do not apply to routine manufacture or to starting material used.<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 6:</b> This is true where such processes are not performed as studies intended
for
submission to EPA. Should the submission of such data be required by EPA, it would be subject
to the regulations.<p>

<p>

<b>Question 7</b>: Master schedule sheets are maintained by the quality assurance units of the
testing
facilities as a record of all studies conducted at the facilities. The main purpose of these sheets is
to facilitate audits by EPA or FDA.<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 7</b>: Master schedule sheets are required by the regulations as described.
However, we
do not believe that your statement is accurate in describing the main purpose of the master
schedule as facilitating audits by the Agency. EPA uses the master schedule to determine the
adequacy of the testing facility, i.e., whether the facility is of sufficient size and has sufficient
personnel to perform the studies that are listed. Finally, the master schedule is presumed to be
necessary to the testing facility itself, e.g., for use by the QAU to assist in tracking studies and
scheduling internal audits.<p>

<p>

 <b>Question 8</b>: Retention of record and samples is largely dictated by the study protocol.
In
metabolism studies only the major metabolites need be retained as reference samples. Samples
analyzed during stability studies need not be retained.<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 8</b>: Retention of records and samples is required by the regulations, which
cannot be
superseded by the protocol. The protocol will largely determine what records and samples are
generated during the course of the study, and all such raw data must be retained. The GLPs do
allow that certain samples need not be retained longer than they afford evaluation, and that
certain specimens need not be retained after quality assurance verification [Sections
160.195&copy;
and 792.195(c)]. These provisions are made to allow the discarding of certain samples or
specimens whose retention would not provide useful data integrity assurance.<p>

<p>

<b>Question 9</b>: Will it be necessary to submit copies of individual field trial notebooks as
part of a
multiple trial data submission or may summaries of raw data on test conditions for each location
be submitted?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 9</b>: Under GLPs, a summary and analysis of the raw data are required in the
study
report [Section 160.185(a)(11)], but not a complete copy of raw data. Program-specific
guidelines that indicate a need for submission of raw data should be referenced to determine
whether a copy of raw data, i.e., field records, is required in the report. In any case, the original
raw data would need to be archived at the completion of the study and the location of the
archives listed in the final report.<p>

<p>

<b>  Question 10</b>: The preamble for the standards indicated that "... each study no matter
how short
must be inspected at least once while in progress".  However in Subpart B 792.35(b)(3) and
Subpart B 160.35 (b) (3) it is indicated that studies are to be inspected at intervals adequate to
ensure the integrity of the study. Does the preamble comment exclude the possibility of interval
inspections as allowed by FDA? How does the preamble comment relate to screening pilot and
range-finding studies which are not routinely Inspected and are not considered GU studies by the
FDA? I was told by an EPA staff member that a range-finding teratology study was subject to
GLPs and required laboratory inspection. Could you explain why these studies (run to establish
dosage levels for a definitive study) would be viewed differently from other range-finding
studies? If EPA does not feel that a random inspection program is an appropriate method of
evaluating a study (as indicated in a statement in the preamble) what is suggested for appropriate
quality assurance review of short-term repetitive type studies?<p>

<p>

<b>  Response 10</b>: The GLPs state in Sections 160.35(b) and 792.35(b) that the QAU
"inspect each
study at intervals adequate to ensure the integrity of the study." While this does not specify the
number of intervals, we believe that in any case where a study is not inspected, i.e., at least once,
there is a clear GLP violation. The preamble statement concerning random inspections was
directed at the concept of allowing random selection of some studies for inspection instead of
inspecting all studies. For the reasons stated, we do not believe that the regulations allow
this.<p>

<p>

  Finally, we do not view range finding pilot or screening studies as requiring GLP compliance
unless they are being performed either as a study or as part of a study (i.e., specified in the
protocol of a study) that is to be submitted to EPA.  There is no specific regulatory requirement
that each pilot or range finding study performed as part of a larger study be inspected by the
QAU, as long as each larger study is inspected as required. The QAU may find it necessary to
inspect some pilot studies to assure the integrity of data from these portions of the studies.<p>

<DT>(a) A testing facility shall permit an authorized employee or duly designated representative
of
EPA or FDA, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, to inspect the facility and to
inspect
(and in the case of records also to copy) all records and specimens required to be maintained
regarding studies to which this part applies. The records inspection and copying requirements
shall not apply to quality assurance unit records of findings and problems, or to actions
recommended and taken, except the EPA may seek production of these records in litigation or
formal adjudicatory hearings. 
<DT>(b) EPA will not consider reliable for purposes of showing that a chemical substance or
mixture
does not present a risk of injury to health or the environment any data developed by a testing
facility or sponsor that refuses to permit inspection in accordance with this part. The
determination that a study will not be considered reliable does not, however, relieve the sponsor
of a required test of any obligation under any applicable statute or regulation to submit the
results
of the study to EPA.

<DT>(a) The sponsor or any other person who is conducting or has conducted a test to fulfill the
requirements of a testing consent agreement or a test rule issued under section 4 of TSCA will be
in violation of section 15 of TSCA if: 
<DL><DT>(1) The test is not being or was not conducted in accordance with any requirement of
this part; 
<DT>(2) Data or information submitted to EPA under this part (including the statement required
by Section 792.12) include information or data that are false or misleading, contain significant
omissions, or
otherwise do not fulfill the requirements of this part; or 
<DT>(3) Entry in accordance with Section 792.15 for the purpose of auditing test data or
inspecting
test facilities is denied. Persons who violate the provisions of this part may be subject to civil or
criminal penalties under section 16 of TSCA, legal action in United States district court under
section 17 of TSCA, or criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 2 or 1001. 
</DL>
<DT>(b) EPA, at its discretion, may not consider reliable for purposes of showing that a
chemical
substance or mixture does not present a risk of injury to health or the environment any study
which was not conducted in accordance with this part. EPA, at its discretion, may rely upon such
studies for purposes of showing adverse effects. The determination that a study will not be
considered reliable does not, however, relieve the sponsor of a required test of the obligation
under any applicable statute or regulation to submit the results of the study to EPA. 
<DT>(c) If data submitted to fulfill a requirement of a testing consent agreement or a test rule
issued
under section 4 of TSCA are not developed in accordance with this part, EPA may determine
that
the sponsor has not fulfilled its obligations under section 4 of TSCA and may require the sponsor
to develop data in accordance with the requirements of this part in order to satisfy such
obligations.

areas, as
needed, to ensure: proper separation of species or test systems, isolation of individual projects,
quarantine or isolation of animals or other test systems, and routine or specialized housing of
animals or other test systems. 
<DL><DT>(1) In tests with plants or aquatic animals, proper separation of species can be
accomplished
within a room or area by housing them separately in different chambers or aquaria. Separation of
species is unnecessary where the protocol specifies the simultaneous exposure of two or more
species in the same chamber, aquarium, or housing unit. 
<DT>(2) Aquatic toxicity tests for individual projects shall be isolated to the extent necessary to
prevent
cross-contamination of different chemicals used in different tests. </DL>
<DT>(b) A testing facility shall have a number of animal rooms or other test system areas
separate from

Modifies Instructions for Competing and Non-Competing Applications
</H3>

<P>
As part of the design and implementation of Electronic Research
Administration, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is assessing
measures for protecting private information, including the Social
Security Number (SSN), currently collected about personnel identified
in research grant and cooperative agreement applications. Although
the provision of the SSN is voluntary, it is critically important
to NIH for the accurate identification, referral, and review of
applications and for management of NIH grant programs. NIH is
pursuing long-term strategies in this area. Interim measures are
being implemented immediately, however, to further enhance the
protection of this private information. Thus, effective with the
October 1, 1996, submission date, instructions for submitting
competing applications to the NIH are modified as follows:
<P>
1. The Social Security Number (SSN) of the Principal Investigator,
Program Director, or Fellowship applicant should be provided along
with the applicant's name at the top of the Personal Data form
page only (PHS Form 398, page KK, and PHS Form 416-1, page GG).
The SSN should not be listed on the face page of the application,
nor provided elsewhere in the application, e.g., top of each application
page.
<P>
2. In accordance with the instructions for completing the Personal
Data form page, do not attach copies of that form to the duplicated
copies of the application. Upon receipt of the application by
NIH, this form is separated from the application and the data,
including the SSN, are encrypted in the NIH database. A partially
completed Personal Data form page is acceptable to NIH, i.e.,
applicants may elect to provide some items but not all.
<P>
3. When submitting competing renewal applications using the PHS
398 grant application kit, do not complete or submit the Personnel
Report form page (JJ). This form page will be requested, if necessary,
at time of award.
<P>
Effective immediately, instructions for submitting non-competing
applications have also changed as follows:
<P>
1. The Social Security Number of the Principal Investigator, Program
Director, or Fellow should not be provided on the face page of
the application. 2. When using the PHS 2590 kit, the Personnel
Report form page (G) should be completed and submitted only with
the original application. Do not attach copies of that form to
the duplicated copies of the application.
<P>
Similar changes affecting Small Business Innovation Research Grant
and Small Business Technology Transfer Grant application forms
will be implemented for the Fiscal Year 1997 solicitations. Applicants
are strongly encouraged, to the extent possible, to follow the
new procedures for the October 1 and February 15 submission dates.
<P>
INQUIRIES Questions regarding these procedures may be directed
to the Referral Office, Division of Research Grants at 301/435-0715
for issues relating to receipt of competing applications, or to
Institute or Center grants management offices for issues relating
to noncompeting applications.
<H3>Revision to NIH Policy on Receipt Dates for Applications</H3>

<P>
<I>NIH Guide, Volume 25, Number 41, November 29, 1996</I> 
<P>
As a part of ongoing efforts to reduce the administrative costs
and burden on applicants and grantees, the NIH has reviewed its
policy regarding the receipt date of competing applications (PHS
398). In the past, the NIH required that grant, fellowship, and
cooperative agreement applications be received on specific published
&quot;receipt dates.&quot; A consequence of this policy has been
that many applicants felt compelled to submit applications via
express shipping or courier service. To simplify and minimize
the cost associated with application submission, the NIH is making
the following policy change:
<P>
Unsolicited Applications: Effective January 2, 1997, an application
will be considered on time if it is received by or mailed on or
before the published receipt date and a proof of mailing is provided.
Proof of timely mailing consists of one of the following: a legibly
dated U.S. Postal Service postmark; or a dated receipt from a
commercial carrier or the U.S. Postal Service. Private metered
postmarks are not acceptable. The receipt dates for unsolicited
investigator-initiated applications as published in the competing
application kit (PHS 398) remain unchanged. It is hoped that this
will lead to delivery methods that are timely but more economical
in practice.
<P>
Solicited Applications and Proposals: Solicited applications and
proposals continue under the previous policy. Applications must
be received by the specified dates. However, an application received
after the deadline may be acceptable if it carries a legible proof-
of-mailing date assigned by the carrier and the proof-of-mailing
is not later than one week prior to the deadline date. These include
Request for Applications (RFAs); Program Announcements (PAs) with
specified receipt dates, such as Academic Research Enhancement
Awards (AREAs), Small Business Innovation Research applications
(SBIRs), and Small Business Technology Transfer applications (STTRs);
and Request for Proposals (RFPs).
<P>
Noncompeting Applications: This new policy also applies to the
noncompeting continuation application (PHS 2590). The receipt
submission dates identified in the noncompeting continuation application
remain unchanged. Grantees are reminded that noncompeting applications
should be received in time for orderly processing of noncompeting
awards. This is particularly critical during peak workload times
at Institute or Center grants management offices
<P>
This policy announcement supersedes the PHS Grants Policy Statement
(rev. 5/95), section 4-14, and the competing application kit (PHS
398), page 22.

<H3><A NAME="MRI">NSF's Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program
</A></H3>

<P>
<I>(Replaces Instrumentation component of the Academic Research
Infrastructure [ARI] Program)</I> 
<P>
The Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) is designed to
improve the condition of scientific and engineering equipment
and facilities for research and research training in our Nation's
academic institutions. This program seeks to improve the quality
and expand the scope of research and research training in science
and engineering, and to foster the integration of research and
education by providing instrumentation for research-intensive
learning environments.
<P>
The Major Research Instrumentation Program replaces the instrumentation
component of the discontinued Academic Research Infrastructure
Program (ARI).
<P>
Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will
be competing for about $50 million in Fiscal Year 1997. The overall
proposal funding rate for the FY 1996 ARI Program's instrumentation
competition was approximately 43%.
<P>
Proposals will be considered for instrumentation used for any
NSF-supported field of science, mathematics, science education,
and engineering. The research activities using this instrumentation
need not be supported by NSF or the Federal government. The Program
will not provide support for instrumentation to be used in the
conduct of disease-oriented research, including the etiology,
diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental disease, abnormality
or malfunction in human beings or animals, or the design and testing
of drugs for treatment of such conditions since these issues fall
under the purview of the National Institutes of Health.
<P>
The University may submit only two proposals for instrument acquisition
plus a third for instrument development. Anyone interested in
the MRI program must contact Cindy Burroughs for further details
on the institutional review process. The internal deadline for
this program is January 23, 1997. Additional program details and
appellations information can be found at:

<H3><A NAME="SIG"></A>Shared Instrumentation Grant (SIG) Program
of the National Center for Reset Resources (NCR)</H3>

<P>
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Center for Research
Resources (NCR), is continuing its competitive Shared Instrumentation
Grant (SIG) program. The objective of the program is to make available
to institutions with a high concentration of NIH-support biomedical
investigators expensive research instruments which can only be
justified on a shared-use basis and for which meritorious research
projects are described.
<P>
Grants will provide support for state-of-the-art instruments used
in both basic and clinical research with a minimum acquisition
cost of $100,000 per instrument or system. The maximum amount
of support that will be provided is $400,000. Types of instrumentation
may include, but are not limited to: nuclear magnetic resonance
systems, electron microscopes, mass spectrometers, protein sequencer/amino
acid analyzers, x-ray diffractometers, and cell sorters. Support
will not be provided for general purpose equipment or purely instructional
equipment, personal computers, personal work stations, printers
and Ethernet connections. Proposals for &quot;stand alone&quot;
computer systems will only be considered if the instrument is
solely dedicated to the research needs of a broad community of
NIH-supported investigators.
<P>
Since the intent of the program is to promote sharing, a major
user group of three or more investigators must be identified.
A minimum of three major users must be principal investigators
on NIH peer-reviewed research grants at the time of application
and award. The application must show a clear need for the instrumentation
by projects supported by multiple NIH research awards and demonstrate
that these projects will require at least 75% of the total usage
of the instrument.
<P>
An eligible institution (college) may submit more than one application
for different instrumentation. Interested applicants should contact
Cindy Burroughs at 542-5972 (e-mail <A HREF="mailto:sponprog@ovpr.uga.edu">sponprog@ovpr.uga.edu</A>)
for more information about this program and internal deadlines.
The deadline for proposals is <B>March 26, 1997.</B> 
<P>
<I><B>JOINT NIH/NSF SUBMISSION</B></I>: Applications that request
a single instrument with a total purchase cost of more than $500,000
and that normally would be eligible for submission to both the
NIH Shared Instrumentation Grant and the National Science Foundation's
(NSF) Multi-User Biological Instrumentation Program may be submitted
to NIH for joint funding with NSF. The agencies will review such
proposals in a special review group that will be convened by NIH
as a special NIH study section with NSF participation. Under this
arrangement, the agencies may offer joint funding in excess of
the current award limit of $400,000. Applications for joint NIH/NSF
funding will require additional documentation specified by NSF.
Interested applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with
each agency's program representative prior to submitting an application
to determine if the request is appropriate and what documentation
is needed.

[Docket No. 96D-0030]<p>

 <p>

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.<p>

ACTION: Notice.<p>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------  <p> 
SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is publishing a draft  guideline entitled 
``Validation of Analytical Procedures:  Methodology.'' The draft guideline was prepared under the
auspices of  the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements  for
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The draft  guideline provides
recommendations on how to consider various  validation characteristics for each analytical
procedure. The draft  guideline is an extension to the ICH guideline entitled ``Text on  Validation
of Analytical Procedures.''<p>

DATES: Written comments by June 5, 1996.<p>

ADDRESSES: Submit written comments on the draft guideline to the  Dockets Management
Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration,  12420 Parklawn Dr., rm. 1-23, Rockville,
MD 20857. Copies of the draft  guideline are available from the Division of Communications 
Management  (HFD-210), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug  
Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301-594-1012.  An electronic version
of this draft guideline is also available via  Internet by connecting to the CDER file transfer
protocol (FTP) server  (CDVS2.CDER.FDA.GOV).<p>

<p>

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:<p>

    Regarding the guideline: Eric B. Sheinin, Center for Drug  Evaluation and Research
(HFD-830), Food and Drug Administration, 5600  Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857,
301-827-2001.<p>

    Regarding ICH: Janet J. Showalter, Office of Health Affairs (HFY- 20), Food and Drug
Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD  20857, 301-827-0864. <p> 
<p>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In recent years, many important initiatives  have been
undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry  associations to promote international
harmonization of regulatory  requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed to
enhance  harmonization and is committed to seeking scientifically based  harmonized technical
procedures for pharmaceutical development. One of  the goals of harmonization is to identify and
then reduce differences  in technical requirements for drug development among regulatory 
agencies.<p>

    ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite  harmonization initiatives to be
developed with input from both  regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input
from  consumer representatives and others. ICH is concerned with  harmonization of technical 
requirements for the registration of  pharmaceutical products among three regions: The European
Union, Japan,  and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European  Commission, the
European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries  Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health
and Welfare, the Japanese  Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, the Centers for Drug 
Evaluation and Research and Biologics Evaluation and Research, FDA, and  the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America. The ICH  Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation
of documentation, is  provided by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical  Manufacturers
Associations (IFPMA).<p>

    The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of  the ICH sponsors and the
IFPMA, as well as observers from the World  Health Organization, the Canadian Health
Protection Branch, and the  European Free Trade Area.<p>

    At a meeting held on November 29, 1995, the ICH Steering Committee  agreed that a draft
guideline entitled ``Validation of Analytical  Procedures: Methodology'' should be made available
for public comment.  The draft guideline is the product of the Quality Expert Working Group  of
the ICH. Comments about this draft will be considered by FDA and the  Quality Expert Working
Group. Ultimately, FDA intends to adopt the ICH  Steering Committee's final guideline. <p>   

In the Federal Register of March 1, 1995 (60 FR 11260), the agency  published a final guideline
entitled ``Text on Validation of Analytical  Procedures.'' The guideline presents a discussion of the 
characteristics that should be considered during the validation of the  analytical procedures
included as part of registration applications  submitted in Europe, Japan, and the United States.
The guideline  discusses common types of analytical procedures and defines basic  terms, such as
``analytical procedure,'' ``specificity,'' and  ``precision.'' These terms and definitions are meant to
bridge the  differences that often exist between various compendia and regulators  of the
European Union, Japan, and the United States.<p>

    This draft guideline provides guidance and recommendations on how  to consider the various
validation characteristics for each analytical  procedure. In some cases (for example, the
demonstration of  specificity), the overall capabilities of a number of analytical  procedures in
combination may be investigated to ensure the quality of  the drug substance or drug product.  
<p>
 <p> 
In the past, guidelines have generally been issued under  Sec. 10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which 
provides for the use of  guidelines to state procedures or standards of general applicability  that
are not legal requirements but are acceptable to FDA. The agency  is now in the process of 
revising Sec. 10.90(b). Although this draft  guideline does not create or confer any rights for or
on any person and  does not operate to bind FDA, it does represent the agency's current  thinking
on the validation of analytical procedures.<p>
<p>
    Interested persons may, on or before June 5, 1996, submit written  comments on the draft
guideline to the Dockets Management Branch  (address above). Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except  that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified  
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this  document. The draft guideline
and received comments may be seen in the  office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday 
through Friday.     The text of the draft guideline follows: <p> 
<p>

<b>Extension of ICH Text on Validation of Analytical Procedures:  Methodology</b> <p> 
<p>

<b>Introduction</b><p>

<p>

    This document is complementary to the ICH guideline entitled  ``Text on Validation of 
Analytical Procedures,'' which presents a  discussion of the characteristics that should be 
considered during  the validation of analytical procedures. Its purpose is to provide  some 
guidance and recommendations on how to consider the various  validation characteristics for each
analytical procedure. In some  cases, for example, demonstration of specificity, the overall 
capabilities of a number of analytical procedures in combination may  be investigated in order to
ensure the quality of the drug substance  or drug product. In addition, the document provides an
indication of  the data that should be presented in a new drug application.     <p>

All relevant data collected during validation and formulae used  for calculating validation
characteristics should besubmitted and discussed as  appropriate.     <p>
<p>
Approaches other than those set forth in this guideline may be  applicable and acceptable.   It is
the responsibility of the applicant  to choose the validation procedure and protocol most suitable
for  their product. However, it is important to remember that the main  objective of validation of
an analytical procedure is to demonstrate  that the procedure is suitable for its intended purpose.
Due to  their complex nature, analytical procedures for biological and  biotechnological products
in some cases may be approached  differently than in this document.     <p>
<p>
Well-characterized reference materials, with documented purity,  should be used throughout the
validation study. The degree of purity  required depends on the intended use.     <p>
<p>
In accordance with the parent document, and for the sake of  clarity, this document considers the
various validation characteristics in distinct sections. The arrangement of these  sections reflects
the process by which an analytical procedure may  be developed and evaluated.     <p>
<p>
In practice, it is usually possible to design the experimental  work such that the appropriate
validation characteristics can be  considered simultaneously to provide a sound, overall
knowledge of  the capabilities of the analytical procedure, for instance:  Specificity, linearity,
range, accuracy, and precision.<p>

<p>

<b>1. Specificity</b><p>

<p>

    An investigation of specificity should be conducted during the  validation of identification tests,
the determination of impurities,  and the assay. The procedures used to demonstrate specificity
will  depend on the intended objective of the analytical procedure.     <p>
<p>
It is not always possible to demonstrate that an analytical  procedure is specific for a particular
analyte (complete discrimination). In this case, a combination of two or more  analytical
procedures is recommended to achieve the necessary level  of discrimination.<p>

<p>

<i>1.1. Identification</i><p>

<p>

    Suitable identification tests should be able to discriminate  between compounds of closely
related structures which are likely to  be present. The discrimination of a procedure may be
confirmed by  obtaining positive results (perhaps by comparison with a known  reference material)
from samples containing the analyte, coupled  with negative results from samples which do not
contain the analyte.  In addition, the identification test may be applied to materials  structurally
similar to or closely related to the analyte to confirm  that a positive response is not obtained. The
choice of such  potentially interfering materials should be based on sensible  scientific judgment
with a consideration of the interferences that  could occur. <p> 
<p>

<i>1.2. Assay and Impurity Test(s)</i><p>

<p>

    For chromatographic procedures, representative chromatograms  should be used to
demonstrate specificity, and individual components  should be appropriately labeled. Similar
considerations should be  given to other separation techniques.     Critical separations in
chromatography should be investigated at  an appropriate level. For critical separations, specificity
can be  demonstrated by the resolution of the two components which elute  closest to each
other.<p> 
    In cases where a nonspecific assay is used, other supporting  analytical procedures should be
used to demonstrate overall  specificity. For example, where a titration is adopted to assay the
drug substance, the combination of the assay and a suitable test for  impurities can be used.     The
approach is similar for both assay and impurity tests: <p> 
<p>

 <i>1.2.1. Impurities are available</i><p>

<p>


<ul>
  <li>    For the assay, this should involve demonstration of the  discrimination of theanalyte in the
presence of impurities and/or  excipients; practically, this can be done by spiking pure substances 
(drug substance or drug product) with appropriate levels of  impurities and/or excipients and
demonstrating that the assay result  is unaffected by the presence of these materials (by
comparison with  the assay result obtained on unspiked samples).     <p> 
<li>For the impurity test, the discrimination may be  established by spiking drug substance or drug
product with  appropriate levels of impurities and demonstrating the separation of  these
impurities individually and/or from other components in the  sample matrix.  Alternatively, for less
discriminating procedures, it  may be acceptable to demonstrate that these impurities can still be 
determined with appropriate accuracy and precision. <p> 
</ul><p>

<i>1.2.2. Impurities are not available</i><p>

<p>

    If impurity or degradation product standards are unavailable,  specificity may be demonstrated
by comparing the test results of  samples containing impurities or degradation products to a
second  well-characterized procedure, e.g., pharmacopoeial method or other  validated
analyticalprocedure (independent procedure). As  appropriate, this should include samples stored
under relevant  stress conditions: Light, heat, humidity, acid/base hydrolysis, and  oxidation.  <p> 
<p>

<ul>
  <li>For the assay, the two results should be compared.   <br>
  <li>For the impurity tests, the impurity profiles should be  compared. 
</ul>
<p>

Peak purity tests may be useful to show that the analyte chromatographic peak is not attributable
to more than one component  (e.g., diode array, mass spectrometry). <p> 
<p>

<b>2. Linearity</b><p>

<p>

    Linearity should be established across the range (see section 3)  of the analytical procedure.  It
may be demonstrated directly on the  drug substance (by dilution of a standard stock solution)
and/or  separate weighings of synthetic mixtures of the drug product  components, using the
proposed procedure. The latter aspect can be  studied during investigation of the range.<p> 
    Linearity should be established by visual evaluation of a plot  of signals as a function of analyte
concentration or content. If  there is a linear relationship, test results should be evaluated by
appropriate statistical methods, for example, by calculation of a  regression line by the method of
least squares. In some cases, to  obtain linearity between assays and sample concentrations, the
test  data may have to be subjected to a mathematical transformation prior  to the regression
analysis. Data from the regression line itself may  be helpful to provide mathematical estimates of
the degree of  linearity. The correlation coefficient, y-intercept, slope of the  regression line, and
residual sum of squares should be submitted. A  plot of the data should be included. In addition,
an analysis of the  deviation of the actual data points from the regression line may  also be helpful
for evaluating linearity.<p>

    Some analytical procedures such as immunoassays do not  demonstrate linearity after any
transformation. In this case, the  analytical response should be described by an appropriate
function  of the concentration (amount) of an analyte in a sample.     <p>

For the establishment of linearity, a minimum of 5 concentrations is recommended. Other
approaches should be justified.  <p> 
<p>

<b>3. Range</b><p>

<p>

    The specified range is normally derived from linearity studies  and depends on the intended
application of the procedure. It is  established by confirming that the analytical procedure provides
an  acceptable degree of linearity, accuracy, and precision when applied  to samples containing
amounts of analyte within or at the extremes  of the specified range of the analytical procedure.   
<p> 
The following minimum specified ranges should be considered:     <p> 
<p>
<ul>
  <li>For the assay of a drug substance or a finished  product, from 80 to 120 percent of the test
concentration;     
  <li>For the determination of an impurity, from the  quantitation limit (QL) or from 50 percent of
the specification of  each impurity, whichever is greater, to 120 percent of the specification; and 
 <li>For impurities known to be unusually potent or to  produce toxic or unexpected
pharmacological effects, the detection/ quantitation limit should be commensurate with the level at
which  the impurities must be controlled.<p>

    Note: For validation of impurity test procedures carried out  during development, it may be
necessary to consider the range around  a suggested (probable) limit;     <p> 

  <li>If assay and purity are performed together as one test  and only a 100 percent standard is
used, linearity should cover the  range from QL or from 50 percent of the specification of each 
impurity, whichever is greater, to 120 percent of the assay  specification;    <p> 
  <li>For content uniformity, covering a minimum of 70 to 130  percent of the test concentration,
unless a wider more appropriate  range based on the nature of the dosage form (e.g. metered dose 
inhalers) is justified;</li>
  <li>For dissolution testing, +/- 20 percent over the  specified range. For example, if the
specifications for a controlled  released product cover a region from 20 percent, after 1 hour, up
to 90 percent, after 24 hours, the validated range would  be 0-110 percent of the label claim.<p> 
<p>
</ul>
<b>4. Accuracy</b><p>

<p>

    Accuracy should be established across the specified range of the  analytical procedure. <p> 
<p>

<i>4.1. Assay</i><p>

<p>

<i>4.1.1. Drug substance:</i><p>

<p>

    Several methods of determining accuracy are available:    <p> 

(a)  Application of an analytical procedure to an analyte of  known purity (e.g., reference
material); <p>
(b)  Comparison of the results of the proposed analytical  procedure with those of a second
well-characterized procedure, the  accuracy of which is stated and/or defined (independent
procedure,  see section 1.2.);<p>
(c)  Accuracy may be concurrently determined when precision,  linearity, and specificity data are
acquired.<p>
<p>

<i>4.1.2. Drug product:</i><p>

<p>

    Several methods for determining accuracy are available:     <p> 
<p>

(a) Application of the analytical procedure to synthetic  mixtures of the drug product components
to which known quantities of  the drug substance to be analyzed have been added;<p> 
 <p>

(b) In cases where it is impossible to obtain samples of all  drug product components, it may be
acceptable either to add known  quantities of the analyte to the drug product or to compare the
results obtained from a second, well-characterized procedure, the  accuracy of which is stated
and/or defined (independent procedure,  see section 1.2).<p> 
<p>

(c) Accuracy may be concurrently determined when precision,  linearity, and specificity data are
acquired.<p>

<p>

<i>4.2. Impurities (Quantitation)</i><p>

<p>

    Accuracy should be assessed on samples (drug substance/drug  product) spiked with known
amounts of impurities.<p>

    In cases where it is impossible to obtain samples of certain  impurities and/or degradation
products, it is acceptable to compare  results obtained by an independent procedure (see section
1.2.). The  response factor of the drug substance can be used. <p> 
<p>

<i>4.3. Recommended Data</i>:<p>

<p>

    Accuracy should be assessed using a minimum of 9 determinations  over a minimum of 3
concentration levels covering the specified  range (e.g., 3 concentrations/3 replicates each).    <p> 
Accuracy should be reported as percent recovery by the assay of  known added amount of analyte
in the sample or as the difference  between the mean and the accepted true value together with the
confidence intervals.<p>

<p>

<b>5. Precision</b><p>

<p>

    Validation of tests for assay and for quantitative determination  of impurities includes an
investigation of precision.<p>

<p>

<i>5.1. Repeatability</i><p>

<p>

    Repeatability should be assessed using:<p>

    (a) A minimum of 9 determinations covering the specified range  for the procedure (e.g., 3
concentrations/3 replicates each); or     <br>
(b) A minimum of 6 determinations at 100 percent of the test  concentration.<p>

<p>

<i>5.2. Intermediate Precision</i><p>

<p>

    The extent to which intermediate precision should be established  depends on the circumstances
under which the procedure is intended  to be used. The applicant should establish the effects of
random  events on the precision of the analytical procedure. Typical  variations to be studied
include days, analysts, equipment, etc. It  is not necessary to study these effects individually. The
use of an  experimental design (matrix) is encouraged.<p>

<p>

<i>5.3. Reproducibility</i><p>

<p>

    Reproducibility is assessed by means of an interlaboratory  trial. Reproducibility should be
considered in case of the  standardization of an analytical procedure, for instance, for  inclusion of
procedures in pharmacopoeias. These data are not part  of the marketing authorization dossier.
<p> 
<p>

<i>5.4. Recommended Data</i><p>

<p>

    The standard deviation, relative standard deviation (coefficient  of variation), and confidence
interval should be reported for each  type of precision investigated. <p> 
<p>

<b>6. Detection Limit</b><p>

<p>

    Several approaches for determining the detection limit are  possible, depending on whether the
procedure is noninstrumental or  instrumental. Approaches other than those listed below may be
acceptable.<p>

<p>

<i>6.1. Based on Visual Evaluation</i><p>

<p>

    Visual evaluation may be used for non-instrumental methods but  may also be used with
instrumental methods.<p>

    The detection limit is determined by the analysis of samples  with known concentrations of
analyte and by establishing the minimum  level at which the analyte can be reliably detected. <p> 
<p>

<i>6.2. Based on Signal-to-Noise</i><p>

<p>

    This approach can only be applied to analytical procedures which  exhibit baseline noise.
Determination of the signal-to-noise ratio  is performed by comparing measured signals from
samples with known  low concentrations of analyte with those of blank samples and  establishing
the minimum concentration at which the analyte can be  reliably detected. A signal-to-noise ratio
between 3 or 2:1 is  generally acceptable.<p>

<p>

<i>6.3 Based on the Standard Deviation of the Response and the Slope      </i><p> 
<p>

The detection limit (DL) may be expressed as: <p>

<p>

DL = 3.3 <i>(sigma</i>) / S<p>

<p>

where <i>sigma</i> = the standard deviation of the response.<br> 
and S = the slope of the calibration curve.<p>

<p>

The slope S may be estimated from the calibration curve of the  analyte. The estimate of
<i>sigma</i> may be carried out in a variety  of ways, for example: <p> 
<p>

<i>6.3.1. Based on the Standard Deviation of the Blank</i><p> 
<p>

    Measurement of the magnitude of analytical background response  is performed by analyzing
an appropriate number of blank samples and  calculating the standard deviation of these
responses.<p>

<p>

<i>6.3.2. Based on the Calibration Curve</i><p>

<p>

    A specific calibration curve should be studied using samples  containing an analyte in the range
of DL. The residual standard  deviation of a regression line or the standard deviation of y-
intercepts of regression lines may be used as the standard  deviation. <p> 
<p>

<i>6.4. Recommended Data</i><p>

<p>

    The detection limit and the method used for determining the  detection limit should be
presented.<p>

    In cases where an estimated value for the detection limit is  obtained by calculation or
extrapolation, this estimate may  subsequently be validated by the independent analysis of a
suitable  number of samples known to be near or prepared at the detection  limit. <p> 
<p>

<b>7. Quantitation Limit</b><p>

<p>

    Several approaches for determining the quantitation limit are  possible, depending on whether
the procedure is non-instrumental or  instrumental. Approaches other than those listed below may
be acceptable.<p>

<p>

<i>7.1. Based on Visual Evaluation</i><p>

<p>

    Visual evaluation may be used for non-instrumental methods, but  may also be used with
instrumental methods.<p>

    The quantitation limit is generally determined by the analysis  of samples with known
concentrations of analyte and by establishing  the minimum level at which the analyte can be
quantified with  acceptable accuracy and precision.<p>

<p>

<i>7.2. Based on Signal-to-Noise</i><p>

<p>

    This approach can only be applied to analytical procedures which  exhibit baseline noise.
Determination of the signal-to-noise ratio  is performed by comparing measured signals from
samples with known  low concentrations of analyte with those of blank samples and by 
establishing the minimum concentration at which the analyte can be  reliably quantified. A typical
signal-to-noise ratio is 10:1. <p>

<p>

<i>7.3. Based on the Standard Deviation of the Response and the Slope</i>     <p> 
<p>

 The quantitation limit (QL) may be expressed as:<p>

<p>

 QL = 10 (<i>sigma</i>) / S<p>

<p>

where <i>sigma</i> = the standard deviation of the response.<br> 
and S = the slope of the calibration curve.<p>

<p>

The slope S may be estimated from the calibration curve of the  analyte. The estimate of sigma
may be carried out in a variety  of ways, for example: <p> 
<p>

<i>7.3.1. Based on Standard Deviation of the Blank</i><p>

<p>

    Measurement of the magnitude of analytical background response  is performed by analyzing
an appropriate number of blank samples and  calculating the standard deviation of these
responses.<p>

<p>

<i>7.3.2. Based on the Calibration Curve</i><p>

<p>

    A specific calibration curve should be studied using samples,  containing an analyte in the range
of QL. The residual standard  deviation of a regression line or the standard deviation of y-
intercepts of regression lines may be used as the standard  deviation. <p> 
<p>

<i>7.4 Recommended Data</i><p>

<p>

    The quantitation limit and the method used for determining the  quantitation limit should be
presented.<p>

    The limit should be subsequently validated by the analysis of a  suitable number of samples
known to be near or prepared at the  quantitation limit.<p> 
<p>

<b>8. Robustness</b><p>

<p>

    The evaluation of robustness should be considered during the  development phase and depends
on the type of procedure under study.  It should show the reliability of an analysis with respect to
deliberate variations in method parameters.<p>

    If measurements are susceptible to variations in analytical  conditions, the analytical conditions
should be suitably controlled  or a precautionary statement should be included in the procedure.
One consequence of the evaluation of robustness should be that a  series of system suitability
parameters (e.g., resolution test) is  established to ensure that the validity of the analytical
procedure  is maintained whenever used.<p>

Typical variations are:<p>

<p>


<ul>
  <li>Stability of analytical solutions</li>
  <li>Different equipment</li>
  <li>Different analysts</li>
</ul><p>
In the case of liquid chromatography, typical variations are:   <p> 

<ul>
  <li>Influence of variations of pH in a mobile phase    
 <li>Influence of variations in mobile phase composition  
  <li>Different columns (different lots and/or suppliers)    
 <li>Temperature
  <li>Flow rate</li><p>
</ul>
In the case of gas-chromatography, typical variations are: <p> 

<ul>
  <li>Different columns (different lots and/or suppliers)      
<li>Temperature</li>
  <li>Flow rate</li>
</ul>
<p>


<b>9. System Suitability Testing</b><p>
<p>
    System suitability testing is an integral part of many  analytical procedures. The tests are based
on the concept that the  equipment, electronics, analytical operations, and samples to be  analyzed
constitute an integral system that can be evaluated as  such. System suitability test parameters to
be established for a  particular procedure depend on the type of procedure being  validated. See
Pharmacopoeias for additional information.<p>

<P>WRITER: David Hart, (706) 542-8808<BR>
SOURCE: John Avise, (706) 542-1456</P>

<P>    The whole thing started innocently enough. A handful of  research projects on unrelated species in the Southeast --  sparrows, horseshoe crabs, pocket gophers, oysters and bluegills,  for example -- independently turned up the same pattern.</P>

<P>    What all these animals share is a distinct genetic break  between Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions. Most populations weren't  different enough to be considered separate species, but analysis  of the animals' cells revealed that the Atlantic and Gulf Coast  "families" rarely intermixed and probably hadn't done so for  hundreds of thousands or even millions of years.</P>

<P>    So far, UGA genetics research professor John Avise and  graduate students in his lab have detected this pattern in about  two dozen Southeastern species that live in ocean, freshwater and  land environments. Not all the studies started out looking for  this pattern; nonetheless, there it was. </P>

<P>    They had found an answer to a question no one had asked  before. In fact, the data they turned up didn't really fit into  the language of any existing scientific discipline. So Avise and  his students made one up -- or at least coined a term to describe  the field and the subset of evolutionary questions that seemed to  belong to it.</P>

<P>    "It wasn't the case that everybody sat around thinking, 'We  need to have a field called phylogeography. Let's go out and  develop some molecular tools to do it,'" Avise said. "It wasn't  that way at all.</P>

<P>    "Molecular tools came along and provided data of a sort that  had never been available before," said Avise, who has been named  to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National  Academy of Sciences for his work with molecular markers. "This  got people thinking along new lines and led to the development of  this term and this whole field it encompasses, which is a  historical approach to population biology."</P>

<P>    To put it another way, phylogeography is the study of how  geography plays a part in phylogeny, an organism's evolutionary  history. Avise and his students track these geographical changes  by the footprints they leave in the animals' mitochondrial DNA  (mtDNA) -- the DNA in cells' power plants.</P>

<P>    In the case of the Southeastern marine species, for example,  Avise suggests a scene like this: Beginning a couple of million  years ago during the Pleistocene Epoch, advancing and retreating  glaciers changed climates and sea levels, which combined to  isolate the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean populations of  animals.</P>

<P>    That's one possible reading of the story recorded in just a  few molecules. In this new field, not only does the past unfold  in mtDNA studies, but with just a small twist of logic, Avise and  his former graduate students use the same sort of analyses of  mtDNA and other molecules to find ways to protect endangered  species today.</P>

<P> Molecular Conservation</P>

<P></P>

<P>    The phylogeographic patterns detected by Avise and his  students provide glimpses into the heavily debated question of  speciation: When are two organisms different enough to be  separate species?</P>

<P>    It's a hot potato of a technical topic, but it has down-to- earth implications for conservation. Whether a population of  animals is a bona fide separate species or merely a regional  variant affects how that animal is treated by conservation  measures.</P>

<P>    Genetic differences on top of visible physical differences  between organisms may support the naming of a new species. "The  more lines of independent evidence you have, the better chance  you have for declaring a new species," said Trip Lamb, one of  Avise's former graduate students who detected the Gulf-Atlantic  separation in diamondback terrapins. "It's unbelievably  contentious. It shouldn't be, but it is." </P>

<P>    Slight differences in mtDNA also can help unravel the  mystery of how geography affects a species' survival. In fact,  geography may play a much more important role than previously  thought. Current approaches to conservation, such as the U.S.  Endangered Species Act, often focus on one species at a time;  however, considering Florida panthers, green turtles or seaside  sparrows in isolation is probably not the best way to proceed,  Avise said.</P>

<P>    "Genetics can contribute by revealing evolutionary patterns  of organisms, whether they're endangered or not, geographically  across an area," said Avise, whose latest project is a book,  Conservation Genetics: Case Histories from Nature, about genetic  perspectives on conservation. "It's a developing viewpoint that I  think is going to be increasingly widely adopted."</P>

<P>    Many former graduate students from Avise's lab also have  taken molecular analysis into conservation fields. Kim Scribner  looked at similar species of Southeastern mosquito fish which  normally don't mate to form hybrids. He and Avise wondered  whether the species would intermingle if geographic barriers were  eliminated. They experimented in the lab, in natural environments  and even in Biosphere 2. In all three cases, the fish hybridized  in unexpected patterns -- patterns which were reflected in their  genetic makeup.</P>

<P>    "Without the molecular markers, we would not have been able  to do the study at all," Scribner said. "The use of molecular  markers was absolutely critical."</P>

<P>    Now, as project leader in the molecular biology lab for the  National Biological Survey in Anchorage, Alaska, Scribner uses  molecular tools to study waterfowl, fish and marine mammals.  "Basically, almost all the work I'm doing now is involved with  conservation of natural resources," he said.</P>

<P>    Lamb, in addition to finding the genetic break in  diamondback terrapins, also studied hybrids. By using different  tools to examine proteins, in addition to mtDNA, he was able to  distinguish hybrids of two species of tree frogs. Normally, the  two species wouldn't mate in the wild, but because of altered  environments, they had. Molecular markers allowed Lamb to  identify the hybrids, even though they didn't necessarily look  like hybrids and the mating behavior was never witnessed  firsthand. </P>

<P>    Now an assistant professor at East Carolina University, Lamb  has set his sights on the threatened gopher tortoise. He detected  two phylogeographic divisions in that species -- one break at the  Apalachicola River and a smaller break in south Florida. Knowing  these boundaries can help conservation workers decide where to  relocate tortoises that have lost their habitats to human  development, he said.</P>

<P>    While these studies have a regional impact, Avise and Brian  Bowen, another former student, have shown that the secrets in  mtDNA can echo around the world.</P>

<P> Rescuing Sea Turtles</P>

<P></P>

<P>    Because sea turtles start life as tiny hatchlings on  isolated beaches and spend 20 or 30 years in the ocean before  reaching reproductive age, the logistics of sea turtle research  have always been tricky. Early studies of tagged females found  that they returned to the same nesting beaches each year. This  led researchers to suggest that sea turtles "natally home" --  that is, return to the beach where they hatched -- to lay their  eggs.</P>

<P>    The problem was proving it. Molecules came to the rescue.</P>

<P>    Avise and Bowen, now director of the conservation genetics  core at the University of Florida's Biotechnology for Ecological,  Evolutionary and Conservation Sciences lab, realized that mtDNA  held the answer to this question. Mitochondrial DNA has two  properties that make it ideal for studying sea turtle behavior,  as well as phylogeographic patterns. First, it evolves rapidly,  relatively speaking. Second, it is passed along strict maternal  lines. In other words, mtDNA records an organism's maternal  family tree; it is analogous to a female surname. So  straightforward logic allowed Avise and Bowen to address the  question.</P>

<P>    "If it's true that female turtles natally home, almost every  nesting population ought to be genetically distinguishable from  every other one with respect to any genetic traits transmitted  through females, such as mitochondrial DNA," Avise said. "On the  other hand, if female family names are all mixed across nesting  colonies, that would be evidence against natal homing."</P>

<P>    The logic wasn't complicated, but even with molecular  methods, the logistics were a big hurdle.</P>

<P>    "Way back in the Dark Ages of genetics -- the mid-'80s --  you needed fresh tissue for the lab procedures," Bowen said.  That was a problem when they were collecting samples on remote  Costa Rican beaches, 20 miles from the nearest road, and had to  get those samples to the lab in Georgia. "All it needed was the  do-or-die determination that only a graduate student could give  it," he said.</P>

<P>    They solved the problem by collecting lethargic hatchlings  who wouldn't have escaped the nests on their own -- the first of  the 99.9 percent of hatchlings fated never to reach maturity.  (Today, getting to remote beaches is still tough, but the  development of the polymerase chain reaction allows Bowen to use  a single drop of blood as his sample, and collecting live samples  is not an issue.)</P>

<P>    The molecular evidence, when all was said and done, pointed  to natal homing. It turned out that every beach had its own set  of family names -- mtDNA markers -- which typically appeared at  no other beach. Since earning his doctorate, Bowen has continued  his molecular research on sea turtles, with results that could  shake up international conservation efforts.</P>

<P>    Each year between 20,000 and 50,000 loggerhead turtles are  snared in fishing nets in the Mediterranean where they feed; 20  percent to 50 percent of them die. The mtDNA markers gathered by  Bowen and Luc Laurent of France at the feeding sites matched many  of the markers previously collected by Bowen, Avise and others.  The markers showed that 57 percent of the turtles at  Mediterranean feeding sites had originated from nesting beaches  in the Western Atlantic.</P>

<P>    Besides adding further support to the natal homing theory,  these results give the United States a legal hook for protecting  these endangered animals. According to a 1982 United Nations  convention, because the United States provides the necessary  nesting habitat, it has some jurisdiction over protecting  migratory turtles at any stage of the life cycle.</P>

<P>    "What starts out as an esoteric natural history study  provides the foundation for the conservation of animals on the  high seas," Bowen said. His current research is using these same  molecular techniques to ask similar questions, again with a  strong conservation slant.</P>

<P>    For example, Cuba harvests hawksbill turtles from its reefs  for their shells. To avoid conflict with the Convention on the  International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), Cuba assumes a  model in which only turtles nesting on Cuban beaches feed in  Cuban reefs. </P>

<P>    "We think that's hokum," Bowen said. A survey of seven of  the largest Caribbean nesting sites, in collaboration with Dr.  Anna Bass at Louisiana State University, identified genetic  markers for Caribbean turtles, all of which were found in Puerto  Rican feeding sites (since Cuba refused access to its reefs).</P>

<P>    "Population data firmly refute their harvest model," he  said. "They're impacting species from around the Caribbean."  These results were brought up at the recent CITES meeting last  November to force Cuba to halt its turtle harvests. At the  meeting, Cuba backed off from turtle harvesting, and instead  announced an initiative for sea turtle ranching, Bowen said.</P>

<P>    Catching a turtle on the reefs will always be cheaper than  raising one, he added, but "with genetics techniques, it's  possible to tell when non-ranch turtles enter the marketplace."</P>

<P>    Such techniques weren't available even five years ago, but  it's no surprise that Bowen, Avise and others have turned these  methods towards conservation goals.</P>

<P>    "It's always been an underlying theme in my lab," Avise  said, "to retain a cognizance of how whatever we find might  relate to conservation biology, at what I see as a real critical  time in human history, when we're losing biodiversity at an  almost unprecedented pace."</P>

<P> Evolution Revolution</P>

<P></P>

<P>    Which sea turtles feed where, whether they return to the  beaches where they hatched, and other questions of conservation  biology and phylogeography are just some of many applications in  molecular evolution that Avise describes in his recent book  Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution. The book  chronicles how studies of DNA and proteins are revolutionizing  the way scientists view the world.</P>

<P>    In the same way they helped create phylogeography, analyses  of mtDNA and other molecules have formed the basis for the field  of molecular evolution. Do these novel approaches mean  researchers should just toss out all the research since Darwin  and start over?</P>

<P>    "That's what I think we're struggling with as a discipline  right now," Avise said. "We, meaning molecular evolutionary  biologists, should not lose sight of our broader roots, which go  back to natural history studies, ecology, biogeography and a host  of other disciplines that lay the foundation for where we are  today."</P>

<P>    Instead, molecular methods provide new tactics for attacking  old questions. For example, systematics and population genetics  have long staked separate claims to the study of evolution above  and below the species level, respectively. But the division had  always been artificial -- imposed by scientists, not by the  nature of organisms, Avise said. By approaching questions from a  different route, molecular techniques bypass the conventional  wisdom on what can be asked.</P>

<P>    "I think there's a real integration of these disciplines  taking place now and I would argue that that's largely been due  to the leading influence of molecular approaches," Avise said.  "Mitochondrial studies have been particularly influential in that  regard because the nature of the data literally forces you to  think phylogenetically even at the within-species level."</P>

<P>    That just wasn't done before. Molecular methods offer ways  to cross the species boundary seamlessly. In the same way that  Avise and his lab use mtDNA to study an organism's recent  evolutionary history, related molecular methods can uncover  details about the organism's place on the tree of life. </P>

<P>    "The different tools and the genetic systems they're applied  to -- the interaction of those two things -- determine your  window of resolution," Avise said. "Whenever you're dealing with  a particular problem, you have to adjust the focus of your lens."</P>

<P>    Since the 1960s, a slew of methods for focusing on the  genetic innards of plants and animals, including mtDNA analyses,  has been added to the scientific toolbox. It's hardly surprising  that a scientific revolution occurred once scientists began  getting a closer look at the messages encoded in DNA molecules.</P>

<P>    "Indeed, almost all the really insightful molecular  applications involve not just molecular examinations, but  integrating that information in some innovative way with pre- existing information from other sources," Avise said. "And that's  where the real breakthroughs occur.</P>

<P>    "The techniques themselves really precipitated this  revolution, but it has become more than that," he said. "It's  become a revolution in the way people look at evolution, because  we have new windows on the world -- new ways of viewing nature  through molecules." </P>

<CENTER><H2>Drawing on Dreams and Despair</H2></CENTER>

<P> ATHENS, Ga. -- Stefanie Jackson is a contradiction. In person, you see an up-beat
woman with a 500-watt grin. And then you see her art.</P>
<P> Instead of serene landscapes or true-to-life portraits, the UGA art professor tackles deeply
emotional and often troubling subjects -- the generational conflicts in rural Georgia families, the
disheartening deterioration of inner-city urban neighborhoods or the loneliness people mask from
friends, family and the world.</P>
<P> "A lot of times, the public doesn't appreciate my art because they say they get a feeling of
sadness from it," Jackson said. "My biggest challenge is trying to get them to understand that
there are many facets of life, and artists don't have to show only the good side."</P>
<P> Jackson's work in oil paintings, lithographs, drawings and etchings has been described as
introspective, multidimensional and "occasionally sinister." Jackson herself describes her work
as figurative social expression, generally depicting African Americans in urban environments or
places she's lived, such as New Orleans, New York or Detroit.</P>
<P> "My work usually features more than one person, complex images in an environment that
people can somehow relate to," Jackson said. "I like to have a subjective point of view I'm trying
to get across. The viewers may not get the same idea, but that's OK, as long as they see
something deeper."</P>
<P> For example, the "Desolate City" series, her current project, is a range of paintings of
African Americans migrating from the South to the North. In it, Jackson said she will show
young people left stranded in industrial belts because of the lack of jobs to support their dreams.</P>
<P> Jackson started planning the "Desolate City" series more than a year ago. She spent days
driving around Detroit taking photo after photo of empty lots and abandoned buildings in the
neighborhoods where she grew up. She also combed through the old photos in Detroit's Ford
library, looking for visual images that relate to the hopelessness and lack of focus she wants to
portray.</P>
<P> With a grant from the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Foundation, Jackson will travel to
Europe next spring to work as an artist-in-residence in Giverney, France. </P>
<P> "Monet's old stomping grounds," she said. "I'll be able to do research for a series of oils
showing the African-American influence in France, and then the French presence in New
Orleans."</P>
<P> While Jackson says she doesn't always have the images she needs at her beck and call,
her work reflects experiences she's encountered in life combined with scenes from her
imagination, such as New Orleans during the jazz age.</P>
<P> Her lithograph "Dark Madonna of Desire" is a case in point.</P>
<P> "The name is a take-off on `A Streetcar Named Desire,'" she said. "There is a street in
New Orleans called Desire and there's a housing project on it called Desire Projects. I decided to
place a mother trying to raise her child there, looking lovingly at her son in a difficult place.
There's a rat in the background that represents an evil presence threatening the family."</P>
<P> Jackson's work has been shown in many exhibits and galleries around the country, most
recently at the African American Museum in Dallas. She also has received numerous grants and
fellowships, including the prestigious Pollock/Krasner Foundation Grant that is enabling her to
renovate her art studio.</P>
<P> Her work is influenced by Picasso and the Cubist school, with what she calls a sense of
continuity with African-American imagery. Her subject is often the relationship of people to their
environment, reflecting the philosophy that people are born into a certain existence.</P>
<P> In the lithograph "I Cried for You!", for example, Jackson shows a world-weary Billie
Holiday. The title is taken from one of Holiday's songs, and the lyrics, "Now it's your time to
cry over me," are reflected in Holiday's face.</P>
<P> "Billie Holiday had a lot of talent, and she gave so much that I feel a sense of loss that
she had to live such a painful life," Jackson said. "People are faced with certain difficulties they
can't overcome. For my subjects, things are not particularly pleasant, and I show the stress and
heartache of trying to overcome those circumstances.</P>
<P> "I just paint life, and sometimes life is difficult," she said with a smile.

<P>Research involving human subjects must comply with federal and University policies.  This protects researchers as well as participants.  The Human Subjects Office staff oversees all research that uses human subjects as part of the data collection and provides a contact for participants concerned with their rights as subjects.</P>

<P>Regulations from the National Institutes of Health, as well as UGA policies, apply to all research involving human subjects, whether done by students or faculty, and with or without external funding.  Surveys, interviews, educational strategies, questionnaires, and review of medical or other records require prior approval.  The University must report instances of noncompliance to the Office for Protection from Research Risk at the National Institutes of Health.</P>

<P>The University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) is authorized to suspend or terminate any investigation involving human subjects if, in its opinion, the evidence warrants.</P>

<P>The Human Subjects Office is responsible for reviewing all research projects involving human
subjects to assure compliance with both federal regulations of the Office for Protection from Research Risk (OPRR) and the policies of the UGA. These policies apply to all research carried out by students or faculty that involves human subjects, regardless of the funding source. Please note that surveys, interviews, educational strategies, questionnaires, and review of medical or other records require approval.</P>

<P>The Human Subjects Coordinator is supported by the UGA Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB is comprised of ten members and ten alternates, representing various disciplines both on and off campus. Members provide assistance by reviewing proposals to assure that researchers carry out projects safely and considerately. The Human Subjects Office staff also consults and trains investigators to attain compliance, investigates complaints and concerns that relate to human subjects research, and reports significant violations to the OPRR.</P>

<P>For additional information about federal and University compliance, please refer to the Human Subjects Office/Institutional Review Board section under "Federal Laws and Regulations" in Chapter IV of the <A href="../rpph/rph_toc.html">Research Policies & Procedures Handbook</A> or contact the Human Subjects Project Coordinator, Boyd Graduate Studies Research Center, 542-3199.</P>

Following many months of transmitting the entire Deadline Alert
(OFP Deadlines) via electronic mail, viewers may now access the
document via the World Wide Web. The American Association of State
Colleges and Universities (AASCU) Office of Federal Programs (OFP)
provides Sponsored Programs with monthly deadline information
as well as daily synopses of both the <I>Federal Register</I>
and the <I>Commerce Business Daily</I>. The services provided
by OFP are restricted to UGA faculty and staff who may access
the OFP server (<A HREF="http://www.aascu.nche.edu/ofp">http://www.aascu.nche.edu/ofp</A>)
by entering the required password information. <I> </I>Please

<H3><A NAME="ATDC"></A>Funds Available To University Researchers
For Product Development </H3>

<P>
<B>FRCP Conference On December 12th at 2:00 P.M.</B> 
<P>
<I><B>Individuals interested in responding to this RFP are encouraged
to contact <A HREF="mailto:jak@ovpr.uga.edu">Dr. Janice Kimpel</A>
(2-5929) to discuss their projects.</B></I> 
<P>
The Faculty Research Commercialization Program (FRCP) awards up
to $100,000 per project to propel promising technologies from
the conceptual stage to viable full-featured prototypes. All academic
and research faculty of the six Georgia Research Alliance universities
including - Georgia Tech, Georgia State, University of Georgia,
Clark Atlanta, Medical College of Georgia and Emory - are eligible
to apply. If you are involved in research projects that are close
to market or have commercial potential, you are invited to submit
proposals for this innovative product development funding.
<P>
The FRCP provides financial support necessary to move research
technology from the lab to the market. This support, in the form
of a &quot;sponsored project&quot;, can be used for equipment,
materials, contract consulting, release time, etc. Faculty are
encouraged to involve students in these projects whenever possible.
The funds are exempt from university overhead. Business development
support, as provided by Georgia Tech's Advanced Technology Development
Center (ATDC), may be available to sponsored projects.
<P>
ATDC seeks projects that are beyond the concept stage. Only applied
research projects directed at a specific commercial product or
technology with a potential market opportunity will be considered.
The deliverable will be a &quot;prototype&quot; or &quot;near-prototype&quot;
product that should become the basis for establishing a new company
or an opportunity to license the technology. The FRCP has proven
to be an effective model for commercializing applied research.
The following three UGA faculty received FRCP funding during FY
97: Dr. Frank Gherardini (Effective Vaccine For Swine Dysentary);
Dr. Robert Ivarie (PMGI Technology in Avian Transgenesis); and
Dr. Charles Yang (Nonformaldehyde Durable Press Finishing). You
may apply for FRCP funding by submitting a Proposal Preview by
January 15, 1997 and the proposal by March 24, 1997. Both are
mandatory!
<P>

The University of Georgia - Conflicts of Interest Policy

<b>Conflicts of Interest Policy</b>

</font>
<DL>
<DT>
<P><B>1.   Preamble</B></P>

<P>Faculty and staff (hereinafter referred to as "employees") of The University of Georgia
(hereinafter referred to as the "University") understand that their primary responsibility is
to the University.  At the same time, it is recognized that participation in activities of
governmental entities, professional associations, industrial organizations, and other
private institutions may serve the academic interests of the University.  The experience
and enhanced national status that such participation brings are shared indirectly by the
University, and these outside activities often contribute to the richness and diversity of the
academic community.</P>

<P>However, commitment to serve an entity other than the University should be made only
after giving serious consideration to the amount of time and effort that can be given to
other pursuits while satisfying one's primary obligation to the University.  Full-time
employees must commit their full professional efforts to the University.  Part-time
employees owe a proportionate commitment.  Employees of the University must not
engage in any occupation, pursuit, or endeavor that interferes with their obligations to the
University.</P>

<P>Over the past decade, the opportunities for employees to engage in financially rewarding
external professional and entrepreneurial activities have increased markedly.  At the same
time, sensitivity to questions of professional ethics has grown.  Federal agencies have
developed regulations to avoid conflicts of interest in sponsored programs.  If the
University is to enjoy the levels of public support necessary to carry out its mission, all
employees of the University must demonstrate that they subject themselves to high
standards of ethical behavior.</P>

<P>A number of laws, rules, regulations, and policies already address conflicts of interest. 
These laws, rules, regulations, and policies are outlined below.</P>
</DT>
<DL>
<DT>
     <B>1.1  State Law</B>
</DT>
<DL>
<DT>
          <P><B>Sales to Political Subdivision by Officers/Employees</B></P>

          <P>O.C.G.A.  16-10-6 provides that it is a crime, punishable by imprisonment
          for one to five years, for an employee or officer of a political subdivision or
          agency thereof (e.g., the Board of Regents or University) to sell real or
          personal property to certain political subdivisions of the state, including the
          employing political subdivision or an agency thereof.  Exceptions are
          provided for sales of personal property of less than $200.00 per calendar
          quarter, sales of personal property pursuant to sealed competitive bids, and
          sales of real property in which certain disclosures are made.</P>

          <P><B>Transacting Business with the State</B></P>

          <P>O.C.G.A.  45-10-20 through 45-10-28 provide that it is unlawful for a
          state employee to transact business with the agency by which that person is
          employed for himself, on behalf of a business in which the employee or his
          spouse or dependents has a substantial interest, or on behalf of anyone as
          agent, broker, dealer or representative.  Transacting business is defined as
          selling real property, personal property, or services, or purchasing surplus
          real or personal property.  Certain exceptions are provided, and employees
          are required to file annual disclosure statements of business transactions
          with the state.  The annual disclosure forms are provided by the University.</P>

instruction, research, and service activities.  This Policy requires a disclosure of
external interests and activities by employees to be provided with each proposal
submitted to a federal agency, and establishes the University Conflicts of Interest
Committee (UCIC) to review and resolve any potential conflicts.</B></P>

          or reporting of federally-funded instruction, research, or service activities.</P>

          <P>A conflict of interest will arise under the following circumstances:</P>
</DT>
<OL>
<LI>         when an employee, his/her spouse, or his/her dependent children, has
               a Significant Financial Interest that would reasonably appear to be

          involving the general subject of conflicts of interest and the identification
          and management, reduction or elimination of specific conflicts of interest. 
          The UCIC shall be chaired by the Vice President for Research or his/her
          designee, and shall include the Vice President for Services and the Deans. 
          It shall also include not less than five additional appointed members with
          broad representation across the University.  Appointed committee members
          shall serve three-year staggered terms.</P>

          <P>Upon referral from the Department Head/Unit Director/Dean, the UCIC
          shall review all material related to a possible conflict of interest.  If the
          committee identifies a conflict, it will attempt to resolve the matter by
          management, reduction, or elimination of the conflict.</P>

<BR>
The Board of Directors of the Society of Quality Assurance appointed a subcommittee of the
RRC to meet with Dr. David Dull and Ms. Francisca Liem, of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Office of Compliance Monitoring/Laboratory Data Integrity Assurance Division. This
meeting took place on 27 July 1993 at the SQA Headquarters;  its purpose was to discuss issues
with current regulatory relevance.  Agenda items were solicited from RRC members.  The
agenda, as discussed, is presented in its entirety. Responses from Dr. Dull and Ms . Liem are
summarized in italics following the questions posed.  <P>

<B>INTRODUCTION  </B><P>
<BR>
At the outset of the meeting, Dr. Dull announced that EPA  is re-organizing all headquarters
enforcement functions into a single Office within the Agency. Dr. Dull indicated that this
re-organization will have long-term organizational implications for the current structure of the
GLP program, although there are no anticipated changes in the program itself. He stated that the
target date for completion of this re-organization is 1 October 1993 but he seemed skeptical that
it will happen that soon. He said that he hopes to have more information available at the SQA
Meeting in San Francisco in early October.<P>
         
During discussion, the point was raised that at times (during inspections), discrepancies seem to
exist between interpretations made by Headquarters and Regional offices. Dr. Dull indicated that
while it is desirable for the Regional offices to maintain autonomy, when these situations arise,
questions should be submitted in writing to the Policy Divisional. Headquarters will make a
decision on the issue and disseminate appropriate information to the Regional groups.
The written response will eventually become policy and will circulate as an Advisory. For the
EPA, advisories are interpretative guidance of the GLP regulations.<P>

<B>AGENDA<P>

Study Director Instructions to QAU<P></A>

<I>QUESTION 1:</I></B>  What direction can the Study Director give to a QAU at a Sponsor,
Field Management Contractor, or Field Study site regarding the selection and/or timing of
inspections and audits without violating the requirements of QAU separation and
independence?<P>

 <BLOCKQUOTE>In order to assure compliance with the GLP requirement that each study be
inspected at intervals adequate to ensure the integrity of the study, study directors may desire to
recommend that the QAU to perform study inspections at certain times or at certain locations for
specific purposes.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

If such direction is specified in the study protocol and the QAU elects to do the
audits/inspections other than those so specified, does this action constitute a protocol
deviation?<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 1:</B>  It is inappropriate for the study director to give any definite and
directive guidance to the QAU.  The QAU is to be separate and independent of study conduct. 
Matters of information for the QAU should be communicated in the contractual agreement rather
than the protocol but must not be directive. Sponsor direction to the QAU should not appear in
the protocol, either. In cases where the protocol specified phases to be inspected and QA opted to
look at others as well this would be okay as QA is not precluded from looking at other phases.
QA operations should be clearly described in an SOP.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-2">  
<B>Submission of QA Reports<P>

<I>QUESTION 2:</I> </B> Discuss the reasoning of requiring the submission of QA reports
directly to the Study Director rather than concurrently or sequentially via a contracting
laboratory or management firm?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The primary concerns relative to GLP compliance would seem to be the
transmission of information completely, accurately, and in a timely manner to the study
director.<P>

Contract labs and field study management firms are employed by study sponsors to subcontract
and manage the conduct of studies under the direction of the study director. This oversight
includes GLP compliance efforts. If QA reports are sent directly and solely to the study director,
the management firms are not aware of QA findings and/or subsequent corrective actions taken
in a timely manner. In addition, this lack of information could cause conflicts in the management
of studies with both the study director and his designated contractor providing input and
instructions directly to the subcontractors.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I><B>ANSWER 2:</B>  The primary issue here again is the independence of the QA U. The
regulations state that reports are to be sent to the study director. Concurrent submission to both
the contractor and the study director is acceptable. All key parties should be kept informed of
QA activities to ensure proper study conduct and management; it is crucial that QA not be put in
a position where its ability to carry out critical activities is compromised.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-3">  
<B>Third-Party Subcontractor Facility Reports <P>

<I>QUESTION 3:</I></B>  Under what circumstances must a contractor supply a copy of the
study protocol to a third-party subcontractor when confidentiality restrictions are imposed by a
study Sponsor?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is understood that a protocol should be supplied to all laboratories
participating in a study. However, a problem arises when confidentiality restrictions are imposed
by a Sponsor on a contract laboratory when a study is to be subcontracted to other
laboratories.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Further, is the report generated by a third-party subcontractor required to be a stand-alone
document in complete compliance with 40 CFR 160.185?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In the above case, the "objectives and procedures stated in the original
protocol including any changes in the original protocol..." would not be available for the
subcontractor's report and 40 CFR 160.185(a)(2) would not be met.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I><B>ANSWER 3:  </B>It is only necessary to provide that part of the protocol which applies
to the work done by the third-party contractor.  The part of the protocol provided must contain
all the information necessary for proper maintenance of the master schedule; however, it need
not contain all the elements identified in 40 CFR 160.120.<P>
   
Likewise, the partial report from the third-party contractor need not comply with all the GLP
requirements for reports, whereas the overall study report must comply.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-4">  
<B>EPA Procedures in Regulatory Enforcement Actions<P>

<I>QUESTION 4:  </I></B>Are the procedures used in the recent enforcement actions resulting
from Agency inspections typical of the current trend the Agency is taking in these matters?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Specifically, concern has been expressed that a considerable time elapsed
between the inspection and the Agency's enforcement actions and that, based on conversations
with the specific laboratory involved, the impressions which the laboratory held at the
conclusion of the inspection were quite different from the resulting report and actions taken by
the Agency.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
 
<I><B>ANSWER 4:  </B>Dr. Dull summarized the procedures for this in that the conference is
"SOP " but that EPA is not under any obligation to continue this. The Agency wishes to
communicate its findings in a timely manner to the facility inspected.  The close-out conference
will report facts only with no conclusive statements regarding compliance or non-compliance. 
The information passed in the close-out conference is intended to be complete and accurate;
however, the Agency will not be bound by the comments of the inspectors made during the
inspection. No "483 " type of documents will be issued.<P>

The agency is examining a possible change in procedure under which a copy of the inspection
report will be made available as soon as Dr. Dull 's office has approved it. A final decision has
not been made on whether to send out the final report on an interim basis; however, the approved
report, with a cover letter from Dr. Dull, will be sent to the inspected facility. If the facility
chooses to respond to the report, the facility's response will be placed in the file but will not be
further commented on by the Agency. Regardless of what the report says or what was stated at
the close-out conference, the cover letter will contain a disclaimer indicating that the Agency
will not be precluded from some action at some point in the future.<P>
         
When asked why, in cases of violations, some firms receive a letter while others are fined, Dr.
Dull replied that action taken depends on the merits of a case from an evidentiary point of view.
He further discussed the GLP Review Committee (GRC). It consists of representatives from all
offices in the Agency including OCM/LDIAD, Policy, and Enforcement Divisions, NEIC, and
OPPTS. The Regions are represented on the GRC by Region 11.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-5">  
<B>Laboratory Accreditation<P>

QUESTION 5:  </B>Pleases discuss LDIAD's current position and future direction regarding
laboratory accreditation for GLP facilities.<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 5:  </B>Accreditation became an issue because the IG report stated that the
current program was too weak to assure data integrity. Dr. Dull reported that LDIAD 's
involvement was based on the IG report to OCM and a larger Agency-wide effort for analytical
laboratories related to hazardous waste, etc., and that there were no complaints driving the
matter.  He felt that the larger effort was not suitable for GLP compliance purposes. The
Interagency Committee assigned to study the issue consists of members from OCM, OE, OPPTS,
USDA, and FDA and has met three times. There has not been a strong sentiment for
accreditation.  Some industry input has been obtained and all were opposed to the idea. He also
indicated that, with the new Administration and personalities, "all bets were off ' regarding the
future direction of this effort. LDIAD is just puffing together options and does not want to make
any recommendations. Some of the options which he identified as possibilities are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>No action<BR>
<LI>"Full-blown " accreditation, including proficiency testing, for all labs. [Dr. Dull also
labelled this as "unimaginable "!]<BR>
<LI>Accreditation for some subpart of the analytical laboratory industry.<BR>
<LI>Laboratory registration for both contract and in-house laboratories. Certain organizational
information would be required for registration.<P>
</OL>

A paper on this matter is due to be issued within the next few months. Dr. Dull suggested that
the SQA could impact this effort by requesting a meeting with Dr. L. Goldman, the EPA
Assistant Administrator, to present the SQA perspective and by offering comments on the draft
document regarding facts, practical impact, and cost/benefit issues. The time for this has not
been set, although Dr. Dull expects it to be about 6 months. It is not currently expected to be a
high priority issue. In a related matter, Dr. Dull commented that "professional certification " of
individuals is not a current issue.</I><P>

<B>Tank Mix Stability and Homogeneity Requirements<P>

<I>QUESTION 6:  </I></B>Please discuss Policy Branch's position on the resolution of testing
tank mixes for stability and homogeneity.  What are the requirements for characterization and
determination of stability of chemicals, other than test, control, and reference substances, such as
maintenance chemicals which are tank-mixed and applied with the test substance but which will
not be part of the registered product? What about the determination of stability of the mixture in
the carrier?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Under some circumstances it is more efficient and significantly less
expensive to administer maintenance chemicals in a field study by admixing them in the solution
of test substance in the carrier (water). In this example, the use of the additional chemical is not
to be a part of the labelled use of the product but, in commercial use, would normally be applied
in advance of the test substance.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I><B>ANSWER 6:  </B>Dr. Dull stated that the requirements for this are stated in the
regulations and that they will be enforced NEIC and Agency (OCM and OPP) chemists think
that the requirement is not justified scientifically.  EPA GLP Advisory #31 deals with this issue.
He suggested contacting Penny Fenner-Crisp in OPP to submit comments on this. Dr. Dull also
said that he considered maintenance chemicals to be part of the carrier under these
circumstances.</I><P>

<BR><A NAME= dec93-7">  
<B>Multiple Test Substances<P>

<I>QUESTION 7:  </I></B>Discuss possible circumstances in which a study may have more
than one test substance. May the results of such a study be written in a separate final report for
each test substance?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Sponsors may wish to register pesticides separately for use in tank mixes. As
such, it may be more efficient and significantly less expensive to conduct field studies using the
mixed test substances rather than duplicate the experiments for each test
substance.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I><B>ANSWER 7:  </B>Dr. Dull and Ms. Liem indicated that they have not yet seen a study
with more than one test substance. They implied that the wording of the GLP Standards indicates
that there should be only one test substance and only one final report for a study. They suggested
that, in these cases, two studies might be defined which identify the situation in the stated
objective of the study and refer to the presence of the other chemical in the applied material. This
would also then allow for two reports.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-8">  
<B>Test Substance Stability in the Carrier<P>

<I>QUESTION 8:  </I></B>Discuss LDIAD's position regarding the necessity of determining
the stability of a test substance in the carrier for an "acute", single-dose study in which the
solution is administered within hours or even minutes after making the solution?<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 8:  </B>Ms. Liem said that, in her opinion, determination of the stability of
the test substance in the carrier for a single-dose study when the mixture was administered
within a very short period of time after preparation was not necessary; however, no formal policy
has been set. This stability could also be determined in a separate laboratory experiment and then
referred to in the other studies. Homogeneity testing, however, should be done, regardless of
time of solution preparation or dosing.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-9">  
<B>GLP Compliance Statement<P>

<I>QUESTION 9:  </I></B>What is OCM's position regarding the Chemistry Branch rejecting
submitted studies because the phrase "...to the best of our knowledge..." is being used in the GLP
compliance statement on page 3 of the submission?<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 9:  </B>OPP is developing policy to preclude use of these kinds of
statements. Dr. Dull stated that he was "glad to see them doing it". The revision to PR Notice
86-5 will clarify this when it is issued He further stated that, in legal terms, the concept of "strict
liability" applies; i. e., that liability is not dependent on whether the information is known or not
known.  He also pointed out that GLP compliance statements using the wording "based on /a
previously signed statement/. . . " are being rejected.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-10">  
<B>Revisions to the Pesticide Data Registration Requirements<P>

<I>QUESTION 10:  </I></B>What is the status of the revision of the product performance data
requirements (40 CFR Part 158 and Subdivision G of the Pesticide Assessment Guidelines) for
field efficacy studies and the submission of such data to the Agency for registration of new
pesticide products or significant new uses of existing pesticide products?<P>

Discuss Agency plans, if any, to review, update, and revise the current GLPS to customize the
language and/or requirements of the GLPS for field efficacy studies. If field efficacy data is
being generated for the purpose of voluntary submission to the Agency (but under GLP), is
it necessary to report all the data? Is it necessary to report the data at all?<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 10:  </B>A member of Ms. Liem's staff is participating in this revision
process. Revisions are still underway and no dates were given.

There are no plans to revise the GLP Standards for efficacy studies.

There was much discussion on the third point regarding the general applicability of the GLPs in
voluntary submissions.  It was stated that, if all data is not reported, the reasons for this should
be identified.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-11">  
<B>SOP Availability<P>

<I>QUESTION 11:  </I></B>Discuss your position regarding the availability of protocols and
SOPs in electronic form for access by researchers at remotely located parts of an organization. Is
it necessary to have printed, signed copies on file locally?<P>
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>In today's electronic age, access to central computer files is common and an
effective means for accessing widely used documents such as SOPs.  Master copies of SOPs and
protocols would be filed and maintained in read-only central computer files. Researchers
needing to refer to the SOPs could have access to the electronic copy or print their own personal
hardcopy. While signed, dated, and authorized hard copy versions of the documents could be
archived at the central facility, the researchers would have in their possession only unsigned
printouts of the electronic files.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I><B>ANSWER 11:  </B>Dr. Dull suggested that this is an issue where a statement from
Policy & Grants might be helpful. It was pointed out that the regulations state the testing facility
shall have standard operating procedures <B>in writing</B> . . ". He said that he feels that
electronic protocols and SOPs are inevitable but that the regulations as currently written may not
permit them. It was discussed that immediate availability to the researcher and document control
(especially the existence of obsolete copies) are difficult logistical issues with this
procedure.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-12">  
<B>Protocol Deviations<P>

<I>QUESTION 12:  </I></B>Explain LDIAD's current position on requiring that properly
documented protocol deviations need to be included in the formal GLP Compliance Statement as
GLP deviations.  <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>These protocol deviations are typically summarized or itemized and included
in the final report.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>  

<I><B>ANSWER 12:  </B>Dr. Dull and Ms. Liem stated that properly documented protocol
deviations are not considered GLP deviations. They further elaborated that "properly
documented" includes an aspect of timeliness and that all the deviations should not have been
signed or acknowledged by the study director at one time. GLP deviations should only delineate
issues that cannot be resolved Acknowledgement of protocol deviations should reside in the
study file and not specifically with the protocol. He stated that, if something seriously impacting
the study was involved, they would most likely prosecute under some other portion of the GLP
Standard.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-13">  
<B>Normal Agronomic Practices<P>

<I>QUESTION 13:  </I></B>Explain LDIAD's reasoning for the apparent requirement that
"normal agronomic practices" for the maintenance of field plots be conducted in compliance
with the GLPS.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Apparently, plot maintenance operations, such as seed bed preparation,
planting, fertilization, irrigation, and cultivation, which are normal practices for field operations
but not normally specified in the study protocol for field studies and which are expected to have
little or no effect on the study must also be done in compliance with GLPS.<P>

Recently some NEIC officials have been indicating that, in cases where the field principal
investigators are using fields owned by private growers, the growers should be documenting
cultural practices and maintenance chemical applications. This opinion is not consistent within
NEIC. Current practice frequently is that the field principal investigator calls the grower
periodically to receive such information and document it and the source in the study logbook.
Inherent problems of training, maintaining CVs and conducting facility audits at the grower level
cause substantial difficulties in meeting the interpretation of the GLPS.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I><B>ANSWER 13:  </B>Dr. Dull stated that any activity integral to the study or which could
impact the validity of the study should be done in compliance with GLP. He cited the related
example of animal cage preparation. He indicated that it would be adequate for the study director
to make reference to verbal communications in making data entries but that it is safer to identify
this situation in the GLP compliance statement.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-14">  
<B>Contract Facility Inspections by Sponsors<P>

<I>QUESTION 14:  </I></B>With what frequency should facility inspections of contract
facilities be conducted by sponsors or management companies to adequately demonstrate
sufficient oversight and involvement by the sponsor or management company?<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 14:  </B>Dr. Dull stated that this question is "impossible to answer"! The
sponsor should have written policy that articulates why certain decisions are made. They (EPA)
would tend to rely on what the sponsor 's policy is. As an aside, Dr. Dull indicated that he would
like to see the regulations amended to strengthen the sponsor's responsibility.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-15">  
<B>QAU Reporting Relationships<P>

<I>QUESTION 15:  </I></B>What procedures should small companies follow when the QAU
reports to the president of the company who is also functioning as the study director or principal
investigator, in order to meet the requirements for independence from the study personnel?<P>

What is LDIAD's position on whether, under these conditions, the QAU in reporting the
president of the company has become part of the testing facility management?<P>

What is LDIAD's position on whether the QAU can offer suggestions regarding the design or
other scientific aspects of a study to the study director as part of its review of the study protocol?
These suggestions would be then accepted and incorporated into the protocol by the study
director prior to being implemented.<P>

In light of EPA GLP Advisory #52, what is LDIAD's position on whether the members of the
QAU can be a study director when that member is not assigned QAU responsibilities for that
study?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>EPA GLP Advisory #52 states that "Therefore, the members of the quality
assurance unit cannot work on any aspect of the study, even in advisory capacity; cannot be a
study director; cannot be part of testing facility management."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I><B>ANSWER 15:  </B>Dr. Dull stated that this is not what the enforcement procedure is all
about. A disclaimer can be placed in the GLP compliance statement, saying "...we used
laboratory XYZ, which does not have adequate separation of Quality Assurance and
Management". An alternative is to have the QAU report to the sponsor.<P>

In the second issue, he pointed out that the key issue is the maintenance of separation and
independence of the QAU. <P>

On the third question, Dr. Dull said that he has no problem with this. There is no study until after
the study director signs the protocol.<P>

Dr. Dull indicated that this is "an incredibly complicated issue" and common sense must be used.
Again, the key issue is who the study director reports to, and whether the QAU inspects the
study he/she was involved in.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-16">  
<B>Training Records<P>

<I>QUESTION 16:  </I></B>Is it beneficial or necessary that job descriptions contain specific
requirements for minimum education level or experience? Explain the criteria which the Agency
uses to assess the qualifications of QA personnel? What is the minimum with which the Agency
feels comfortable?<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 16:</B>Dr. Dull stated that he felt it was good and reasonable, albeit
difficult, for facilities to set minimal standards but that the Agency cannot require it. Such
situations might be enforced only in egregious circumstances of perceived abuse.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-17">  
<B>Number of Scientific and QA Personnel<P>
        
<I>QUESTION 17:  </I></B>Explain the criteria which the Agency uses to assess whether there
is an adequate number of QA and scientific personnel at a facility; e.g., ratio of QA to scientists,
number of studies per QA, number of studies per scientist?  If the number of studies is used, is
the type and status of the studies also considered?<P>  

<I><B>ANSWER 17:  </B>There is no fixed ratio. Again, such situations might be enforced
only in egregious circumstances or perceived abuse.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-18">  
<B>Study Protocols<P>

<I>QUESTION 18:  </I></B>What is LDIAD's position on whether a facility which performs
only a single aspect of a study receive the entire study protocol?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Soil characterization work may be performed under an SOP but the protocol
only lists the address for shipment of soil samples and not the SOP reference or methods to be
used.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I><B>ANSWER 18:  </B>See the response to Question 3.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-19">  
<B>Equipment Maintenance<P>

<I>QUESTION 19:  </I></B>Describe how most companies are meeting the requirement of
indicating whether equipment maintenance was routine and followed an SOP.<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 19:  </B>Ms. Liem indicated that most companies record this data via signed
and dated entries in an equipment logbook. Some companies have columns labeled as "routine",
"non-routine", and  followed SOP" in the logbook.</I><P>

Other questions were raised during the interview.  These questions and their responses are
summarized below.<P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-20">           
<B>Selective Reporting of Data<P>

<I>QUESTION 20:  </I></B>Is it legitimate to report only selected data from a study; e.g.,
analytical data for a particular level which will not be used for registration?<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The general circumstances were that several treatment rates were used in a
field study but that the submission package would not ask for registration at one or more of the
higher rates. Is it necessary to report the data generated from those treatments during the
study?</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I><B>ANSWER 20:  </B>It is not acceptable to report only selected portions of the
data.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-21">  
<B>Retention of Test Substance Containers<P>

<I>QUESTION 21:  </I></B>Why is it necessary to keep test substance containers, especially
the empty ones?<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 21:  </B>Dr. Dull stated that he felt that this requirement served no purpose.
This requirement could disappear with the next GLP revision. No further elaboration was
given.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-22">  
<B>Laboratory Certification for German Authorities<P>

<I>QUESTION 22:  </I></B>What is the status of negotiations with the German authorities
regarding their requirement for a letter of certification from a national authority?<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 22:  </B>Dr. Dull stated that he has addressed this issue with the German
authorities, noting that the U.S. EPA does not issue such certifications. He is not optimistic that
the Germans will change their procedure. He did state that the EC and the US are negotiating a
position statement that would recognize the US "as a 13th member of the EC". As such, the US
would be exempted from this requirement.</I><P>
<HR>
<BR><A NAME= dec93-23">  
<B>EPA Inspections Outside the United States<P>

<I>QUESTION 23:  </I></B>What inspections is the Agency conducting outside the U.S.?<P>

<I><B>ANSWER 23:  </B>The EPA has MOUs with the Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, and
Germany. Technically, the MOU with the UK has expired, but it will continue to be exercised
anyway. The EC will not allow the institution of new MOUs or renewal of old MOUs. The EPA
has conducted inspections relatively recently in France, Belgium, and in Japan (for
non-toxicological studies).</I><P>
<HR>
<BR>
<B>CONCLUSIONS</B><P>

The SQA/EPA discussion was a very productive and informative one. Both Dr. Dull and the
SQA subcommittee agreed that this type of communication is beneficial and should be continued
on a regular basis. When Dr. Dull was asked what the SQA could do to facilitate his efforts, he
replied that the most important thing we can do is to make an impact on the accreditation issue
by articulating our concerns, especially in the next year.<P>

<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>
</font>
</center>
<center>
<hr size=4 width=600>
</center>
<p>
<STRONG>1. Can applications be sent through e-mail?</STRONG>
<br>
Not at this time.  You are required to submit copies of your application with signatures.  We
provide you with our application and related forms, and you are asked to type out the ten
questions and answers, and to attach any written materials, including consent forms, to be filled
out by research participants.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>2. How long does the approval process take?</STRONG>
<br>
The members of the Institutional Review Board try to approve every application as quickly as
possible, but the process may take from days or weeks to months, depending on individual
projects and personal circumstances.  The Board is not responsible for meeting your deadlines,
only for proper review.  It is the researcher's responsibility to submit proper materials as far in
advance as possible in order to meet those deadlines.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>3. Can I call about my study?</STRONG>
<br>
Yes, you may call the Human Subjects secretary at 542-3199 to learn the status of your
application after you have submitted.  You may learn where your proposal is in the review
process, and if there are any required changes needed before your application will be processed
further.  If you do not hear from the personnel at the Human Subjects Office, it is your
responsibility to learn whether your project is approved before you may start collecting any data.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>4.  Do you help us fill out the application?</STRONG>
<br>
 While the Human Subjects personnel are pleased to give advice, you are responsible for filling
out the application form properly and adding appropriate attachment materials.  We do not
preview your application before it is submitted, because such a preview may be neither accurate
nor efficient.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>5.  So we cannot go over the application with you before we turn it in?</STRONG>
<br>
No.  You are not penalized for incorrect answers on your forms, merely asked to correct them.
</p>
<p>
<STRONG>6.  What about meeting the Chairperson?</STRONG>
<br>
Your IRB chairperson, Dr. Heidi L. Roof,  is glad to meet with you, but we recommend you
make an appointment to ensure that she is available when you stop by.  However, she will not "go
over" your application with you.  All materials should be submitted to the Human Subjects
secretary.

AGENCY:  Food and Drug Administration, HHS.<P>

ACTION:  Proposed rule.<P>

SUMMARY:  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing regulations that would,
under certain circumstances, permit the agency to accept electronic records, electronic
signatures, and handwritten signatures executed to electronic records as generally equivalent to
paper records and handwritten signatures executed on paper.  These proposed regulations would
apply to records when submitted in electronic form that are called for in Title 21 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR).  The use of electronic forms of recordkeeping and submissions to
FDA remains voluntary.  This proposed rule is a followup to the agency's July 21, 1992, advance
notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).  The intended effect of this proposed rule is to permit
use of electronic technologies in a manner that is consistent with FDA's overall mission and that
preserves the integrity of the agency's enforcement activities.  This proposed rule is also intended
to assist in achieving the objectives of the Vice President's National Performance Review.  <P>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:<P>
I.  BACKGROUND</A><P>

In the FEDERAL REGISTER of July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32185), FDA published an ANPRM on
whether the agency should propose regulations that would, under certain circumstances, permit
the agency to accept electronic identification or electronic signatures in place of handwritten
signatures where signatures are required in 21 CFR, and where the electronic form of the
signature bearing record is allowable by the regulations.  The ANPRM requested comments on
current and future electronic records maintained by industry and subject to FDA inspection,
submitted to FDA for review and approval, and FDA's own records and industry notifications. 
The ANPRM also identified and sought specific comment on the following issues: (1) 
Regulatory acceptance; (2)  enforcement integrity; (3)  security; (4)  validation; (5) standards;
and (6)  freedom of information (FOI).  In the FEDERAL REGISTER of October 21, 1992 (57
FR 48008), FDA published an extension of the comment period regarding the ANPRM.
Interested persons were given until December 18, 1992, to comment on the ANPRM.  FDA
received 53 comments from trade associations, pharmaceutical and medical device
manufacturers, computer systems developers, private organizations, a Federal agency, a
university, and consumers.  The comments generally support the ANPRM's objectives.  A
number of the comments made suggestions.  As appropriate, comments will be responded to in
this document in the discussion of the proposed regulation set forth below.<P>

II.  SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS OF COMMENTS TO THE ANPRM</A><P>

A.  Analysis of Comments<P>

The agency received a total of 53 comments to the July 21, 1992, ANPRM.  Comments came
from a variety of sources including:  6 trade associations, 27 pharmaceutical manufacturers, 2
medical device manufacturers, 1 contract laboratory, 8 computer systems developers, 1 law firm
on behalf of a computer systems developer, 1 law firm on behalf of a consortium of industrial
research companies, 1 agency of the Federal Government, 1 drug sample distribution
establishment, one medical center, 1 university food sciences unit, 1 express mail delivery
service, and 2 individuals.<P>
Comments generally supported the agency's efforts relative to electronic signatures and
electronic records.  One comment suggested that FDA's actions may provide a model for other
Federal agencies.  Several comments found the agency's electronic identification issues to be
among the most important and immediate concerns currently facing the pharmaceutical
industry.<P>

One comment expressed concern that the ANPRM did not address medical devices and urged the
agency to adopt uniform agency-wide policies regarding electronic signatures.  In general,
comments addressed the advantages of electronic records in enhancing product quality, control,
production efficiency, and the conduct of nonclinical laboratory studies.   Comments urged the
agency to follow a course of action that would not impede technological innovation.  Comments
also called for expedited resolution of the issues in order to facilitate industry's plans for
implementing new technologies.<P> 

One comment commended the agency for making the February 24, 1992, progress report of the
FDA Electronic Identification/ Signature Working Group available via e-mail and encouraged
FDA to continue electronic distribution of agency documents.  One comment submitted a
58-page paper which addressed legal considerations and a detailed stratification scheme based
upon security risks.<P>

Although the ANPRM stated that the scope of FDA's considerations extends to all articles that it
regulates, and to all portions of 21 CFR under its jurisdiction, very few comments were received
from sources outside the pharmaceutical industry.  One medical device trade association
mistakenly commented that medical devices were not covered.  The agency emphasizes that all
regulated articles are covered.  The agency agrees that it is important to accommodate new
technologies in a responsible manner.  The agency also agrees with the comment that encouraged
FDA to continue electronic distribution of agency documents.  FDA will be implementing this
form of distribution increasingly in the future.<P>

The decision to propose these rules is based upon:  (1)  The information and comments
submitted in response to the July 21, 1992, ANPRM; (2)  the recommendations and findings of
the agency's Task Force on Electronic Identification/Signatures, which was reported in the
progress report of FDA's Electronic Identification/Signature Working Group on February 24,
1992 (Ref. 1); and (3)  the agency's experience with alternatives to conventional handwritten
signatures and electronic records.<P>

The agency is aware that automated systems are being used more extensively in the various
industries that it regulates.  Use of such systems is also expanding within the agency itself. <P>

Implementing paperless electronic records and attendant methods of &quot;signing&quot; such
records is an emerging objective of the use of automation.  Signatures are a key aspect of many
records.  The transition from paper records containing traditional handwritten signatures to
paperless electronic records raises issues relating to FDA's acceptance of alternatives to
handwritten signatures and their underlying trustworthiness.<P>

FDA recognizes the importance of electronic records and their integration into a variety of
automation efforts, such as manufacturing process controls, materials resources controls,
laboratory information systems, clinical trial information systems, and electronic data
interchange activities.  The agency is aware that some new technologies and manufacturing
methods require use of electronic records.  For example, in certain highly controlled
manufacturing environments, the presence of paper itself can pose a source of product
contamination, and (for highly toxic compounds) paper can be a vehicle for exposing workers to
dangerous compounds. FDA is aware of the benefits of conducting official electronic
communication with regulated industries and the public.  However, the agency is also aware that
legal, regulatory, and administrative concerns have delayed full use of electronic
communication.  FDA expects that promulgation of the regulations proposed in this document
will begin to address the agency's concerns and facilitate the agency's modernization efforts.<P>

Although most comments to the ANPRM addressed electronic records within the context of
closed systems, where access is limited to people who are part of the organization that operates
the system, the agency expects that near-term development and implementation of appropriate
controls for open systems, where access extends to people outside of the operating organization,
will facilitate secure, authoritative electronic communication between FDA and the regulated
industries.<P>

The Vice President's Report of the National Performance Review has as a stated objective the
expanded use of new technologies and telecommunications to create an &quot;electronic
government.&quot; (September 7, 1993, Report of the Vice President's National Performance
Review (pp. 113 through 117) (Ref. 2)).  This proposal would be a first step by FDA in
implementing this objective, by, for example, allowing electronic filings of regulatory
documents and expanded use of e-mail.  This will result in significant benefits to the public, the
regulated industry, and the agency.  These benefits could include faster review and approval of
new products, and rapid availability of a variety of agency documents around the clock.<P>

FDA encourages the use of new technologies that will enhance the quality, safety, and efficacy
of products it regulates, but is mindful of the need to maintain the ability to fulfill its consumer
protection mandate.  The agency believes that these proposed rules will accomplish both
objectives.<P>

B.  Comments on Record Types<P> 

The ANPRM requested examples of records that:  (1)  Are maintained by industry and inspected
by FDA, (2)  are submitted to FDA, and (3)  are created and maintained by FDA that may be
amenable to electronic identification/signatures.  Most respondents confined their comments to
the first record type.  However, a few comments provided the following examples of records in
each category:<P>

Records maintained by industry and inspected by FDA that may be in electronic form
include:<BR>
 <OL>
<LI>Master and batch production and control records,<BR>
 <LI>Logs,<BR>
 <LI>Standard operating procedures,<BR>
 <LI>Laboratory notebooks,<BR>
 <LI>Complaint records,<BR>
 <LI>Validation protocols and data summaries,<BR>
 <LI>Laboratory data summaries, and<BR>
 <LI>Drug sample records under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (the PDMA) (Pub. L.
102-353).<P>

Although most comments addressed pharmaceutical records, the agency believes that it is
necessary to recognize that records maintained by industry and inspected by FDA extend to other
articles and include records such as:<BR>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Medical device history records, and medical device master records,<BR>
 <LI>Master record files,<BR>
 <LI>Blood bank donor records,<BR>
 <LI>Thermally processed low-acid foods records, and<BR>
 <LI>Hazard analysis critical control points<P>
Records submitted to FDA that may be in electronic form include:<BR>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>New drug or new animal drug applications,<BR>
 <LI>Product license applications,<BR>
 <LI>Establishment license applications, and<BR>
 <LI>Drug or veterinary drug master files.<P>
Most comments focused on pharmaceutical documents.  However, the agency recognizes that
submissions for other FDA-regulated products would be applicable.  Such records include, but
are not limited to:<BR>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Medical device premarket approval applications,<BR>
 <LI>Medical device premarket notifications, <BR>
 <LI>Medicated feed applications,<BR>
 <LI>Food additive petitions,<BR>
 <LI>Color additive petitions,<BR>
 <LI>Infant formula notifications,<BR>
 <LI>Low acid canned food and acidified food firm, registration and scheduled process filing,
and<BR>
 <LI>Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) petitions. <P>

One comment addressed records maintained by the agency and suggested that signatures
recorded electronically (SRE's), as identified in the ANPRM, should be an acceptable alternative
to signatures recorded on paper.  The comment asserted that SRE's have sufficient uniqueness,
are difficult to forge (especially when accompanied by the date and time the SRE was made),
and would realize legal acceptance.<P>

Two comments suggested that whatever policies are adopted for electronic records maintained
by the industry, or records submitted to the agency, apply equally to FDA's own records. 
Although the proposed rule focuses primarily on records maintained by industries inspected by
FDA, and submissions to the agency, FDA will apply the principles in the new rule to its own
electronic documents.<P>

<A NAME=defi>
III.  DEFINITIONS/STRATIFIED ACCEPTANCE APPROACH</A><P>

A.  Definitions<P>

One comment agreed with FDA's working definitions.  The comment noted that electronic
identification should suffice for all of the agency's applications and called for common codified
definitions for the following words and phrases.<P>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Signature<P>

Several comments agreed with FDA's working definition of the term &quot;signature.&quot; 
One categorized conventional signatures as &quot;wet signatures&quot; and one submission
suggested renaming the term &quot;handwritten signatures&quot; for clarification.<P>
 <LI>Signatures Recorded Electronically<P>

One comment suggested that the term &quot;signatures recorded electronically&quot; be
defined as an electronically captured image of a handwritten signature on optical, magnetic or
other electronic media.  One comment agreed with the working definition.<P>

 <LI>Electronic Signature<P>

Several comments called the working definition of the term &quot;electronic signature&quot; as
acceptable and useful.  However, some comments claimed that the term is imprecise and
potentially confusing to the extent that the word &quot;signature&quot; also appears in other
working definitions.  Several comments suggested the alternative phrases: 
&quot;Biometric/behavioral identification&quot; and &quot;biologically-based electronic
identification.&quot; One comment referred to its security code number assignment system as an
electronic signature, used by physicians to phone in requests for additional drug samples
previously reserved under the physicians' names.  Telephone requests are followed up by
confirmatory signed paper forms.<P>

 <LI>Electronic Identification<P>

Many comments suggested that FDA define only two terms, &quot;signatures&quot; (meaning
conventional handwritten signatures) and &quot;electronic identification&quot; (to encompass
signatures recorded electronically, electronic signatures, and all other forms of electronic
identification). <P>

Comments suggested that definitions should not imply superiority of one type of endorsement
over another and offered the following definition of electronic identification:  &quot;any method
for identifying an individual where the act of providing a personal mark (signing) is recognized
and/or recorded electronically.&quot;<P>

Comments asserted that secure, validated computer systems that use electronic identification
provide better, or at least equivalent, authentication than systems using handwritten signatures. 
One comment suggested that a more precise term would be &quot;administratively controlled
electronic identification.&quot;  One comment said that its digital signature encryption
technology, a system using encrypted &quot;keys&quot; and proprietary algorithms, would meet
the agency's working definition of electronic identification, but could be coupled with hardware
and software that utilize biometric links to meet the definition of electronic signature.<P>

 <LI>Other Definitions<P>

Two comments offered the following additional defined terms:<BR>
&quot;Signature Alternative&quot;--an electronically recorded mark from any type of electronic
identification, not involving a signature recorded electronically, including electronic signature
(biometric/behavioral identification) and, administratively controlled electronic
identification.<P>

&quot;Signing&quot;--the act of providing a personal recorded mark that serves as
identification.  The mark can be, but is not necessarily, provided by handwriting.  The mark may
also be provided by a stamp, seal, or electronic device.  The last example typically records the
mark in magnetic or optical media rather than on paper.<P>

The agency believes that the diversity of comments on definitions reflects the variety of
signature technologies that are available, and the need for a simple codified definition of as few
terms as possible.  The agency is persuaded by the general premise, expressed in many
comments, that FDA should establish only two definitions based broadly on whether or not the
&quot;signature&quot; is handwritten.  Therefore, the agency is proposing to codify two
definitions, one for &quot;handwritten signature&quot; and one for &quot;electronic
signature.&quot;  Electronic signature would include electronic identification; handwritten
signatures would include signatures recorded electronically.<P>

FDA disagrees with the assertion that &quot;electronic identification,&quot; rather than
&quot;electronic signature&quot; should be one of the two broad terms, for several reasons.  The
agency believes the appearance of the word &quot;signature&quot; in both &quot;electronic
signature&quot; and &quot;handwritten signature&quot; will not be confusing to the average
person, especially where the codified definitions are clear.<P>

More importantly, the agency believes that there are overriding advantages to maintaining the
word &quot;signature&quot; in the term &quot;electronic signature.&quot;  The legal,
regulatory, and psychological importance that the average person has come to associate with
conventionally signing a paper document is more likely to be carried over and equally applied to
technological alternatives if the word signature is preserved.  On the other hand, substitution of
the word &quot;identification&quot; for &quot;signature&quot; may, on its face, imply that the
alternative is something quite different and perhaps less significant.  Thus, terminology can help
to establish the functional equivalency of different technologies.<P>

In addition, the term &quot;electronic identification&quot; can be too limiting in scope because
signatures do more than merely identify the person who signed something that could be done by
a person who did not perform the action.  However, retention of the word &quot;signature&quot;
in the term &quot;electronic signature&quot; conveys by direct inference all of the purposes of a
handwritten signature, including identification, authentication, and affirmation.<P>

Accordingly, FDA is proposing in Section 11.3 to define &quot;Handwritten signature&quot; as
the name of an individual, handwritten in script by that individual, executed or adopted with the
present intention to authenticate a writing in a permanent form.  The act of signing with a writing
or marking instrument such as a pen, or stylus is preserved.  However, the scripted name, while
conventionally applied to paper, may also be applied to other devices which capture the written
name.<P>

&quot;Electronic Signature&quot; is defined in proposed Section 11.3 as the entry in the form of
a magnetic impulse or other form of computer data compilation of any symbol or series of
symbols, executed, adopted, or authorized by a person to be the legally binding equivalent of the
person's handwritten signature.<P>

B.  Biometric/Behavioral Links as Part of the Electronic Signature<P>

Systems which utilize biometric/behavioral links as part of the electronic signature verify a
person's identity based on measurement of an individual's physical feature(s) or repeatable
action.<P>

One comment addressed the behavioral link incorporated in a software product designed for use
in pen-based computers; it described how the system provides reliability and trustworthiness by
calibrating and recognizing a set of characteristics attendant to the act of signing (pen strokes,
speed, acceleration, etc.).<P>

One comment provided a paper in support of a signature verification system that characterizes
the act of signing to establish a behavioral link between the signer and the signature, noting the
system's low error rate (0.19 percent false rejects and 0.56 percent false accepts), security, social
acceptance, performance, low cost, and computer portability.  The paper describes how the
system could be used on networks or over phone lines, in conjunction with a
microprocessor-based encryption card, to prevent transmission of a prerecorded (and possibly
false) signature by requiring the generation of a signature for each endorsement.<P>

One submission asserted that stable technologies exist to provide reliable and repeatable
electronic verification of individuals based upon a biometric/behavioral link.  The comment
furnished a report summarizing testing on several such systems that use fingerprints, hand
geometry, the act of signing, retinal scans and voiceprints; the comment cited access control as
the primary type of application for such systems.<P>

Several comments argued against technologies that incorporate biometric/behavioral links on the
grounds of excessive cost; two comments said biometric based devices cost about $1,800 to
$4,000 per unit and behavioral based devices cost $600 to $1,500 each.<P>

Most comments argued against the premise that biometric/behavioral links are necessary or
beneficial to electronic signatures.  However, two comments asserted that appropriate
application of electronic signatures requires a biometric or direct behavioral link to an
individual, and one comment acknowledged that such links are less susceptible to procedural
deviations than other authentication methods.  One comment said biometric/behavioral links are
appropriate to systems which control physical access to a facility.<P>

Many comments urged FDA to refrain from requiring use of systems based on
biometric/behavioral links (particularly where the drug current good manufacturing practice
(CGMP) regulations require signatures) on the grounds that:<P>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Such a requirement would be contrary to the objectives of the CGMP regulations;<BR>
 <LI>Electronic signature systems are not routinely used in non-FDA regulated industry;<BR>
 <LI>Electronic signature technology is relatively immature and unreliable;<BR>
 <LI>The technology is relatively expensive; and<BR>
 <LI>Electronic signature devices are impractical for pharmaceutical applications in which
operators are garbed so as to obscure anatomical interaction with detection devices (e.g., hand or
voiceprints would be difficult to manage where workers wear masks or gloves).  <P>

</OL>
FDA believes it is important to allow firms to take advantage of a variety of new technologies. 
It is not the agency's intent to mandate use of systems that use biometric/behavioral links,
although the agency recognizes the potential advantages of such systems and encourages their
development and adoption.  Comments generally indicate that biometric/behavioral link
technologies have been developed, may have high levels of reliability, but have not yet been
incorporated into manufacturing environments to any appreciable degree.  Accordingly, the
agency's proposed regulations do not, at this time, specify the type of electronic signature
technologies that are required.<P>

However, because FDA recognizes the benefits of those electronic signatures which are
inherently less vulnerable to falsification, and because the agency wishes to encourage the
development of such technologies, the proposed regulations reflect the position that the
robustness of biometric/behavioral based systems permits less stringent administrative controls
to be used.<P>

In addition, FDA considers that biometric/behavioral based systems may have greater
application in open environments, which pose a greater challenge to signature integrity than
closed environments.<P>

C.  Purpose of Signatures<P>

One comment identified the following functions of a signature:  To identify someone; to declare,
to witness, to acknowledge or disclaim, to agree or disagree, and to exhibit responsibility or
authorship, as a formalized personal act such that subsequent disavowal or disclaimer is highly
unlikely.  The comment added that good practice suggests that the signature be properly
ascertained, clearly indicated, and appropriately exhibited in a prominent place, and that bilateral
mechanisms can further this purpose, and focus the individual's attention on the gravity,
solemnity, and formality of the event.  The comment also noted that because the purpose of a
signature is not always apparent, some documents include clarifying phrases such as &quot;in
witness thereof,&quot; or &quot;agreed to by.&quot;  The comment further stated that in the
typical manufacturing environment custom governs the meaning of a signature (e.g., to
acknowledge performance of a procedure, responsibility for proper performance of the
procedure, or to show that the person was merely present).<P>

The agency believes the comment has identified an important aspect of a signed writing, namely
the meaning ascribed to the signature.  Accordingly, the regulations proposed at Section 11.50(b)
require the document being signed to clearly indicate the purpose of the electronic signature. 
FDA also agrees with the comment's view that bilateral mechanisms can help to establish the
seriousness of the electronic endorsement, and the agency is proposing at Section 11.200(a)(1) to
require certain electronic signatures to be composed of at least two elements.<P>

Respondents also commented on how signature alternatives might fulfill the following
traditional purposes of a signature:<P>
<OL>
 <LI>To identify the actor and show his/her authority to act.  Many comments disagreed that
presence of a signature shows the signer's authority to act, noting that such authority is generally
determined by the individual's organization.  However, several comments acknowledged that
electronic identification systems can be programmed to confirm an individual's authority to
act.<P>
One comment said authority to act could be met by the use of identification codes/passwords for
intra-establishment records and by public key encryption standards such as the
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) standard for inter-establishment records.<P>

The agency agrees that the presence of a signature, per se, does not necessarily guarantee that the
signer has the authority indicated.  However, in general, the presence of the signature, in
combination with the signer's title, is by custom a reasonable indication that the person does
have the organization's authority to endorse the subject document.  FDA believes that in most
cases people will not sign a document if they lack the authority called for by the action of
signing.  In the kinds of electronic environments addressed by the comments, systems can check
a cross-referenced authorization roster to see that an individual who attempts to sign a document
has, in fact, the requisite authority.<P>

 <LI>To document the action in a way that is legally binding and cannot be repudiated. 
Comments generally asserted that properly validated and secure electronic identification systems
would be legally binding.  The agency agrees with the comments regarding the importance of
validation and security  and the proposed rule places appropriate emphasis on these controls.<P>

One comment suggested that documentation of the action, not the individual, should be of prime
importance because FDA is concerned more with the actions of a company than with individuals
within a company, and that concern with actions of individuals is the concern of the company
itself.  The comment added that the RSA encryption standard could be used in this area for
inter-establishment electronic records.<P>

FDA disagrees with the premise that FDA should be concerned more with corporate than
individual actions.  In FDA's enforcement activities, there is equal emphasis on the responsibility
of both individuals and corporations.  Furthermore, section 201(e) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(e)) defines a person to include an individual, partnership,
corporation, and association.<P>

 <LI>To create a record that would be admissible in court.<P>

One comment suggested that a record should be admissible in court if it is shown that the record
was generated by the responsible company, regardless of whether or not the record was signed;
the RSA encryption standard was again cited as applicable for inter-establishment records.  One
submission said that electronic records would be admissible when authenticated by appropriate
corporate officials under appropriate procedures relative to electronic identification.<P>
The agency has found that court acceptance of records generally hinges on their reliability and
trustworthiness.  Although FDA agrees that a given unsigned record may be strictly admissible
in a proceeding, establishing reliability and trustworthiness may well require that specific
documents bear signatures of responsible individuals.  In addition, as stated above, it is
frequently important for FDA to establish individual, as well as corporate responsibility in
pursuing regulatory actions, thus making it vital that evidentiary documents are signed by key
individuals.  The weight given to a piece of evidence may also depend upon the presence or
absence of a verifiable signature.<P>

D.  Stratification<P>

The ANPRM suggested that FDA might stratify acceptance of signature alternatives based upon
the regulatory significance of the electronic record.  Comments generally held that regulatory
significance should not be the basis of stratification.  Two comments argued against any
regulatory stratification at all, one asserting that because conventional signatures are accepted in
all situations, any alternative that provides security, identity, legibility and enforceability equal
to or better than a handwritten signature should, likewise, be accepted for any application.<P>

Two comments agreed with the concept of developing a stratified system whereby the regulatory
significance of a record would determine the level of security needed for the signature
alternative, but indicated that companies should individually define the various security
categories and develop appropriate security procedures.<P>

One comment said that electronic authorizations of high importance might require use of
secondary passwords or codes to further augment security and verify data integrity. Although
most comments disagreed with the stratification approach suggested in the ANPRM, many
comments suggested stratification along other lines, as follows:<P>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Open Versus Closed Systems<P>

Many comments suggested that stratification of signature alternatives be limited to security
measures applied to inter versus intra company records.  The distinction was stated in terms of
&quot;closed,&quot; versus &quot;open&quot; environments.  Comments said that closed
systems are typical in the pharmaceutical industry, and include administrative and physical
controls to enhance reliability of the electronic endorsements.<P>

Several comments described a typical CGMP closed system as:  (1)  Having controlled physical
access; (2)  having professionally written and approved procedures with employees and
supervisors trained to follow them; (3)  having records systems designed to facilitate
quality<BR>
assurance investigations when abnormalities may have occurred; and (4)  being under legal
obligation to the organization responsible for operating the system.<P>

The following examples of documents in closed systems were given:  CGMP records, GLP
(good laboratory practice) and GCP (good clinical practice) records including clinical case
reports, such submissions to FDA as new drug applications and adverse experience reports, and
FDA internal records.<P>

Comments generally characterized open systems as:  (1)  Having potentially greater exposure by
outsiders; (2)  entailing communication among multiple parties (e.g., communication by
modem); and (3)  extending system access to people who are not legally obligated to system
managers.<P>

Comments gave examples of open system documents including:  Requests for drug samples,
institutional review board (IRB) reviews of clinical protocols, GLP records, and Freedom of

 <LI>Security Baseline Stratification for Open Systems<BR>
One comment presented a paper which addresses security stratification parameters based upon
the risks of disclosure, where electronic messages are communicated in an &quot;open&quot;
system.  Stratification involves three security baselines, each of which considers the following
message attributes:  (1)  Content sensitivity; (2)  monetary value; (3)  time sensitivity; (4) 
statutory security mandates; and (5)  authentication certification requirements.<P>

Message attributes, under the baseline system, determine the necessity and extent of the
following security and reliability measures:  (1)  Noncryptographic identification and
authentication; (2)  systems controls to ensure authenticity, integrity, and availability; (3)  audit
trails; (4)  message authentication codes (MAC's); (5)  digital signatures/encryption; and (6)
electronic notarization.<P>

Message attributes combined with appropriate security and reliability measures then determine
the electronic document's legal effect:  The degree to which the documents are considered to be
legal signed writings that are authentic and enforceable to the same extent as comparable
documents prepared using conventional paper-based mechanisms.<P>

The agency has carefully considered the divergent comments on acceptance stratification and is
persuaded that the regulatory significance of a document need not be the basis of such
stratification.  However, the comments reflected a general premise that the nature and extent of
security measures necessary to reasonably establish the reliability, authenticity, and
confidentiality of an electronic signed writing will vary to the extent that the writings are
vulnerable to unauthorized alteration or loss.<P>

The agency agrees with comments that a fundamental two tier stratification based upon open and
closed systems, as comments described, is warranted.  FDA anticipates that most electronic
documents which are maintained by industry and inspected by the agency would be considered
as falling within &quot;closed&quot; systems.  Electronic records that are submitted to the
agency, however, as indicated by the comments, may be considered to be within either
&quot;closed&quot; or &quot;open&quot; systems depending on how they are delivered (i.e.,
via &quot;open&quot; e-mail, or &quot;closed&quot; hand-delivery by submitters or postal
services).  Likewise, FDA's own electronic records may be stratified as existing in either open or
closed systems depending on how they are originated and, for certain records, transmitted to
correspondents.<P>
The proposed regulations place primary emphasis on electronic records in closed systems,
because that approach would cover most of the emerging electronic records and would respond
to the most urgent of industry's needs in developing electronic record systems.  FDA considers
&quot;open&quot; systems to be nonetheless important because correspondence and regulatory
submissions conveyed by public electronic networks are gaining wider implementation. 
Therefore, FDA may, in the future, propose more specific requirements relating to open systems,
as the agency gains additional information and experience with open systems and the controls
that may be necessary to maintain the integrity and authenticity of electronic documents in that
environment.<P>

<A NAME=legal>
IV.  LEGAL ACCEPTANCE</A><P>
Several comments said that electronic records would, in fact, be admissible in court, provided
that there are controls in place to make the records reasonably reliable and trustworthy.  One
comment cited several recent court cases in support of this acceptability.<P>
The agency notes that although the ANPRM did not specifically request comments on legal
acceptability of electronic records and signatures, the gist of most of the comments is that legal
acceptance will not be hindered, provided that the records are shown to be reliable and
trustworthy.  The case transcript cited by the comment included testimony from computer system
operators which outlined key good computing practices that many of the comments also
identified.<P>

<A NAME=regul>
V.  REGULATORY ACCEPTANCE</A><P>
A.  General Considerations<P>
One comment suggested that the disparity among FDA regulations regarding acceptance of
signature alternatives was based upon definitions that are either too weak or restrictive, and
called for common regulatory definitions.<P>
The agency believes that any regulatory disparity derives from a number of factors, including the
degree to which various regulations anticipate use of electronic records in place of paper records,
and specific program needs of different FDA centers.  FDA believes that differences can be
dispelled by promulgation of these uniform broad based regulations on electronic
records/signatures.  The agency agrees that common definitions in such regulations would help
to harmonize policy across different parts of FDA.<P>
One comment recommended that FDA issue a broad policy statement or inspectional guideline
that would broadly accept electronic identification/signatures and that would at least establish
criteria for the degree of security required for electronic identification/signature systems. The
comment urged that no new regulations be issued.<P>
The agency has determined that a policy statement, inspectional guide, or other guideline would
be an inappropriate vehicle for accepting electronic signatures because such documents do not
have the same legal significance as substantive regulations that require signatures.  Guidance
documents may be appropriate, however, to elaborate upon acceptance regulations.<P>
B.  Program Areas<P>
<OL>
 <LI>Drug cGMP Regulations<P>
Although the ANPRM applied to all FDA regulations in 21 CFR, most comments focused
primarily on the CGMP regulations for drugs (parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211)).
<P>
Some comments suggested that resolution of the issues in the CGMP context could be applied to
resolve similar issues in the context of other FDA regulations.<P>
Many comments argued that the existing CGMP regulations permit the use of electronic
identification wherever documents are required to be signed, initialed, endorsed or approved,
with the singular exception of Section 211.186 (master production and control records) which
explicitly requires full handwritten signatures.  Comments supported their assertions by citing
preamble comment paragraphs 186, 282, and 447 in the final rule on CGMP's in the FEDERAL
REGISTER of September 29, 1978 (43 FR 45014), FDA's Compliance Policy Guide (CPG)
7132a.08, and (unspecified) tacit acceptance by FDA field investigators who encounter
electronic identification.<P>
One comment identified several sections of the CGMP regulations as requiring signatures,
including Section 211.188(b)(11) (batch production and control records), even though the word
signature, per se, does not appear (&quot;Identification of the persons performing and directly
supervising or checking each significant step in the operation&quot;).<P>
Comments urged the agency to issue a policy statement (such as a CPG), in the near term, that
would condone use of electronic identification for all applications of signatures in the
regulations, except Section 211.186.  Comments requested that in the long term, Section 211.186
be amended to delete reference to handwritten signatures and accept electronic
identification.<P>
The agency does not agree with the assertions that, except for Section 211.186, the CGMP
regulations currently permit alternatives to handwritten signatures or initials.  (See findings of
the Electronic Identification/Signatures Working Group in its February 24, 1992, progress
report.)  The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in consultation with the Office of the
General Counsel, considered and rejected as inappropriate the issuance of a CPG that would
accept &quot;electronic identification&quot; or other signature alternatives, even before the
working group was formed.<P>

The agency's conclusion regarding what the CGMP's allow was conveyed to the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association in a letter of December 5, 1991 (Ref. 3). <P>

Furthermore, the compliance policy guide cited by comments is not directly relevant because it
addresses second check endorsements for operations executed by machine, rather than the form
that human endorsements take.  In addition, although comments cite several paragraphs of the
1978 FEDERAL REGISTER notice as supportive of their assertions, they overlook a key
paragraph in which the agency clearly rejected substitution of employee numbers or codes for
signatures or initials, on the basis of psychological differences from the act of signing and
because of ease of falsification (43 FR 45068, September 29, 1978 (comment 433)).<P>

The agency advises that some sections of the CGMP regulations, while not using the words sign,
signature, or initials, nonetheless implicitly require endorsements to be in the form of
handwritten signatures or initials.  For example, the provisions of Section 211.188 require batch
production and control records to contain the &quot;[i]dentification of the persons performing
and directly supervising or checking each significant step in the operation.&quot;  FDA
investigators have historically encountered and expect to find the identification to take the form
of a signature. <P>

Some developers of automation systems also recognize that &quot;identification&quot; means
&quot;signature.&quot;  Accordingly, the agency is not issuing the suggested CPG, but is,
instead, proposing these acceptance regulations, that would cover records required by most FDA
regulations, including the CGMP regulations.  However, the agency may issue clarifying
guidance documents, as needed, after such regulations are in effect.<P>

 <LI>Regulatory Submissions<P>

Two comments said that regulations that require signatures on new drug applications necessitate
substantial additional handling to furnish paper based signatures where the basic submissions are
in electronic form.  Comments suggested that the agency require submissions to contain, in lieu
of the additional paper, a statement that signatures (handwritten or otherwise) are &quot;on
file.&quot;  The comment added that FDA could verify those endorsements during its
inspections.  The comments observed further that when electronic submissions are copied or
converted among various computer file formats, electronic endorsements might be omitted.<P>

One comment stated that resolution of issues associated with electronic identification and the
transfer or conversion of electronic data will be necessary if the benefits of electronic
submissions are to be achieved.<P>

The agency believes that codified acceptance of electronic signatures in lieu of handwritten
signatures will address the issues relating to regulatory submissions.  Acceptance of electronic
signatures would, in most cases, obviate the need to have paper based handwritten signatures on
file as a reference.  However, the agency notes, from the comments, the importance of having the
electronic records include the printed name of the signer so as to clearly identify the signer.<P>
 <LI>Prescription Drug Marketing Act<P>

Several comments cited the signature requirements (for requesting and receiving samples of
prescription drugs) in the PDMA provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and
based on the increasing use of computer technology to transact the handling of such requests,
urged the agency to accept electronic identification in lieu of handwritten paper based signatures.
<P>

Another comment echoed the same suggestion, recommending that biometric/behavioral links
not be required, but noting also that physician requests for drug samples are generally made in
&quot;open&quot; environments such that use of certain alternatives for full electronic or
handwritten signatures needs review.<P>

One comment requested that, for purposes of the PDMA, FDA accept SRE's based upon their
uniqueness and reliability, and that such acceptance be codified in regulations.  Another
comment described its SRE pen-computer based system, emphasizing the nonalterability of
signed electronic records to merit regulatory acceptance.<P>

One comment assumed that the ANPRM did not pertain to the PDMA.<P>

One comment asked that FDA issue implementing regulations under the PDMA that accept
electronic signatures and that such issuance not be delayed pending the agency's broader
consideration of electronic records and endorsements.<P>

The proposed rule to implement certain parts of the PDMA and the Prescription Drug
Amendments of 1992 was published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of March 14, 1994 (59 FR
11842).  That proposed rule would prohibit the imprinting or automatic reproduction of a
signature by a device or machine such as a stamp, copier, or autopen at 21 CFR 203.61(a).  The
agency recognizes that the PDMA proposal is not in total accord with this general proposed rule
on electronic records and electronic signatures.  As discussed in the preamble to the PDMA
proposed rule (59 FR 11860), FDA will consider the comments concerning electronic signatures
and other signature substitutes received in response to both proposed rules before final rules are
published.<P>

 <LI>Good Laboratory Practices <P>

One comment suggested that a uniform definition of electronic identification would facilitate
application of computer based automated systems in the area of GLP's.<P>
One comment cited the language of 21 CFR 58.130(e) (of the GLP regulations) as calling for
handwritten signatures of paper-based records, but allowing dated electronic identification for
electronic systems. <P>

FDA believes that, here again, broad acceptance regulations should resolve the issues related to
GLP's.<P> 
To return to the top of the entire document, <A HREF=#sigel>click here.</A><P>
<A NAME=accept>
VI.  ACCEPTANCE REGULATIONS</A><P>

Several comments asserted that a general rule with a broad preamble and specific targeted
subsection changes would be the most efficient means of accepting electronic signatures
throughout the applicable regulations.  Other comments also supported new regulations that
would accept electronic identification/signatures throughout existing FDA regulations.<P>

One comment suggested that FDA define the term electronic identification in the CFR in order to
sanction use of those alternatives in place of handwritten signatures.  Another comment said
FDA's codified definition of signature should be clear yet general enough to allow industry the
flexibility to use the most suitable technology.  One comment said the agency should codify the
terms signature, electronic signature, and electronic identification, provide examples of each
term, and determine if there are substantive reasons for requiring handwritten signatures.<P>

One comment suggested that to enhance the move from paper to electronic records, the agency
should develop standards for the generation of portable electronic copies of records, copies that
FDA may need in its enforcement activities.  The comment also suggested that the agency
require that systems be capable of generating such portable copies.<P>

One comment suggested that regulations should consider an electronic record as &quot;signed
and final,&quot; once an operator endorses the record by entering a password.<P>

One comment suggested that FDA's regulations would have to address both electronic integrity
and administrative security.<P>

One comment urged that FDA's final publication resolve several specific issues regarding:  (1) 
Elimination of paper documents when they are converted to electronic form, and distinguishing
originals from copies; (2)  establishing the &quot;legal original&quot; between secure electronic
copies of conventionally signed paper documents; and (3)  whether or not an operation can be
based upon a combination of electronic and paper records.<P>

One comment suggested that, until legal and security issues are resolved, the agency should
accept electronic submissions, encourage development of electronic records systems, but require
supplementary or accompanying handwritten, paper based signatures.  The comment added that
such auxiliary endorsements would parallel the approach taken by the Internal Revenue Service
regarding filing of electronic tax returns (based upon a conventionally signed paper form 8453)
and would be relatively easy to implement=2E  The same comment suggested that once
electronic signatures are proven to be legally viable, FDA should not require them to be
embodied in the electronic documents, but rather incorporated in supplementary documents so as
to facilitate software modification.  (As discussed in section VIII. of this document, one
comment took the opposite view, stressing the importance of having the electronic signature
securely bound to the signed document.)<P>

One submission urged FDA to promulgate regulations regarding use of electronic signatures in
the manufacture of blood components and subsequent testing and transfusion service
laboratories.<P>

FDA agrees with the comments that called for broad regulations that would clearly define the
terms handwritten signature and electronic signature (and do so in a manner that affords industry
the greatest latitude in adopting appropriate technologies), and set conditions under which the
agency would accept alternatives to handwritten signatures.  The proposed regulations apply to
all FDA program areas, including blood components, which are regulated as either drugs or
medical devices.<P>

The agency does not believe it necessary to define the term &quot;electronic
identification&quot; because the general meaning of the term, as suggested by comments, would
be contained in the proposed definition of electronic signature.<P>

The agency agrees that it is vital for FDA to be able to obtain copies of electronic documents and
that systems should have the capability of generating such copies--a provision that is in proposed
Section 11.10(b).  However, the agency does not, at this time, agree that FDA needs to develop
specific performance standards for the &quot;portability&quot; suggested.  FDA may develop
appropriate guidelines in the future to address portability attributes.<P>

Regarding the suggestion that FDA require parallel paper records to bear mandated signatures
pending resolution of legal issues, the agency believes that such a provision need not be codified
because there are no indications that legal acceptance of electronic records/signatures (per se)
remains an issue, where the trustworthiness/reliability of such records/signatures has been
established.  The proposed acceptance regulations address measures to establish such
trustworthiness and reliability.  However, until the regulations are in effect, firms must
supplement electronic records with paper documents for purposes of having required signatures
in conventional form.<P>

The agency does not understand the basis for one comment's concern that electronic signatures
not be required to be contained within the electronic records that are signed.  The key factors in
acceptability of electronic records/signatures have to do with establishing trustworthiness and
reliability rather than facilitating software modification.  Linking the electronic signature with
the electronic document is an important attribute in establishing the authenticity of the
endorsement, just as it is important to &quot;affix&quot; one's handwritten signature to a paper
document.  FDA believes that electronic signatures which are separate from their associated
writings are less reliable and trustworthy than electronic signatures which are incorporated in
their respective documents, to the extent that authors can more easily repudiate the authenticity
of the separated signature.<P>

<A NAME=enforc>
VII.  ENFORCEMENT INTEGRITY</A><P>

Most comments asserted that, based in part upon the provisions of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, use
of signature alternatives should not adversely affect the agency's enforcement integrity. 
Comments asserted that laws against falsification of paper records apply equally to falsification
of electronic records, and that FDA should have no difficulty in affixing individual responsibility
when working with electronic records.<P>

Comments also maintained that electronic record systems must, and can under current
technology, be designed for reliable storage and retrieval, thus meeting industry and FDA audit
needs.  Comments added that electronic record systems can be validated and are at least as
reliable, and more efficient than, paper-based records.<P>

One comment asserted that copies of electronic records containing signature alternatives will be
admissible evidence, in regulatory actions, to demonstrate individual responsibility when FDA
informs the industry that signature alternatives are as binding as conventional signatures.<P>

One comment asserted that within the context of the PDMA, electronic signatures would be
admissible in court when combined with other system controls, such as phoned requests.<P>

The agency recognizes that the ability to collect electronic records that are admissible as
evidence, depends in large measure on whether or not the systems used to generate those records
have been designed for reliable storage and retrieval.  Accordingly, the proposed regulations, at
proposed Section 11.10(c), require that systems that generate and maintain electronic records be
designed so that the records can be reliably stored and retrieved.  The storage/retrieval
requirement should be coupled with the requirement that such systems be capable of generating
accurate electronic copies that can readily be converted to human readable form.  (See remarks
on records &quot;portability&quot; in section VII.)<P>
<A NAME=secur>
VII.  SECURITY</A><P>

Many comments contended that handwritten signatures are not intrinsically secure forms of
identification because falsification can easily be executed unilaterally.  Comments emphasized
furthermore that properly validated and administered identification/password systems, which
lack biometric links to individuals being identified, are more secure than handwritten signatures
to the extent that falsification generally necessitates a bilateral action (i.e., two individuals must
purposefully accomplish falsification).  Comments asserted that security is fundamentally
derived, not from the form of the identification, per se, but rather from the attendant system
controls.<P>

One comment argued against placing too high an emphasis on security and control measures for
signature alternatives, noting that FDA has not instituted corresponding controls for
conventional handwritten signatures on paper records.  The comment elaborated that isolated
forgeries are more apt to go unnoticed than repetitive forgeries of a manual signature, and that
security of habitual signing derives more from the meaning attached to the signing process than
the technical strength of the process itself.  The comment concluded that the effectiveness of
electronic signature alternatives should also derive less from technical security and more from
the meaning attached to the signing process.<P>

The agency finds merit in the comments' premise that the integrity of an electronic signature is
derived more from the systems controls used to generate it than from the technology used to
apply it.  The emphasis on systems controls is justified and reflected in the provisions of the
proposed regulations.  However, FDA recognizes that electronic signatures based upon
biometric/behavioral links can be more secure than others to the extent they are more difficult to
falsify.  Whereas the agency agrees that the meaning attached to the signing process is important,
(e.g., in establishing individual responsibility for an endorsed act such as approving a master
production record), FDA does not agree that the meaning determines the security of the
signing.<P>

Regarding the comment that FDA has not instituted controls for the generation of handwritten
signatures, the agency notes that specific FDA guidance on the matter has not been needed
because conventional paper controls are well established in our culture and because falsification
of paper documents can be readily investigated and documented by a long-standing body of
forensic evidence (e.g., handwriting analysis, ink composition and dating, imprints on stacks of
paper, erasure marks, etc.).  On the other hand, a comparable body of evidence has yet to be
established to pursue falsification of electronic documents and signatures.<P>

The agency finds convincing the argument that electronic signatures based on user identification
codes combined with passwords can be adequately secured in that the signature consists of
multiple parts which require the collaborative efforts of two individuals to execute a falsification. 
FDA wishes to clarify, however, that contemporaneous use of both electronic signature elements
must be executed for each signing.  For example, if a person, having logged onto a system by
entering both a password and a scanned employee badge containing an identification code, need
only scan the badge to execute subsequent electronic signatures, then the safeguard of having
multiple parts to the signature would be lost for those endorsements to the extent that another
person could, unbeknownst to the badge owner, scan the badge and falsify the electronic
signature.  Should the owner carelessly leave the badge unattended, the required collaboration
would be absent.  On the other hand, if an &quot;impersonator&quot; needs to know the badge
owner's secret password in addition to physically possessing the badge in order to execute a
signing, then collaborative efforts would be necessary to falsify the electronic signature; the
badge owner would have to reveal the password to the would-be-imposter, as well as make the
badge available.  Accordingly, proposed Section 11.200(a)(1) requires electronic signatures that
are not based on biometric/behavioral links to employ at least two distinct parts, all of which are
contemporaneously executed at each signing.  In addition, proposed Section 11.200(a)(3)
requires that attempts at signature falsifications necessitate collaboration of at least two
people.<P>

The agency believes that the acceptance regulations need not require at least two distinct
elements where the electronic signature employs a biometric/behavioral link (e.g., retinal scan,
voiceprint) to the signer.  The bilateral security measure would not be necessary in such systems
because only the genuine owner of the electronic signature would be capable of using it.  The
owner could not lose, lend, give away or otherwise transfer the signature in the first place.<P>

One comment expressed the hope that security for alternatives to handwritten signatures will not
result in lesser confidentiality.<P>

FDA agrees that confidentiality of data in electronic records is as important as it is in paper
records.  Systems controls, for both paper and electronic documents, will determine the level of
confidentiality.<P>

One comment stated that signatures recorded electronically, if not somehow inalterably bound to
the electronic document, are insecure to the extent the digitally recorded signature could be
excised and superimposed upon other documents to falsify an endorsement.  Another comment
supported signatures recorded electronically when they are captured to inalterable media, such as
optical disks, provided further, that access to such media is limited, thus reducing chances of
alteration.<P>

The agency agrees that binding an electronic signature to the signed electronic document is a
vital systems control that helps to establish the authenticity of an electronically signed document. 
Accordingly, proposed Section 11.70 includes a &quot;signature to document&quot; binding
provision.  FDA notes that such a binding is usually inherent for handwritten signatures that are
applied to paper documents.<P>

As noted above regarding stratification, many comments made a distinction between the security
needed for signature alternatives affixed to electronic documents contained within the
administrative control of a given firm (closed system) and signature alternatives affixed to
records (such as e-mail and submissions to FDA) that are transmitted from one establishment to
another (open systems).  Comments suggested that open systems require a higher level of
security than closed systems, and that a combination of user identification codes and passwords,
under suitable administrative controls, is sufficient for closed systems.<P>

The agency agrees that because open systems are inherently more vulnerable to message
compromise, additional security measures may be necessary to ensure electronic document
integrity and authenticity.  Such measures may include electronic document encryption and use
of digital signatures.  However, FDA believes that because such measures are still evolving, it
would be premature to specifically require their use in documents submitted electronically to the
agency.  Instead, the proposed rule requires additional security measures, stated in general terms,
that are designed to ensure document integrity, confidentiality, and authentication from point of
creation to point of receipt.<P>

One comment suggested that computer systems used within the CGMP and GLP 
regulations attain the security level of C2 within the Department of Defense Trusted Computer
System Evaluation Criteria (DoD 5200.28--STD), also known as the &quot;Orange Book.&quot;
<P>
One comment concluded that, per the ANPRM working definitions, signatures recorded
electronically (scripted signatures applied to devices other than paper) and conventional
signatures applied to paper offer the greatest security.<P>

FDA does not believe it necessary at this time to codify adherence to a specific security level
that is stated in a standard.  The agency believes that records under CGMP's and GLP's will have
sufficient security when the provisions of the proposed rule are followed.  However, should
additional specific criteria be necessary to attain adequate levels of security, the agency may
consider incorporating specific security standards such as the one suggested.
 
Many comments identified various administrative security controls attendant to the use of (what
the ANPRM called) electronic identification (identification codes (ID)/passwords), and argued
that appropriate use of such controls should make ID/password systems acceptable to FDA for
use in closed systems.  Comments generally emphasized the need to utilize such controls and not
rely upon a single form of signature alternative in isolation.  Suggested controls included the
following:<P>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Establish and follow employee policies which hold people accountable and liable for
actions initiated under their (computer ID) accounts to deter forgery of electronic signatures.
<P>
Comments suggested that employees who violate such policies would be subject to disciplinary
action including termination.<P>
 <LI>Limit computer access to authorized individuals.<BR>
 <LI>Execute carefully written and controlled operational procedures.<BR>
 <LI>Train employees in the use of operational procedures.<BR>
 <LI>Use fully documented production and control procedures.<BR>
 <LI>Validate systems.<BR>
 <LI>Use identity checks; cross-checking to establish that machine readable codes on tokens and
a personal identification number (PIN) are assigned to the same individual.<BR>
 <LI>Use password checks; checking an independently entered password.<BR>
 <LI>Change passwords periodically.<BR>
 <LI>Use authority checks to determine if the identified individual has been authorized (or
trained) to use the system, access, or operational device, or perform the operation at hand.<BR>
 <LI>Use time stamped audit trails to document changes, record all write-to-file operations, and
independently record the date and time of the operator's action or entry.  Concerning audit trail
integrity, comments emphasized the importance of creating back up files to re-create
documentation and deter inappropriate records alterations.<BR>
 <LI>Use operational checks to enforce permitted operational parameters such as functional
sequencing or time.<BR>
 <LI>Use records revision and change control procedures to maintain an electronic audit trail
that documents time-sequenced development and modification of records.<BR>
 <LI>Maintain control over the distribution, access, and usage of documentation required for
various operations.<BR>
 <LI>Encrypt records to provide secure, nonchangeable versions.<BR>
 <LI>Use location (terminal) checks to determine that the physical source of the endorsement is
valid.<BR>
 <LI>Use intentions checks by providing confirming dialog that the signer understands precisely
the intentions of a signature.<BR>
 <LI>Use &quot;time-outs&quot; of under-utilized terminals to prevent their unauthorized use
while<BR>
unattended.<BR>
 <LI>Use security against natural system failures.<BR>
 <LI>Print the individual's name, along with time of &quot;signing,&quot; on the electronic
record to help reenforce the psychological link between the author and the endorsement.<P>

The agency considers that most of the above systems controls have merit and they have been
incorporated in the proposed regulations.<P>

One comment identified the following steps to regulate and control the issuance of tokens, cards,
PIN's, and other machine readable indicia of identity:<P>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Chronological logging of each issuance;<BR>
 <LI>Certifying the identity of each individual;<BR>
 <LI>Noting and controlling the empowerment or authority of issuance;<BR>
 <LI>Testing each token, card, or other indicia to make sure it works;<BR>
 <LI>Keeping each issuance unique;<BR>
 <LI>Assuring that issuances are periodically checked, recalled, or reissued;<BR>
 <LI>Following loss management procedures to electronically de-authorize lost tokens, cards,
etc, and to issue temporary or permanent replacements using suitable, rigorous controls for
substitutes; and,<BR>
 <LI>Using reasonable transactional safeguards to prevent unauthorized use and detect and
emergently report (with unmistakable notoriety) any unauthorized attempts.<P>

The agency agrees that all of the above controls are reasonable and necessary measures to
maintain password integrity.  However, some of these controls may be more amenable to
incorporation in guidelines rather than regulations, and therefore do not appear in the proposed
rule.<P>

In response to the ANPRM's request that comments identify any types of signature alternatives
that would be too insecure to be acceptable, comments cited the use of unilateral methods, such
as a user identification that is readily determined from a publication, or alternatives used in
environments in which employees are motivated to falsify identifications.  One comment
stressed the importance of using bilateral systems, but urged the agency to permit industry to
choose the exact methods (such as use of identification codes combined with passwords or
tokens).<P>

As explained above, the agency agrees that single entity signature alternatives that may be
compromised are not acceptable.  Where bilateral signatures are used, both portions of the
signature should be recorded contemporaneously with each &quot;signing.&quot;  Absent that
duality, FDA would consider the signature to be unilateral and therefore, if capable of being
compromised, unacceptable.  The agency wishes to clarify, however, that single entity signatures
based on biometric/behavioral links that cannot be implemented by people other than their
genuine owners would be acceptable.<P>

<A NAME=valid>
VIII.  VALIDATION</A><P>

Comments generally acknowledged the importance of validating signature alternative systems
and said that there should be no difference between validation of signature alternatives and
validation of other processes or systems.  Most comments claimed that there already exists
sufficient guidance, published by FDA and the industry, thus making it unnecessary for FDA to
publish additional guidance on validation of signature alternatives.<P>

Several comments acknowledged FDA's concerns about the adequacy of computer systems
validation, but indicated that the primary issue concerns what constitutes adequate systems
specifications, a matter comments claimed is still developing.<P>

Comments identified the following elements of signature alternative validation:<BR>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Correct specification;<BR>
 <LI>Correct engineering;<BR>
 <LI>Correct testing;<BR>
 <LI>Correct operation;<BR>
 <LI>System definition:  functional requirements, software requirements, the physical system
and its operating environment;<BR>
 <LI>Assurance of software quality:  structural and functional;<BR>
 <LI>System documentation that is well organized and that includes policies, procedures
and<BR>
master plans defining the philosophy and approach to system validation, and defined meanings
for approval signatures;<BR>
 <LI>Security;<BR>
 <LI>Verification of critical data entries;<BR>
 <LI>Installation, operational, and performance qualification;<BR>
 <LI>Change control and system maintenance;<BR>
 <LI>Employee training;<BR>
 <LI>A records retrieval system that protects records and enables their accurate and efficient
retrieval throughout their retention period; and<BR>
 <LI>Periodic system review and revalidation.<P>

The agency is persuaded by the comments that although validation of electronic signature
systems is important enough to be codified as a general requirement, publication of specifics as
to what constitutes acceptable validation of such systems should be deferred at this time. 
Specific information on electronic signature validation may need to be provided in either future
regulations and/or guidelines.<P>
<A NAME=stand>
IX.  STANDARDS</A><P>

A.  Standards in General<P>

Several comments acknowledged the general utility of standards (e.g., for electronic signatures
which use biometric/behavioral links), but suggested that the issue should be addressed
separately on the basis that standards are not relevant to the forms of electronic identification
anticipated for use in the pharmaceutical industry, and because they are seldom used in
FDA-regulated industries generally.<P>

Several comments said FDA should assess existing standards and provide input into
development of new standards, but should not seek a lead role in their development.  One
comment suggested that FDA collaborate with industry in developing standards should they be
warranted in the future.<P>

Two comments argued that the absence of standards should not inhibit the agency from
accepting electronic identification and that standards would not be necessary where there is an
emphasis on validation, security, and well designed and enforced procedures.<P> 

One comment urged the agency to avoid adopting any single standard or technology for
electronic signatures.  FDA recognizes the benefits of standards and their relevancy to legal and
regulatory acceptance of electronic signatures.  FDA regulations could be simplified by
predicating acceptance of an electronic signature on adherence to one or more appropriate
standards that have been derived from fair evaluation of public comments.  Although industries
regulated by FDA may not have participated in the development of the two emerging primary
digital signature standards, i.e., the National Institute of Standards and Technology Digital
Signature Standard (NIST DSS) or the RSA, either because (in the case of the RSA) the standard
is proprietary, or because the industry did not anticipate their relevancy, the standards may
nonetheless be valuable tools to ensure the authenticity and integrity of electronic records.<P>

In general, the agency agrees with the premise that adherence to specific standards need not be
codified at this time because adequate levels of security may be achieved by adherence to the
controls contained in the proposed rule.  However, the agency may need to address or adopt such
standards in the future, as the industries become more familiar with them and their practical
applications.  The agency anticipates that its role will be that of a proactive participant in
standards development.  Absent the immediate application of such standards, the proposed rule
emphasizes, as comments suggest, system security/integrity controls, and validation.<P>

B.  National Institute of Standards and Technology Digital Signature Standard<P>

One comment suggested, without elaboration, that FDA obtain and consider three cited articles
on digital signature standards.<P>

Many comments cited the controversial nature, per published articles, of the NIST DSS and
suggested that FDA not adopt the standard.  Several comments inferred that FDA should favor
the RSA over the NIST DSS on the basis that RSA is currently the de facto standard for
commercial and some military applications.<P>

One comment urged the agency to adopt a public, rather than proprietary standard, but noted the
difficulty of modifying systems that are essentially completely developed to incorporate the
NIST standard.<P>

One comment encouraged FDA to adopt the NIST draft digital signature standard, on the
grounds that the NIST DSS is a highly secure method of identification that will become
mandatory for Federal agencies where a public-key based digital signature technique is needed
and is to be the single standard for Government communication with the private sector.  The
comment further supported the standard by noting its acceptance by the General Accounting
Office as legal endorsement for Federal obligations.  In addition, the comment asserted the
nonrepudiation property of the NIST DSS.  One comment acknowledged that the NIST standard
offers the benefit, over handwritten signatures, of assuring that the document was not altered
after being signed by the author.<P>

The agency notes that subsequent to the working group's February 1992 progress report, several
criticisms of the NIST DSS, specifically the absence of a &quot;hash algorithm&quot; and
limited size of &quot;keys,&quot; have been addressed.  FDA has also become aware of several
commercial products available to implement the standard, and the agency acknowledges that it
may have direct applicability to FDA electronic communication with the agency's regulated
industries.  However, the standard is not yet finalized, and it has not yet achieved sufficiently
wide utilization, in the agency's opinion, to merit mandatory use, at least in closed systems.  The
standard may have future applicability, though, in open systems, where documents are submitted
to FDA via public electronic carriers, in which case adherence to a limited number of standards
would be desirable to maintain practical communications.  Accordingly, the agency is deferring
a codified reference to the NIST DSS in particular.  However, the agency is proposing in Section
11.30 to use established digital signature standards that are acceptable to FDA, as a system
control that may be warranted to maintain record authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality in
open systems.<P>

<A NAME=freed>
X.  FREEDOM OF INFORMATION</A><P>

Several comments asserted that because matters relating to FOI are not relevant to the
fundamental issues of electronic identification, such issues should be handled separately.
However, comments expressed concern about the reliability of computer methods FDA might
use to delete proprietary information from electronic records released under the FOI Act.  Two
comments said that FDA should realize FOI processing cost savings when records are submitted
electronically if the agency sets guidelines on such submissions.<P>

Comments held diverse opinions about what form (electronic or otherwise) documents released
under FOI should take.  Several comments said FDA should establish standards to avoid having
to copy and purge original records that exist in many different formats.  Some comments said
they would likely provide paper printouts of electronic records requested by FDA field
investigators, and by so doing, the agency would not need to acquire specific software and
hardware to handle proprietary formats.  Likewise, two comments recommended that FDA
respond to FOI requests by providing only paper copies of documents, regardless of the format 
requested.  On the other hand, two comments encouraged the agency to develop systems
whereby requesters could submit FOI requests by e-mail, or directly access an FDA data base to
conduct on-line text searches.  One of the comments suggested that resulting documents from
such searches be mailed to requesters in a manner similar to the procedure used by the National
Library of Medicine's Medline.  The respondent suggested that modest connect time fees would
be appropriate to such systems.<P>

The agency disagrees with the assertion that FOI matters are irrelevant to electronic signature
issues.  When FOI requests are received electronically the agency must ensure that the requests
are authoritative and genuine such that they may be processed and appropriate fees collected.  In
addition, as more firms implement electronic records, the agency will likely collect and store
them electronically in the regular course of its investigational and inspectional activities.  The
consequent move from paper to electronic documents will necessitate use of appropriate purging
technologies, as many of the comments have noted.<P>

FDA finds the comment's suggestions that FOI records be handled strictly as paper documents
inconsistent with the implementation of electronic records systems.  The agency believes the
suggestion that FDA accept FOI requests by e-mail has merit, and it is exploring ways of
implementing the suggestion within the context of electronic submissions in general.  A data
base of all available documents may not be practical at this time considering the scope of
potential documents that may be in the data base.  However, a publicly accessible on-line
electronic data base of FOI-released documents may be in the public interest, and this suggestion
may also be explored.  The agency agrees that it should set technical standards for submission of
electronic documents so as to allow the electronic handling of relevant FOI requests; this
suggestion is also being explored within the context of electronic submissions in general.<P>
<A NAME=prop>
XI.  THE PROPOSED REGULATION FOR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES AND
RECORDS</A><P>

Proposed part 11 is made up of the following subparts:  subpart A--General provisions; subpart
B--Electronic records; and subpart C--Electronic signatures:<P>

A.  General Provisions (Subpart A)<P>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Scope (Section 11.1)<P>
Although most of the comments to the ANPRM represented the pharmaceutical industry, the
agency wishes to emphasize that the proposed rule applies to use of electronic records and
signatures in the context of all FDA program areas and all industries regulated by FDA. 
Accordingly, proposed Section 11.1 states the extent of the regulation's scope to all parts of 21
CFR chapter I. <P>

The agency recognizes, however, that in some instances records required by selected sections of
chapter I may need to be retained in paper form and their associated conventional methods of
signing may need to be preserved.  In such instances, the agency would, by regulation, specify
that electronic versions of those records would not be permitted.  FDA does not anticipate many
such situations, but is providing for them in proposed Section 11.1.  The agency welcomes
comments on any existing FDA regulations that address records where electronic versions of
those records should not be permitted.<P>

Under proposed Section 11.1, absent specific exemption by regulation, records required
throughout chapter I could be created, modified, maintained, or transmitted in electronic form
provided they meet the requirements of proposed part 11.  Likewise, electronic signatures would
be considered to be equivalent to full handwritten signatures, initials, and other general signings
required throughout chapter I provided the electronic signatures and associated electronic
records meet the requirements of the proposed part 11.<P>

 <LI>Implementation (Section 11.2)<P>

The agency recognizes that the pace and extent of converting from paper to electronic records
will vary significantly in industry and, in fact, within FDA itself.  Adoption of electronic records
technologies generally depends upon a number of factors, including systems availability, costs,
integration into existing paper based records systems, and the need to train employees in
developing and maintaining electronic systems.  In order to implement the new rule in a fair and
practical manner, the agency is dividing the types of records to be covered into two broad
categories, namely records required by regulation to be maintained but not submitted to FDA
(such as batch production records), and records submitted to FDA (such as food additive
petitions and comments to proposed rules).<P>

This approach is being taken for two reasons.  First, the agency believes it is important to enable
regulated industries to implement electronic records/signatures for records that are required by
regulation to be maintained, but not submitted to the agency, as rapidly as possible.   Some firms
have already taken major steps toward implementing electronic production records and the
agency does not wish to delay the appropriate adoption of new technologies.<P> 

Second, FDA is not yet prepared to accept and manage all submissions in electronic form. 
However, FDA believes it vital to enable those agency units that are prepared to receive and
manage submissions in electronic form to do so as rapidly as practical.  There are many different
types of submissions to the agency.  (A July 1991 FDA report entitled, &quot;Basic Inventory of
Submissions to the FDA,&quot; (Office of Planning and Evaluation) identified 87 different types
of submissions (Ref. 4)).   The agency is reviewing all of the various submissions to identify
which documents it can accept and manage in electronic form (in whole or in part), and the
corresponding capabilities of the receiving agency units.  The agency is committed to accepting
as many submissions in electronic form as possible, consistent with available resources, but
realizes that the goal of accepting all submissions in electronic form will be achieved in phases
over a period of time.<P>

The agency intends to publish a public docket on electronic submissions (docket number to be
announced).  The docket would identify those submissions that may be made (in whole or in
part) in electronic form, and the corresponding agency receiving units.  Receiving units may also
publish appropriate technical guidance documents on how submissions are to be made relative to
the units' capabilities.  In addition, FDA encourages submitters to work with the agency to
develop appropriate pilot programs to implement electronic submissions that may be more
complex in nature.  The agency is committed to the goal of eventually accepting most
submissions in electronic form because it recognizes the attendant benefits of using electronic
records, benefits such as speedier document review times, cost savings in not having to store and
manage paper, and the improved responsiveness to the general public and regulated industries
that generally derives from electronic systems.<P>

Therefore, proposed Section 11.2(a) enables persons to use electronic records/signatures in lieu
of paper records/conventional signatures, in whole or in part, for records which are required by
FDA regulation to be maintained, but not submitted to FDA.  Proposed Section 11.2(b) enables
persons to use electronic records/signatures in lieu of paper records/conventional signatures, in
whole or in part, for records that are submitted to FDA, provided the type of submission has been
identified in public docket (docket number to be announced) as one which FDA accepts in
electronic form.  The agency intends to announce changes to the public docket, on a periodic
basis, by a variety of means.  For example, a notice announcing changes may be published in the
FEDERAL REGISTER.<P>

FDA wishes to clarify that the requirements in proposed part 11 would apply to both types of
electronic records (submissions FDA accepts in electronic form and records required by
regulation to be maintained) unless, as stated above, a regulation specifically prohibits the record
from being in electronic form.<P>

 <LI>Definitions (Section 11.3)<P>

Proposed Section 11.3 sets forth definitions of key terms, including &quot;biometric/behavioral
links,&quot; &quot;closed system,&quot; &quot;open system,&quot; &quot;electronic
record,&quot; &quot;electronic signature,&quot; and &quot;handwritten signature.&quot;  A
&quot;biometric/behavioral link&quot; (proposed Section 11.3(b)(3)) is a method of verifying a
person's identity based on measurement of the person's physical feature(s) or repeatable action.
<P>

The agency believes that biometric/behavioral links would be utilized in technologies that use,
for example, voiceprints, handprints, and retinal scans to identify individuals.  A system that
characterizes the act of signing one's name, as a function of unique behavior (parameters of
physical signing such as speed of stylus movement, pressure, pauses, etc.) is another example.  A
fundamental premise of biometric/behavioral link technologies is that the resulting electronic
signatures are inherently unique to an individual and cannot, by ordinary means, be falsified.<P>

A &quot;closed system&quot; (proposed Section 11.3(b)(4)) is an environment in which there is
communication among multiple persons, where system access is restricted to people who are part
of the organization that operates the system.  FDA believes that electronic documents within a
closed system are less likely to be compromised than those in an &quot;open system&quot;
because they are not as vulnerable to disclosure to, and corruption by, unintended outsiders to
the organization.  Where a firm hand delivers to FDA a magnetic disk containing an electronic
document, the agency would consider such communication to have been made in a closed
system.<P>

An &quot;open system&quot; (proposed Section 11.3(b)(8)) is an environment in which there is
communication among multiple persons, where system access extends to people who are not part
of the organization that operates the system.  FDA believes electronic documents in open
systems merit additional protection from unauthorized disclosure and corruption.  Where a firm
sends FDA an electronic document by electronic mail, the agency would consider such
submission to have been made in an open system.<P>

An &quot;electronic record&quot; (proposed Section 11.3(b)(5)) is a document or writing
comprised of any combination of text, graphic representation, data, audio information, or video
information, that is created, modified, maintained, or transmitted in digital form by a computer
or related system.  The agency is proposing a broadly based definition of this term in order to
accommodate digital technologies that may incorporate pictures and sound, in addition to text
and data.<P>

Although, as discussed above, the ANPRM discussed four possible terms relating to different
kinds of signatures, FDA is proposing two definitions based broadly on whether or not the
&quot;signature&quot; is handwritten.  Two definitions are proposed, one for &quot;electronic
signature&quot; (Section 11.3(b)(6)) and one for &quot;handwritten signature&quot; (Section
11.3(b)(7)).  The term electronic signature would include the meaning comments ascribed to
electronic identification.  Handwritten signatures would include signatures recorded
electronically.<P>

Proposed Section 11.3(b)(6) defines the term &quot;electronic signature&quot; as the entry in
the form of a magnetic impulse or other form of computer data compilation of any symbol or
series of symbols executed, adopted, or authorized by a person to be the legally binding
equivalent of the person's handwritten signature.  The fundamental premise is that an electronic
signature is some combination of what a person possesses (such as an identification card), knows
(such as a secret password), or is (the unique characteristic embodied in a biometric/behavioral
link such as a voiceprint).<P>

Proposed Section 11.3(b)(7) defines the term &quot;handwritten signature&quot; as the name of
an individual, handwritten in script by that individual, executed or adopted with the present
intention to authenticate a writing in a permanent form.  An important aspect of a handwritten
signature is that the act of signing with a writing or marking instrument such as a pen, or stylus is
preserved. <P>

The agency is aware of electronic records systems which capture the image of a signature as a
person applies a handwritten signature to a &quot;screen&quot; or sensing device.  Because the
traditional action of signing is preserved, the agency regards such a signature to be a handwritten
signature even though it is written to an electronic document.  The proposed definition includes
wording to clarify this intent.<P>

B.  Electronic Records (Subpart B)<P>

As discussed above, the agency has accepted the comments on the ANPRM that suggested that
adequate system controls should be the basis for establishing the regulatory and legal acceptance
of electronic records.  The agency appreciates the extent of the suggested controls which are
intended to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of electronic records and to
ensure that signers cannot readily repudiate the electronic records as not genuine. <P>

FDA has incorporated most of the controls in the proposed regulations.  Controls not adopted at
this time may be incorporated in subsequent revisions to these regulations, or addressed in
agency guidelines.  In addition, FDA accepts the premise that some stratification of those
controls should be codified based upon whether the electronic records are within closed or open
systems.  Therefore, this subpart includes separate controls for records in closed and open
systems.<P>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>Controls for Closed Systems (Section 11.10)<P>

Proposed Section 11.10 includes a general requirement that there be procedures and controls
designed to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of electronic records, and to
ensure that the signer cannot readily repudiate the signed record as not genuine.  In addition, the
agency is proposing 11 specific controls. <P>

FDA wishes to emphasize that the proposed list of system controls is not intended to be all
inclusive of what may be needed for a given electronic records system, and that some controls
may not be necessary in all types of systems.  The wording of the proposal is intended to clarify
which controls are generally applicable and which are germane to certain types of systems
depending upon their intended use.  For example, operational checks to enforce permitted
sequencing of events would not be appropriate to systems in which proper sequencing was not
relevant to the events being recorded.  Examples of system controls that would be applicable in
all cases include validation and protection of records to ensure that records remain accurate and
retrievable throughout their retention period.<P>

Some of the proposed system controls (e.g., inspection and copying of records) are necessary to
ensure that the agency can fulfill its enforcement responsibilities.  The subject of enforcement
integrity was extensively addressed in the ANPRM and by comments, most of whom asserted
that properly validated and secured systems should not hamper the agency's enforcement
activities.<P>

As discussed above, many ANPRM comments asserted that enforcement integrity would not be
hampered because, under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, falsification of electronic records would be
equivalent to falsification of paper records.<P>

The agency agrees that certain controls, such as system validation, are necessary to maintain the
integrity of electronic documents it reviews and collects as part of its enforcement activities.  It
is also necessary for FDA to be able to review and copy electronic records in the same manner as
paper records.  Accordingly, the proposed rule contains several provisions designed to ensure
that the agency's enforcement responsibilities are not impeded.  For example, proposed Section
11.10(b), regarding the ability to generate true copies of electronic records that FDA can inspect,
review, and copy, is intended to ensure that the agency will retain the ability to review electronic
records on site and review copies of such records off site, in the same manner as is currently the
case for paper records.  Likewise, proposed Section 11.10(e), regarding time stamped audit trails
to document record changes, is intended to ensure that changes to electronic records are evident
and reviewable by the agency, to the same extent as paper records.<P>

The agency encourages persons to consult with FDA prior to implementing electronic records
systems if there are any questions regarding the ability of the agency to review and copy the
electronic records.  The proposed rule includes wording to that effect.<P>

 <LI>Controls for Open Systems (Section 11.30)<P>

As discussed above, many comments to the ANPRM acknowledged that additional security
measures, above and beyond those used for closed systems, may be needed to ensure the
integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of electronic records within open systems.  The agency
agrees.  FDA is aware that two kinds of additional systems controls can be effective in this
regard--use of document encryption, and use of digital signature standards. <P>

Digital signature standards use established mathematical algorithms and public and private
signer numerical codes (called keys) to both authenticate an electronic record and establish its
integrity.  Several comments addressed these additional measures.<P>

Accordingly, proposed Section 11.30 requires use of those controls identified in proposed
Section 11.10 for closed systems (as appropriate to the nature of the records at issue) plus such
additional measures as document encryption and use of digital signature standards acceptable to
FDA, as necessary to maintain record confidentiality and integrity under the circumstances.  The
agency intends to publish future guidance documents which identify acceptable digital signature
standards.<P>

 <LI>Signature Manifestations (Section 11.50)<P>

Proposed Section 11.50 requires several of the system controls suggested by comments to the
ANPRM.  This section requires electronically signed records to display the printed name of the
signer and the date and time when the document was signed.  The presence of the printed name,
date, and time will assist the agency by clearly identifying the signing individual.  In addition,
the printed information will help firms to maintain an unambiguous method of readily and
directly documenting the signer's identity and date of signing for as long as the electronic record
is retained.  Another benefit to having the name of the signer appear on the electronic document
is to reinforce the solemnity and personal commitment associated with the act of signing.<P>

Proposed Section 11.50 also requires that the meaning associated with the act of signing the
electronic document be clearly indicated.  As discussed in the ANPRM, the purpose of a
signature can be varied (e.g., to affirm, review, approve, or indicate a person's presence or
action).  Many traditional paper records already contain statements that indicate the purpose of a
signature, such as &quot;material added by * * *,&quot; &quot;in witness thereof,&quot; and
&quot;approved by * * *.&quot;  The agency believes it is vital, for purposes of accurate
documentation and establishment of individual responsibility, to include such statements in
electronic records as well.<P>

 <LI>Signature/Record Binding (Section 11.70)<P>

Signatures appearing on conventional paper documents cannot be readily excised, copied, or
transferred to other documents so as to falsify another document.  Attempts at such misdeeds can
generally be revealed by available forensic methods.  Such is not typically the case, however,
with electronic signatures and handwritten signatures executed to electronic records (the image
of the signature may be electronically &quot;copied&quot; from one location and
&quot;pasted&quot; to another without evidence of the action.)  In such cases, falsification of
electronic documents would be relatively easy to achieve, yet difficult to detect.  This problem
could be solved by using available technologies to bind the signature to the electronic document
in a secure manner analogous to the way conventional signatures are affixed to paper
records.<P>

As discussed above, two ANPRM comments specifically addressed signature to record binding. 
One comment stated that signatures recorded electronically, if not somehow inalterably bound to
the electronic document, are insecure to the extent the digitally recorded signature could be
excised and superimposed upon other documents to falsify an endorsement.  Another comment
supported signatures recorded electronically when they are captured to inalterable media, such as
optical disks, provided, further, that access to such media is limited, thus reducing chances of
alteration.<P>

The agency agrees with the ANPRM comments and believes it is vital to verifiably bind a signed
electronic record to its electronic or handwritten signature.  Accordingly, proposed Section 11.70
includes a &quot;signature to document&quot; binding requirement to ensure that the signatures
cannot be excised, copied or otherwise transferred so as to falsify another record.  The agency
believes that such binding is readily achievable under current technology.  For example, the
concept of such binding is part of digital signature standards to the extent that a message
authentication operation will fail for a falsified document if the document's digital signature had
been copied from a different document.<P>

C.  Electronic Signatures (Subpart C)<P>

Proposed subpart C includes requirements for system controls that are relevant to electronic
signatures.  Here, as elsewhere throughout the proposed rule, the controls reflect suggestions
made by the ANPRM comments.  In addition, the agency is including a requirement for
providing certification to the agency that the electronic signature systems and, if necessary,
specific electronic signatures are authentic, valid, and binding.<P>
</OL>
<OL>
 <LI>General Requirements (Section 11.100)<P>

Proposed Section 11.100 requires each electronic signature to be unique to one individual and
requires the issuing authority (for example, a systems security unit within a firm) to verify a
person's identity before issuing an electronic signature.  FDA considers these controls to be
fundamental to the basic integrity of an electronic signature.  Uniqueness is important because, if
two or more people are assigned the same electronic signature (such as a combination of
identification code and password) then the true identity of the signer could be in doubt and either
of the two individuals could conceivably readily repudiate the recorded signature as not being
his/her own.  It is important for the assigning authority to verify a person's identity before issuing
an electronic signature to prevent that person from wrongfully assuming someone else's identity
and the privileges/authorizations that may be associated with that identity.<P>

The agency is including a proposed requirement for providing certification to the agency that the
electronic signature system guarantees the authenticity, validity, and binding of any electronic
signature.  Furthermore, upon agency request, additional certification or testimony that a specific
electronic signature is authentic, valid, and binding shall be provided.  The certification should
be submitted to the agency district office in which territory the electronic signature system is in
use.<P>

 <LI>Identification Mechanisms and Controls (Section 11.200)<P>

As noted above, electronic signatures are broadly based upon various combinations of what a
person knows (such as a secret password), what a person possesses (such as an employee badge),
and what a person is.  The third element, what a person is, relates to what the agency is defining
as a &quot;biometric/behavioral link&quot; to an individual--a method of verifying a person's
identity based on measurement of the person's physical feature(s) or repeatable actions. 
Examples of such features or actions include voiceprints, handprints, retinal scans, and the act of
signing one's name in script.  The most important attribute of an electronic signature that
incorporates a biometric/behavioral link is that the measured feature or action is inherently
unique to, and remains with, that individual.  Unlike what a person knows or possesses, what a
person &quot;is&quot; cannot be compromised by being lost, stolen, forgotten, loaned,
re-assigned, or otherwise compromised by ordinary means.<P>

Accordingly the agency is establishing two broad categories of electronic signatures, those based
on biometric/behavioral links to individuals, and those that lack such links, as reflected in
proposed Section 11.200.<P>

Many of the ANPRM comments argued persuasively that FDA should not require
biometric/behavioral links, but should accept electronic signatures that lack such links provided
the electronic signatures are validated, secure, and administered under adequate system controls. 
Among those controls, comments emphasized the importance of maintaining electronic
signatures that are made of multiple identification mechanisms (such as a combined
identification code and password) and administrative measures to ensure that attempted use of an
individual's electronic signature by anyone other than its genuine owner requires collaboration of
two or more individuals.  Such collaboration would prevent signature falsification by casual
mishap--a falsification that might result, for example, if someone acquired another person's
unattended identification card or token.  The provision would also help to impress people with
the significance and solemnity of the electronic signature.<P>

The agency agrees that biometric/behavioral links should not be a required feature of electronic
signatures, at this time.  The agency also agrees that electronic signatures that lack
biometric/behavioral links should be acceptable when certain system controls are used. <P>

Accordingly, the agency has incorporated system controls for electronic signatures that lack such
links, including multiple identification mechanisms and multiple party collaboration in proposed
Section 11.200(a).<P>

Although FDA is not, at this time, mandating use of biometric/behavioral links inelectronic
signatures, it is allowing for them and encourages their development and use.  The premise
behind the technology for electronic signatures based upon biometric/behavioral links is that the
links are inherently secure such that a person's electronic signature could not be lost, stolen,
loaned, or otherwise used by anyone other than the rightful owner.  The agency is proposing to
codify that premise at Section 11.200(b), to ensure that electronic signatures based on such links
are designed so that they cannot be used by anyone other than their genuine owners.<P>

 <LI>Controls for Identification Codes/Passwords (Section 11.300)<P>

The agency is aware that many electronic signatures are based upon combined identification
codes and passwords.  FDA believes that because of the relative ease with which such electronic
signatures may be compromised, and because of their wide adoption, system controls to ensure
their security and integrity merit specific coverage in these regulations.<P>

Many of the ANPRM comments addressed specific administrative controls to ensure the security
and integrity of electronic signatures that are based upon a combined identification code and
password.  One comment suggested eight controls specific to identification codes.  The agency
appreciates the various suggestions and agrees that five of them merit codification at this time. 
Proposed Section 11.300 includes those controls.  Suggested controls that were not included in
the proposed rule may be added in the future or addressed in future agency guidelines.<P>

The agency wishes to emphasize that the controls listed in proposed Section 11.300 are not
intended to be all inclusive of what may be needed to ensure the security and integrity of
electronic signatures based on identification codes/passwords.<P>

XII.  ANALYSIS OF IMPACTS</A><P>

FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354).  Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess
all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to
select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic,
environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distribute impacts; and equity). 
The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and
principles identified in the Executive Order.  In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant
regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the
Executive Order.<P>

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would
minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities.  Because this action will permit
industry to maintain records in electronic form, and thus reduce their paperwork costs, the
agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities.  Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further
analysis is required.<P>

XIII.  PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT OF 1980</A><P>

This proposed rule contains information collections which are subject to review by the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.  The title,
description, and recordkeepers of the information collections are shown below with an estimate
of the recordkeeping burden.<P>

Title:  Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures; Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations;
Proposed Rule.<P>

Description:  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing rules to provide criteria for
acceptance of electronic records, electronic signatures, and handwritten signatures onto
electronic records useable in place of paper records.  Rules apply to any 21 CFR records
retention requirement unless specifically exempt by future regulation.  Records required to be
submitted to FDA may be submitted electronically provided the agency has stated its ability to
accept the records electronically in an agency established public docket.<P>

Description of Recordkeepers:  State or local governments, businesses and other
for-profitorganizations, Federal agencies, and non-profit institutions.<P>

XVI.  COMMENTS</A><P>
Interested persons may, on or before November 29, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management
Branch (address above) written comments regarding this proposal.  Two copies of any comments
are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy.  Comments are to be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. <P>

Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through
Friday.  As an FDA experiment in accepting public comments by electronic mail (e-mail),
interested persons may also submit comments via INTERNET (address above).  Comments must
be in ASCII format. Any exhibits or other attachments submitted must also be in ASCII format
and must be part of the e-mail itself.  The agency has limited experience with receiving e-mail
via INTERNET, and is aware that it is possible for some messages not to arrive at their intended
destinations, or to arrive with incomplete or otherwise inaccurate contents.  FDA is concerned
that all comments it receives on this proposal are intact, accurate and complete, as intended by
respondents.  Therefore, for this experiment, FDA encourages interested persons who elect to
send their comments by e-mail to also send two paper copies of their comments to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above).<P>
